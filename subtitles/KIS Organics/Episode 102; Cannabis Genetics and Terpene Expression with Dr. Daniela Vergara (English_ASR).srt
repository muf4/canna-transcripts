crop Dr vergar's scientific Publications

24
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,200
include the comparison of the

25
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,179
cannabinoids by the federally produced

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,280
cannabis to that produced by the private

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,080
Market these results were featured in

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,859
news platforms such as the Atlantic

29
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,658
science and 538 recently she published a

30
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,340
comparison between the Genome of these

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,020

tools available for cannabis research

37
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,859
that was featured in science and the

38
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,839

48
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,200
hi Daniella thanks for coming on the

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,899
show today

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
hi Taz thank you for having me yeah I'm

51
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,140
excited that we're getting the

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,239
opportunity to talk why don't we start

53
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,840
off by giving listeners a little bit of

54
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,840
your background

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,599
[Music]

56
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,799
virgin crop Specialists and I am working

57
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,219
with

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,800
um M and Ops

59
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,859
um and I am a lecturer at the University

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,020
of Colorado in Boulder where I was for

61
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,180
eight years

62
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,939
um as a researcher and I still have some

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,060
uh ongoing research projects at CU

64
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,079
Boulder as well

65
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,420
okay so let's talk a little bit about

66
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,180
what that role is exactly as an emerging

67
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,619
crop specialist what uh

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,019
what does that mean like what's your

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,239
day-to-day look like

70
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,900
my day-to-day it's very flexible

71
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,659
um

72
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,000
but I have to go to meet a bunch of

73
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,098
people in New York state that are

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,560
related to

75
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:11,759
um the Cannabis industry

76
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,098
um for example Growers that are

77
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,318
growing uh cannabis work multiple

78
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:19,139
purposes whether it's for cannabinoids

79
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,119
or for fiber or for grain there's not a

80
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,738
lot of people growing for brain for

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,000
example but that's something that I hope

82
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:30,959
changes but also uh figuring out how to

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,939
help the industry Thrive so people that

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,340
are processors or I had a great meeting

85
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:40,859
last Thursday or Friday with this

86
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,000
company that has that they're doing

87
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,400
biochar and they're doing vinegar and so

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,158
they're now trying to do it with him and

89
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,120
how to figure out how to get all of the

90
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:58,560
Cannabis according for waste from these

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,080
um Growers into their facilities and and

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,378
make possibilities right and if you're

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,019
growing cannabis for cannabinoids your

94
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,060
stocks could be huge

95
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,640
um you can have these these massive

96
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,819
plants so how are you gonna

97
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,279
get that stock into tiny little chunks

98
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,379
what sort of equipment you need in order

99
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,500
for there to go to this machine that is

100
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:25,978
called a killing machine that makes the

101
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,259
vinegar and the biochar so we were

102
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:31,500
thinking about those things

103
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,819
so a better use for all the biomass

104
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,918
that's produced

105
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,478
during cannabis production

106
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,319
yes

107
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,319
so so because

108
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,418
because for fiber is getting a lot of

109
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,758
traction and there's companies that want

110
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,159
to get hemp for fiber and so you in

111
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,379
order for you to make a t-shirt

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
you need a facility that it's a big

113
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:57,600
facility and it's a multi-million dollar

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,879
facility how do you establish that and

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,860
then farmers are not going to start

116
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,379
growing hemp for fiber if they don't

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,120
have a buyer but the buyer is not here

118
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,740
because no one is producing it so it's

119
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,620
kind of like how do you break that

120
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,600
chicken and egg situation

121
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,459
um and also for grain right so now

122
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,500
there's people that are interested in

123
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,299
Grain but not a lot of people are

124
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,800
producing grain so how do we get that

125
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,560
started

126
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,379
so your role is to sort of support the

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,199
entire industry and make connections for

128
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,538
folks as a way of of sort of building it

129
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,800
within the state it sounds like you and

130
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,360
I haven't really talked about your role

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,280
exactly this is sort of off the cuff

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
we've been talking more about your

133
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,939
background in genetics which we'll get

134
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
to here in a second but I was curious to

135
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,600
learn just a bit more about exactly what

136
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,879
you're doing

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,759
and you you said it yeah and get

138
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,219
established connections and then put two

139
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,560
plus two together and figure out how

140
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,600
we're gonna get so for example with this

141
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,418
company it's like okay really what we

142
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,960
need to do is a transportation company

143
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:03,120
we need trucks to go from one place to

144
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,239
another and then is that profitable

145
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,300
right taking out all of those waste and

146
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,160
if you're in one side of the of the

147
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,978
state which for me New York state is a

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,479
new state I I moved here recently but if

149
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,579
you're in one of the corners of the

150
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:20,099
state for example in New York City does

151
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:23,579
that make sense to to take all of the

152
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,800
waste to let's say Buffalo right yeah

153
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,899
um so so figuring those things out but

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,960
basically that is my role right now I

155
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,359
think we're now yeah wonderful wonderful

156
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,239
very cool now your background though is

157
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,560
is wildly different with your background

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,418
in genetics

159
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,418
um I recently listened to one of your

160
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:44,159
webinars and uh do you want to just plug

161
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:46,560
the webinar series really quickly before

162
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,620
we talk about your webinar um so folks

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,600
can can learn about that

164
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,220
what I talked about in the webinar well

165
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,620
can you talk just really quickly about

166
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,539
what the series is that Cornell offers

167
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,399
for folks like I was able to listen to

168
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,500
this for free

169
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,779
um to your your webinar but there's

170
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,538
other ones that you you guys put on

171
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,818
as well so that one particularly was

172
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:11,279
between the USDA and Cornell it was a

173
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,919
collaboration and it was a webinar

174
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,198
regarding

175
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,839
um cannabis in general so there were

176
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,300
people talking about the economics

177
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,818
um there were people talking about uh

178
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,120
how you process it

179
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,740
um and I talked about the genetics part

180
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,560
but

181
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,000
um but yeah there were

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,019
multiple different talks it was I think

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,560
it was every other Wednesday for four

184
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,779
months the the spring semester and so

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,120
there were multiple talks in multiple

186
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,339
different subjects regarding cannabis

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,860
and the videos are all now on available

188
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,299
on YouTube I saw on YouTube exactly so

189
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,740
folks can check those out I'll put a

190
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,960
link in the podcast if people want to go

191
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,259
back and see what was offered there from

192
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,698
uh Cornell in the USDA and thank you I

193
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,060
didn't make all the webinars but I was

194
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,419
able to attend yours where you talked

195
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,560
about uh cannabis genetics and some of

196
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,639
your research that you've done around

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,639
cannabis genetics

198
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,740
um can you talk a little bit about some

199
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,359
of that research and what your findings

200
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,240
were

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,400
absolutely I mean I I will I've been

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,160
doing that for eight years so there's a

203
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,378
lot there's multiple

204
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,080
podcast contents that we can have

205
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,300
regarding all of my findings but uh but

206
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,399
yes so what I what I did and what I

207
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,799
continue to do with the University of

208
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,580
Colorado in Boulder

209
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,439
um is looking uh The genome the entire

210
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,479
genome so it's basically more genomic

211
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,760
genetics because genetics is more

212
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,519
looking at particular genes but genomics

213
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,220
you look at the entire genome

214
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,799
um and look at uh the different parts of

215
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,860
the genome right because the genome is

216
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,719
composed of multiple different parts

217
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,519
um you have for example that repetitive

218
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,940
contents of the genome which people call

219
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,159
the junk DNA which you know it's

220
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,500
repetitive right so you have a bunch of

221
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,519
things that look alike and are

222
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,080
pardon our founding scattered throughout

223
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,600
the genome

224
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,420
um so we have a paper trying to describe

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,860
the the repetitive contents of the

226
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,259
genome that was published I think that

227
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,720
was 2019

228
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,319
um I looked at the

229
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,778
um uh the cannabinoid genes I have done

230
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,320
a work in the hanabinoid genes as well

231
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:35,939
and looking at how these cannabinoid

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
genes

233
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,120
um

234
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,059
have different copies the different

235
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,019
varieties different strains

236
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,000
varying the number of copies of

237
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,360
cannabinoid genes that's something that

238
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,899
I did as well also characterizing where

239
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,899
do these different varieties fall right

240
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,120
like are all

241
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,879
um I don't know blue dreams related to

242
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,379
all blue dreams and all of the

243
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,379
um I don't know Girl Scout cookies

244
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:05,939
related to Girl Scout cookies and we

245
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,700
find that that's not necessarily the

246
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,920
case there are some for example Durban

247
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,540
poisons the ones that we sequenced right

248
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,559
when you sequence a genome you take all

249
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,719
of the

250
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,159
letters of the DNA and you kind of

251
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,839
transcribe them and then you compare

252
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,299
them right so you compare for example

253
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,640
yours and your daughters and you see how

254
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:25,439
similar they are and then you compare to

255
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,879
me right and you're gonna find that

256
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
yours and your daughters are much more

257
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,939
similar than either of you are to me

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,299
um well we found for example that

259
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,519
strains that are named

260
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,439
um Girl Scout cookies they may not be

261
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,659
related at all

262
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,700
um and strain can I ask you a question

263
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,838
about that now when you talk about

264
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,300
cookies I think of a very distinct

265
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,160
morphological plant structure like it's

266
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,019
gonna it's going to like I can look at a

267
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,458
plant and say okay that that probably

268
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,578
has some

269
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:01,739
cookies genetics in it or something did

270
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:04,559
you guys look at that by chance or were

271
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,000
you strictly looking at at the genetic

272
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,359
code

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,458
we were strictly looking at the genome

274
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,459
and then how were you determining

275
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:17,278
whether or not a plant fell into

276
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,778
was being classified as Girl Scout

277
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,139
cookies for example were you going just

278
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,820
strictly off how the name was listed or

279
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,500
known publicly based on how people were

280
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,320
describing it either the breeder or

281
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,820
grower or the grower yeah they would

282
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,820
tell us what is it that's okay

283
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,519
yeah

284
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,419
I you know that would fit with sort of

285
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,799
what

286
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,958
I think a lot of people think

287
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,419
anecdotally is that you know these names

288
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,299
these cultivars are not necessarily what

289
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,578
we thought they were

290
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,319
um yeah so your your findings on that

291
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:51,239
was essentially that

292
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,920
just because something was named Girl

293
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,778
Scout cookies didn't actually mean it

294
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,099
was related to other things named Girl

295
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,078
Scout cookies

296
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,079
exactly were you able to determine

297
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,000
exactly what was truly

298
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,859
you know in this case that particular

299
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,559
Cult of our goals Girl Scout cookies did

300
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,539
you have like a known

301
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,639
a known one that you could work off of

302
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,958
work backwards from I guess

303
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,399
so we had multiple Girl Scout cookies

304
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,778
and what we found is that these Girl

305
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,100
Scout cookies could be related to

306
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,379
something else there was one in

307
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,139
particular that was related to a strain

308
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,939
Jack Herrera we actually had two strains

309
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,019
that carrier that were not related to

310
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,800
each other

311
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:35,159
to each other as well so

312
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,958
so this is my take-home message right my

313
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,620
take-home message and when people ask me

314
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:43,679
about it what I tell them is look

315
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,959
go to a dispensary get whatever it is

316
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,578
that works for you whether that's name

317
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,219
Girl Scout cookies or whether that's

318
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:53,879
name pen doesn't matter

319
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,560
uh and if it works for you for whatever

320
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,600
it is that you're using it whether it's

321
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,099
for sleeping or especially for medical

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,320
patients right because if you're doing

323
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,579
it recreationally I mean I hope that you

324
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,500
have fun with whatever it is that you

325
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:07,319
got to take but if you're for medical

326
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,958
patients then go back to that same

327
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,940
dispensary and get the same thing

328
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:15,599
whether it's called again Girl Scout

329
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:18,300
cookies or pen get it again and then if

330
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,459
you go to another dispensary

331
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,740
um try to ask for the same thing and use

332
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,958
it but chances are that you're not gonna

333
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,778
get the same effect the chances are

334
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,919
pretty big so you're not gonna get the

335
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:30,179
same effects

336
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,219
now I

337
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,319
you know you and I can see each other

338
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,339
right now and I realize uh listeners of

339
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,379
the podcast don't know you're holding

340
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,940
you're actually holding up a marking pen

341
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,379
and that's what you're referencing pen

342
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,839
is the other name

343
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,578
um but I I guess I would take it a step

344
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,220
further I wonder so if you go to the

345
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,059
same let's say you go to a dispensary

346
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,700
um

347
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,619
and get Girl Scout cookies

348
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,420
couldn't that girl scout cookies from a

349
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,240
different farm at the same dispensary

350
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,099
give you an entirely different effect

351
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,379
and then to take that even one step

352
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,120
further couldn't that same Girl Scout

353
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:07,379
cookie plant

354
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,600
that was grown in another facility exact

355
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,220
same cultivar or even the cultivar

356
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,019
within the same facility if it's grown

357
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,700
differently you know under different

358
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,679
environmental conditions whether that's

359
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,440
nutrients media if the farm changes

360
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,179
something if they have uh you know

361
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,000
changed their lighting couldn't that

362
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:26,659
also affect your your expression Cameo

363
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,679
expression to where as a medical patient

364
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,480
you're not going to get a consistent

365
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,278
response and so it becomes really

366
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,519
daunting to really know

367
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:38,338
what's out there at all I guess

368
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,100
that is a great question and so you're

369
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:44,040
going to somewhere any physical

370
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,500
characteristic is a product of genes and

371
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,259
environments right yes

372
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,519
um so nature and nurture

373
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,319
um there are some physical

374
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,539
characteristics that are more

375
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,879
environmentally determined there are

376
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:59,939
others that are more a genetically

377
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,078
determined for example weight is a

378
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,180
characteristic that is very

379
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,638
environmentally determined depending on

380
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,859
how you eat weight can change or not

381
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,480
right so yield in this case too if we're

382
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,240
talking about cannabis

383
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,480
is more Perhaps Perhaps but we don't

384
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,419
entirely know we know that cannabinoids

385
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,699
there is a big genetic component to

386
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,360
cannabinoids we know that but we don't

387
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:27,859
know how much of the cannabinoid

388
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,539
phenotype is genetic and how much is

389
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,539
environmental we know that it's there is

390
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,679
a genetic component and we know that if

391
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:38,519
your parents

392
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:42,419
so for example there's this paper from

393
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,679
2014 by Nora volkov the Nida

394
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,379
um the head of naida the National

395
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,419
Institute on drug abuse I really like

396
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,519
that paper despite its name its name is

397
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:52,139
something like the harmful effects of

398
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,578
cannabis and they never really talk

399
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,299
about the harmful effects of cannabis

400
00:15:53,578 --> 00:16:00,659
but they have a really good figure that

401
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:03,000
shows how THC

402
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:06,539
um amounts have increased through time

403
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,679
that makes us think that breeders and

404
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,379
Growers

405
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,539
have used

406
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:14,338
those individuals that have the most THC

407
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:17,159
to be the parents of Next Generation

408
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:20,339
offspring that makes us think that

409
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:24,419
cannabis is that that THC is a heritable

410
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:26,940
component in cannabis right so in humans

411
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,919
for example height is extremely

412
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,260
heritable if you're tall it's likely

413
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:34,979
that your kids are gonna be tall is

414
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:38,039
something like 80 heritable the other 20

415
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,740
is environment if you didn't eat the

416
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,659
right uh food especially when you were

417
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,698
growing up you're not going to achieve

418
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:47,819
that amount of height that you could

419
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:50,758
have if you had eaten the right

420
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,879
um diet right so with cannabinoids we

421
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,379
think it's similar you have the

422
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,899
potential of producing a bunch of

423
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:59,458
cannabinoids depending on your genes but

424
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,440
you could achieve it depending on

425
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,659
whether you have the right soil the

426
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,939
light is super important

427
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,338
um right so so the right conditions so

428
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:11,640
we do know that there is a identity

429
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:13,019
component but uh but it all depends on

430
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,520
the environment

431
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,039
now if we were talking about another

432
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,078
crop that wasn't cannabis something

433
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,418
that's you know understood genetically

434
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:25,019
like very well

435
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:27,360
like corn or corn you know some other

436
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:28,619
major crop wheat whatever whatever that

437
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,979
may be

438
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:34,739
can can you give us more could you could

439
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,019
you give us more definitively an idea of

440
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,579
how much is heritable in terms of

441
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,859
characteristics versus how much is

442
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,599
environmental is the issue I guess my

443
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,000
question really is is the issue the fact

444
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,980
that there's so much diversity in

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,259
cannabis and we don't really know so

446
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,000
much that much about it or is the issue

447
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,798
just plants in general

448
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,759
when it comes to understand genetics

449
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,980
like this

450
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,779
no I think it's cannabis

451
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,038
this because I mean for multiple reasons

452
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,319
right

453
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,579
the eagle for so long because kind of

454
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,740
has not been

455
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,178
cultivated

456
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,900
um in um

457
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:12,600
in a very scientific manner right

458
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,960
um with corn for example we know that

459
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:19,259
there are particular cultivars that are

460
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,120
for sweet corn right

461
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:23,099
um and so there is a genetic component

462
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,259
to it

463
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:27,298
um now

464
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:29,038
again we know that in cannabis there is

465
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,440
a genetic component to it if you are

466
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,720
gonna cultivate for cannabinoids for THC

467
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,779
or CBD you're not going to use a fiber

468
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,058
cultivar right so we we know that that

469
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:42,058
exists now

470
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:44,579
for example the word cultivar means

471
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:46,440
individuals that have been cultivated

472
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:48,418
for particular reasons and I don't think

473
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,640
that we are there in cannabis right so

474
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,620
we can see it in in

475
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
at least in the Cannabis industry for

476
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:58,079
for recreational purposes for for

477
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,279
marijuana you can see that these names

478
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:04,319
do not mean much and the names also in

479
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,379
the castle hybrid they do not mean much

480
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,119
either so that's why for medical

481
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,740
patients that's what I recommend go to

482
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,019
the same distance the same thing because

483
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,220
you know that hopefully it's going to be

484
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,400
the same grower that it's going to be

485
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,380
using the same soil or or cocoa or the

486
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,600
same nutrient regime

487
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,660
um and hopefully it's going to be the

488
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,519
same variety right it's gonna be a

489
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,400
mother or or the daughter of that mother

490
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,139
plant right so so you're expecting it to

491
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,720
be consistent at least with that same

492
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,360
dispensary

493
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,279
yes as I was ex this was explained to me

494
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,439
the term cultivar is really the best

495
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,119
term to use for what we're talking about

496
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,860
with cannabis you know sort of what

497
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,219
people are calling strains because it's

498
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:49,558
really a cultivated variety

499
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,980
um which is how cultivar was described

500
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:55,859
to me by my uh Bonnie professor which

501
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,179
allows like he's me it's my mnemonic for

502
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:58,918
how I remember that it's not really

503
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,038
varietal it's a it's a cultivated

504
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,259
varietal so it's a ver it's a cultivar

505
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:06,440
yeah but then you're expecting it to

506
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:08,400
have particular

507
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,320
phenotypic characteristics right so

508
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,960
you're expecting it to have for example

509
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,460
I don't know the stock diameter is blah

510
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,019
and the height is blah and the

511
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,460
cannabinoid production is black so you

512
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,980
know exactly what you're getting right

513
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,960
so I usually talk about dogs because

514
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,940
people you know people care about dogs

515
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,460
and people I guess but when you think

516
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,200
about ashiwawa you are and I tell you

517
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,000
Chihuahua you close your eyes and you

518
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,120
picture ashiwawa you do not picture our

519
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,619
Rottweiler yes so they have been bred

520
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,899
for this particular

521
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:39,839
conditions which we do not have in

522
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,059
cannabis right and something that we do

523
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,939
find looking at the genome is that there

524
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:46,980
is a lot of variation right and if the

525
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,019
word on the street is right that for

526
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,880
example

527
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,519
Camp dog number one and can cancel

528
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,919
number four so number one was the first

529
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,779
seed that popped or the first one and

530
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,179
then Ken book number four was the fourth

531
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:03,720
one but they are siblings and yet they

532
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:07,860
have entirely different phenotypes

533
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,558
so you have full sibs that are entirely

534
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:13,139
different from each other and that means

535
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,119
that there is a lot of variation that

536
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,460
it's out there and that when you're

537
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,178
doing crosses you don't know what to

538
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,279
expect when you are crossing a female on

539
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:26,700
the male and I think that that's why

540
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:29,279
it's so popular to

541
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,220
to have mother plants and to do cloning

542
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,440
because then that way you are having

543
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,480
more consistency right because the

544
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,240
breeding has not been

545
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,880
um done in a

546
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,500
enough inbreeding for multiple

547
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,900
Generations you don't you don't find

548
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,400
when you talk to to people in the

549
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,840
industry it's like oh yeah it's you know

550
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,340
like four generations in breeding and

551
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,139
it's like well no you need several

552
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,418
generations to assure

553
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,880
that there's going to be homozygosity

554
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,259
which means that you know the gene

555
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
coming from Mom and the gene coming from

556
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:02,579
that are going to be the same that

557
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,179
they're going to be homozygous right

558
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:07,918
um so so you need multiple Generations

559
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:10,798
uh of inbreeding that has not been done

560
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,220
you know maybe 20 at least

561
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,440
at least eight or twelve and that is not

562
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,179
common so you get a bunch of different

563
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,919
things when you cross two individuals

564
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,500
like 12 Planters or plant you know high

565
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,600
cannabinoids or cannabinoids right

566
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,220
so in order to be a cultivar it needs to

567
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,439
have a consistent

568
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,538
expression is essentially we're saying

569
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,279
and we're not there yet

570
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:35,460
um it wasn't part of the challenge then

571
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,220
for breeders the fact that the general

572
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,960
population you know its consumers are

573
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,779
constantly changing

574
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,700
uh what they want chasing these you know

575
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,960
what people call hype strains this idea

576
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,460
that you know

577
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,919
there's always something better around

578
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,480
the corner

579
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,020
yes

580
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,019
uh

581
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:03,178
and that's why you do Fino hunting

582
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,220
uh right

583
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,500
however that comes with a cost and the

584
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,579
cost is the lack of consistency and the

585
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,099
lack of

586
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:13,798
if you have a limited amount of space

587
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:16,500
and you cross these two plants this

588
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:19,019
female and this male or or use reversed

589
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,538
this female and you're Crossing them

590
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:22,259
and they're awesome both of them are

591
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:25,259
awesome

592
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:26,879
chances are that

593
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,400
their kids

594
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,440
could there could be awesome kids I'm

595
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,480
not that awesome right you can have some

596
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,220
offspring that are not that cool and

597
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,720
then if you have a limited amount of

598
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,159
space you have to choose which ones

599
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,779
you're gonna be

600
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,020
um planting which which seeds you're

601
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:45,000
gonna be popping and and maybe you

602
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,579
didn't pop that one seat that was the

603
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,038
coolest one so

604
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,720
so yeah so consistency brings

605
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,279
consistency when you have inbreeding

606
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,480
then you are assuring that all of your

607
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
individuals are going to be the best

608
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,859
you bring up this the challenges around

609
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,940
breeding um

610
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:09,719
now genetics and testing have allowed

611
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,380
have allowed shortcuts in this process

612
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:17,880
um some of which are more controversial

613
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:21,179
than others uh with with Growers now

614
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:27,600
I could at a very relatively young age

615
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:30,900
know the gender of my plant or no get an

616
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:33,959
idea of what the uh

617
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,480
phenotypic expression might be right

618
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,179
from from testing if we look at the at

619
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,679
the genetic sample

620
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,019
um you know I'm not and this is not

621
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,820
talking about Gene editing at this point

622
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,980
um what what tools are there out there

623
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:50,939
to Growers

624
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,558
um that is that are not I guess Gene

625
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,538
editing

626
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,460
well I don't think that we're engine

627
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:58,319
editing yet

628
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,480
although

629
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,119
it's coming though right it's coming

630
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,339
yeah yeah I mean for any for every crop

631
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,139
right for the strawberries that you had

632
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:09,298
this morning in your cereal yeah for

633
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,020
Rice yeah

634
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:13,980
um

635
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:16,798
but um but there are certain tools look

636
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,798
sex in sex determination sex expression

637
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,339
in cannabis is another big kind of worms

638
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,339
um because

639
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,539
you can sex reverse them right

640
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:31,199
um and so if you put in I don't know

641
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:32,819
collodial silver or silver nitrate they

642
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,259
can produce flowers from the opposite

643
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:36,480
sex

644
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,980
um or atop and in males they can produce

645
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,099
female flowers

646
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,380
so even though there's an accidental Y

647
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:45,658
chromosome like cannabis has an x on Y

648
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,278
chromosomes like we do and we do think

649
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,778
that the X and the Y chromosomes in

650
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,940
cannabis

651
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:54,538
um are very important

652
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,519
to establish sex but we also think that

653
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:59,339
there may be other genes somewhere else

654
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,460
related to sex expression because even

655
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:04,678
if you are on xx and they put silver

656
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,100
nitrate you can produce flowers of the

657
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,080
opposite sex so

658
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:13,139
even if you're not lacking a why right

659
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,960
and there's multiple companies out there

660
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,900
that um

661
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,500
that they have feminized seats so they

662
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,778
take a female they stress it or put

663
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,640
colloidal silver the female produces

664
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:29,400
male flowers and then they use that

665
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,320
pollen to either self-fertilize that

666
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,538
female or to fertilize another female

667
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:36,599
and then you're assuring that there's no

668
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:38,278
Y chromosome right so even if you have

669
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:42,899
that sometimes you can even produce male

670
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:45,839
flowers right so it's likely that the

671
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,038
genes related to sex are found somewhere

672
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,639
else in the genome that are not

673
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:53,640
necessarily DX and the white chromosomes

674
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,299
um I don't know why I started talking

675
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,759
about sex but okay gender identification

676
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:01,859
at earlier stages we don't have to

677
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,500
flower a plant out to determine its

678
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:07,379
genderness

679
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,859
yeah exactly whether you have

680
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,860
there are

681
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:17,640
so yes that is possible that doesn't

682
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,200
tell you whether that individual when

683
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,880
stressed out is going to produce flowers

684
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,100
of the opposite sex it doesn't tell you

685
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,080
or if that individual is a monishes it

686
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,058
doesn't tell you that but it does tell

687
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,759
you whether it's gonna have it has a why

688
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:31,980
so those are available there's also uh

689
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,900
tests related to cannabinoid production

690
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,339
and whether your plant is prone to

691
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:41,400
produce cannabinoids or THC at least

692
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:43,558
um yeah there there are some tests

693
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,360
available are there any available right

694
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,339
now that can give us an idea of terpene

695
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,740
expression is that's become

696
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:52,519
much more important I think to

697
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,519
cultivators

698
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,400
um not that I know of I may be mistaken

699
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,839
but um so we don't know that the genetic

700
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,000
markers for

701
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,720
pining or limonene or any of these

702
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,740
different

703
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,538
um

704
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,538
terpenes that you're aware of

705
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,879
with terpenes

706
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:26,399
there is something that we call

707
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:29,220
pleiotropy on epistasis and they are

708
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,019
interacting to to produce the phenotype

709
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,159
and that means that there could be one

710
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:37,139
gene that affects multiple traits

711
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,220
or that there's

712
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,799
um

713
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,058
one trait that is affected by multiple

714
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,418
genes

715
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:47,819
okay right the opposite so it's not this

716
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,900
causes this it's a more complicated

717
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:51,418
picture

718
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:55,798
yes and there is a paper that I really

719
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:57,960
really like by uh Jordan zagger and his

720
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:00,960
in from Washington State actually yeah

721
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,360
in Oman and he's a his advisor uh Mark

722
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,640
Blanche and they are proposing that

723
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,678
there is this network of genes which I

724
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,360
think that it's very accurately they do

725
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,480
more of mathematical models and stuff

726
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,579
but I I do think that that depict not

727
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,380
only that terpenes but also that can

728
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:18,178
happen it's right it's this complex

729
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,220
network of genes that are acting

730
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,320
together right now I'm working on a

731
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,019
paper

732
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:28,319
and although I'm using

733
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,119
only nine individuals total because for

734
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,278
those nine individuals we have like the

735
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,558
entire genome placed together that we

736
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,720
have the entire puzzle so we were able

737
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,839
to count the genes and to look for the

738
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,700
location of the genes but what we found

739
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,980
is that

740
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,960
um well yeah there are multiple genes

741
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,640
that are related to cannabinoid

742
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,500
Productions

743
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,538
um and for example there's this one

744
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,960
individual cannotonic

745
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:58,980
a and these individual kind of tonic has

746
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,759
truncated to an incomplete CBD Gene and

747
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,798
also an incomplete THC Gene however it

748
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,240
produces CBD and THC

749
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,619
so

750
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,319
there

751
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:12,479
that suggests right like this is not a

752
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,058
definitive answer but it suggests that

753
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,099
there are multiple other genes that are

754
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:19,619
affecting the production of cannabinoids

755
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:21,538
despite the canonical THC and the

756
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:23,158
canonical CBD there's other multiple

757
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:26,038
genes that are affecting the the

758
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,140
production of these cannabinoids

759
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,119
interesting I actually had Jordan on the

760
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,640
podcast to talk about his paper around

761
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:36,000
powdery mildew and a marker that they

762
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,759
had found on that so folks could check

763
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,859
that out now

764
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,359
from what you're saying it it sounds

765
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:44,639
like there's there's quite a bit we just

766
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,459
haven't figured out about the Cannabis

767
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,500
genome and how it's expressed

768
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,179
um what do you think

769
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,819
what do you think the future holds in

770
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,559
terms of research

771
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:58,439
oh there's so many things

772
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:00,480
so many things I mean all of what I said

773
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,980
about sex right like where are the genes

774
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,620
that are related to sex determination

775
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,000
all of the what I said about

776
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:08,579
cannabinoids right like um

777
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,259
are these genes interacting how are

778
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:12,960
these genes related to the expression

779
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:15,419
when you grow I mean good conditions or

780
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,200
in bad conditions how do the Expressions

781
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:21,480
differ and then or terpenes right

782
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,298
um and also

783
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,460
um

784
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:29,398
when do you express certain traits for

785
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:33,000
example in in interpense or in sex right

786
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:34,500
when when would you express like we know

787
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,140
that if we

788
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,898
poor colloidal silver or silver nitrate

789
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:43,620
then it expresses the male flowers but

790
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:46,979
I am applying that chloridal server

791
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:49,439
in nature when why would you do that

792
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,179
like what is the advantage for you to be

793
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,159
producing flowers of the opposite text

794
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:55,440
so so I think that there's so many

795
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,440
questions about it and right now for

796
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
example we do not have an assembly is

797
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,919
when you take the genome right when you

798
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,099
have all of the genome all of the DNA

799
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,440
letters and you transcribe them you have

800
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:10,278
to chop him into little pieces and then

801
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,278
you have to put them together

802
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,580
um and so we have assemblies that are

803
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,140
pretty complete

804
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:18,000
however we're lacking the white

805
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,120
chromosome and we're lacking Dominic's

806
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,380
chromosomes so we still need to complete

807
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,079
those

808
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:29,340
um we haven't done it yet so we're still

809
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:31,259
figuring that out and uh and the end for

810
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:34,019
terpenes right some terpenes are

811
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:36,298
produced when under stress like if

812
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:38,339
you're being eaten by a caterpillar then

813
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:41,339
you produce a terpene

814
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,250
um so when are these serpentes produced

815
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:43,619
how are they produced

816
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,819
[Music]

817
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:46,798
um

818
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,259
if you are the same variety do you put

819
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,158
those different opinions on why

820
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,440
um

821
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,320
and

822
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,880
um yeah all of all of that part like the

823
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,278
phenotype

824
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,559
there's still still a lot of work to do

825
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,720
in the phenotype like and then you put

826
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,759
the genotype and thoughts even more and

827
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,319
then you put expression and that's even

828
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,619
you can add more and more and more

829
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,619
layers

830
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:16,619
do you see us eventually

831
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,740
understanding cannabis as well as we

832
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:22,678
understand a crop like corn or is it

833
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:26,179
just too much genetic diversity and

834
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,340
since we're chasing so many different

835
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:31,159
I guess medical therapeutic or

836
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:35,778
recreational

837
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:38,820
outcomes with this particular plant that

838
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:41,038
will never get the stability to really

839
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,720
get the that would then further lead to

840
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,038
the research that would allow us to like

841
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,440
completely understand what's going on

842
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:51,359
no I think so yeah we have enough tools

843
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,820
we have genetic tools we have smart

844
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,558
people I do think so that that's gonna

845
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:58,259
happen

846
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,599
um I think that much faster than it

847
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,278
happened to many other crops because we

848
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,199
have the tools available and it has been

849
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,000
done for other crops right so it's kind

850
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,599
of like taking what has been done in

851
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,940
rice or in tomatoes and then applying it

852
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:14,820
uh I think

853
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,579
the other thing in cannabis is that

854
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,139
first

855
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,039
people think that they're gonna make

856
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,519
money

857
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:25,320
right now like okay like this is it and

858
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,579
I'm gonna make money tomorrow and

859
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,320
science is slow and breeding is low and

860
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:32,878
bringing differs depending on the

861
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,220
environment right

862
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,980
whatever you have in Oregon may not work

863
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,299
here in New York whatever you have there

864
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,820
in Washington

865
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,760
where you are may not work here or may

866
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,559
not work in Colorado right

867
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,280
um yeah as a cultivator we see genetics

868
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:54,838
plays a you know a significantly

869
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,839
heritable role when it comes to

870
00:34:54,838 --> 00:35:00,239
um disease for example well and yield

871
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,440
but I mean particularly disease you know

872
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,118
we'll have

873
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,559
um with an outdoor crop or even with an

874
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,940
indoor facility and there's certain

875
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,559
environmental conditions you'll always

876
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,880
have certain plants that will thrive in

877
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:12,000
certain plants that will suffer because

878
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,000
most Growers I know are running you know

879
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,219
20 30 sometimes 40 different cultivars

880
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,880
or more

881
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:20,519
varietals whatever you want to call them

882
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,519
in their in their facility or in their

883
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,858
field and and we do see that certain

884
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,179
you know certain plants will suffer more

885
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:30,000
than others and certain plants will

886
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:31,858
thrive in the exact same

887
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,338
environmental condition

888
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:38,039
so we know genetics plays you know a

889
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:40,500
fairly large role right I mean we don't

890
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,838
know exactly how large but

891
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,000
pretty large what interests me I think

892
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,279
is figuring out how if we took

893
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
particular genetics

894
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,119
um

895
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,099
how we maximize the genetic potential of

896
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,800
that plant so if we took you know

897
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,079
whatever you mentioned you know chem dog

898
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,180
number four figure out exactly how that

899
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,960
plant likes to be grown that we could

900
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:05,338
cater our lighting our nutrients our our

901
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,460
media

902
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:10,320
our environment to really optimize

903
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,780
whatever particular cannabinoid

904
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,820
expression or terpene expression that we

905
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,519
that we really want from a plant like

906
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,200
that to me is is really

907
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,880
the most interesting because right now

908
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,059
as a grower I'm just trying to create

909
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,519
conditions that are optimal for most of

910
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:29,420
my plants to at least achieve a certain

911
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,820
amount of yield or a certain expression

912
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,619
that I know that the general public or

913
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,838
the the medical community is going to

914
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,200
want to purchase right

915
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,880
mm-hmm but yeah you know how do we take

916
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:45,480
that a step further to where we really

917
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,400
dial it in by you know eventually a

918
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,059
cultivar but let's say a varietal

919
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,639
um

920
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,119
how do we get there what's that process

921
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,118
look like

922
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:57,118
complicated question but I do

923
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,358
think that if you're growing indoors

924
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,119
it's much easier right because

925
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:05,940
you have uh the environment is constant

926
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,380
and what I've seen for example I have a

927
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,838
friend in

928
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,599
in Denver what he does is that he has

929
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:16,679
his set conditions and this is the light

930
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,900
regime this is a nutrient regime and if

931
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,199
this variety does well here perfect if

932
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,838
not you're out like he doesn't adequate

933
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,939
the nutrients and over that conditions

934
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:31,619
to the variety but the opposite so there

935
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:33,720
are only certain strains that he grows

936
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:36,180
um which I think it's pretty smart you

937
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:38,459
know like he already has this

938
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:40,500
this figured out like okay this is going

939
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,740
to be the light this is going to be and

940
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,239
then he brings varieties or not

941
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:49,139
um so I think that that is pretty smart

942
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:53,338
now if you're growing Outdoors then it's

943
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:57,719
different right then that's then that is

944
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:59,820
where where things get complicated

945
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:03,358
um because as you were saying there's a

946
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,640
bunch of

947
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,400
there is a there's a bunch of things

948
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:11,519
that can happen right

949
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,099
um and disease is one of them for

950
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,639
example that you can't control indoors

951
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:19,260
much more than Outdoors right so so you

952
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,078
need to figure out which ones are those

953
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:25,440
individuals that are resistant and cross

954
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,480
cross those and then that means that you

955
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,920
need to do some sort of inbreeding

956
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,300
because if you're Crossing those and

957
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,858
then again what we were talking about

958
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,079
there's no one breeding so you can get a

959
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:36,239
bunch of different things and height

960
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,300
differences and

961
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,459
all of the phenotypes can vary

962
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,800
um so let's can we talk a little bit

963
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,440
about phenotypes so you you'd written a

964
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,359
authored paper uh called widely assumed

965
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,480
phenotypic associations in Cannabis

966
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:53,519
sativa lack a shared genetic basis

967
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,420
can you just touch on sort of what your

968
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,420
findings were with that

969
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:59,899
that was a nice paper

970
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,280
the paper I want to give a shout out to

971
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,079
Ben Holmes from Centennial seeds and uh

972
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,019
Front Range biosciences because he made

973
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,940
that possible and he's um known breeder

974
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:12,858
in Colorado

975
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,079
um

976
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:17,400
so

977
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,920
we measured a bunch of different

978
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,960
physical characteristics of phenotypes

979
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,420
in these individuals

980
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,980
these were across if they were a cross

981
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,720
between a hemp type and a marijuana type

982
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,539
so we measured a bunch of different

983
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,819
traits I don't know height pedial length

984
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:40,079
Leaf shape we have three different

985
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:42,599
cannabinoids and we found that they are

986
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,500
not correlated so

987
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,760
you cannot correlate the leaf shape with

988
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,719
um percent

989
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,560
THC or you cannot correlate height with

990
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:58,919
Leaf shape or right so you those are

991
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,699
completely not correlated so

992
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,700
there are

993
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,859
people in the industry that can say for

994
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,019
example oh this smells like I don't know

995
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:12,119
lemon or this smells like Pine and

996
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:16,440
therefore it was tall and had broad

997
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,599
leaves which it's not the case right and

998
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,300
how I say it in

999
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,200
how I explain it to people is that you

1000
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,300
cannot

1001
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,578
you cannot say oh you're tall because

1002
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,519
you have blue eyes those traits are

1003
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:31,380
completely not correlated or you have

1004
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,059
brown eyes and therefore you're blonde

1005
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,039
right like those things are completely

1006
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:37,858
not correlated

1007
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,139
um and so in the industry for example

1008
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,460
those things oh it's a broad leaf and

1009
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:43,739
therefore it's

1010
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,720
this type of strain and therefore it's

1011
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,419
this grouping it's a hybrid or it's an

1012
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,980
indie car it's as a tiva that doesn't

1013
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,599
that is completely not related

1014
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,059
whatsoever you can have individuals that

1015
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,800
have broad leaves and have high THC or

1016
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:57,539
individuals that have narrow leave and

1017
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,700
have high THC or individuals that are

1018
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,400
tall and have high THC or individuals

1019
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:05,279
that are short and have high THC that is

1020
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,519
completely not correlated at all

1021
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,400
was there anything from the physical

1022
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:15,599
characteristics of of a plant that

1023
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:19,260
correlated with the medicinal

1024
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,240
therapeutic side the cannabinoid terpene

1025
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,760
you know any of that side of things

1026
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:25,618
nothing no

1027
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,420
I mean we do see correlations between

1028
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,039
the cannabinoids right the cannabinoids

1029
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,139
are very

1030
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,119
all of these genes are acting in unison

1031
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:35,279
all of these genes right they have the

1032
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,519
same precursor molecule which is cbga

1033
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,519
right so cbga them mother cannabinoid

1034
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,920
they all of these different enzymes thca

1035
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,259
synthase cbda synthase cbca synthase

1036
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,059
they act on the same precursor molecule

1037
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,940
so we do see correlations between the

1038
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:53,639
hannabinoids which is expected right but

1039
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:58,380
not at all between height or video

1040
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:59,279
length or Leaf shape or nothing no thank

1041
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,140
you

1042
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,140
interesting interesting so

1043
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,879
yeah I don't really know what to what to

1044
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,858
add to that uh other than that they're

1045
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,420
just there's no correlation so we can't

1046
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:14,279
look at a plant physically and have any

1047
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,960
idea what's going on

1048
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,780
internally in terms of what it's going

1049
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,300
to produce is

1050
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,740
found out yeah these physical traits you

1051
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,980
have to measure them right you have to

1052
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:27,000
measure the THC the CBD and then if you

1053
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,000
do

1054
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,019
breeding you can have

1055
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,400
oh narrow leaves with all of your plants

1056
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,699
could be narrow leaves all of them could

1057
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,220
have like this really thin narrow leaves

1058
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:43,559
and all of them can vary in the amount

1059
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:48,358
of THC that they produce right and

1060
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:50,940
that's so I have been asked before these

1061
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:54,539
questions like okay you found that there

1062
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,700
I had this other paper with the Leafly

1063
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:59,759
with the people from Leafly where we

1064
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:01,980
looked also at the sativa Indica hybrid

1065
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,619
and we found that sativa Indica hybrid

1066
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,719
has no correlation with the cannabinoids

1067
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,700
or the terpenes that the plant produces

1068
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,719
right

1069
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:12,838
um

1070
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:15,118
and we we also know that the genetics

1071
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:17,578
right that the genome does not correlate

1072
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,500
with the Indica sativa hybrid we also

1073
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,640
know that what I we were talking earlier

1074
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,920
that

1075
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,480
you can have a strain named Girl Scout

1076
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,099
cookies and another strain named Girl

1077
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,079
Scout cookies that are not related at

1078
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,940
all whatsoever

1079
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,180
um so when

1080
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,980
when people ask me like okay so what

1081
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,719
does this mean and that for me it means

1082
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,559
that if you have a

1083
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:43,739
High Times best strain

1084
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:46,500
that was this I don't know this

1085
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:48,539
um purple haze or whatever this

1086
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,719
Tangerine Dream

1087
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:52,800
then change the name and next year just

1088
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:54,179
call it

1089
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,599
pen

1090
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:59,818
and it can also be the High Times best

1091
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,380
strain because that doesn't mean

1092
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:03,480
anything the names do not mean anything

1093
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,019
names do not mean anything when it comes

1094
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,659
to the plan okay no no Market it again

1095
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:12,059
and then call it something else like

1096
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:14,940
that is my advice right

1097
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:15,539
it is really challenging

1098
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,579
um

1099
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,900
it's it's unfortunate because I think

1100
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:23,099
some of the

1101
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:25,440
the oral histories around some of these

1102
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,880
plants is is fascinating and it's

1103
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,400
something that I'm trying to dive into

1104
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,980
in another podcast right now

1105
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,079
um unrelated I mean it's not scientific

1106
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,639
at all but I think the Stories Behind

1107
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,220
These plants is really interesting and I

1108
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:41,338
think that all gets lost

1109
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:43,318
as we move towards people you know just

1110
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:44,639
renaming things and everything just

1111
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:47,338
being jumbled and we don't really know

1112
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,078
what's what out there in the industry

1113
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:51,659
um unfortunately

1114
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:55,099
but that's a that's another issue

1115
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:55,098
but I don't think that we're gonna know

1116
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,779
on their genomes

1117
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,780
that create

1118
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,039
barcode or these phenotypic barcode

1119
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:07,559
right and and that's why I think that um

1120
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,420
testing facilities and reliable testing

1121
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,199
facilities are really important because

1122
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:16,619
you go there and you know that this has

1123
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:18,239
however much mercine and CBD and CBD

1124
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,440
enterpinoline and et cetera et cetera

1125
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,959
and then you can create kind of like

1126
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,000
this phenotypic barcode for your strain

1127
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,940
and then if you sequence it then you can

1128
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,280
create this genomic barcode for your

1129
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,159
strain right and I don't think that

1130
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,339
these names and you know so and so was

1131
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:37,500
in this concert in 1991 and blah blah

1132
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:38,818
blah and that's how this

1133
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,980
that's

1134
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:42,719
that's just an anecdote

1135
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,059
it's totally an active I just think it's

1136
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:48,059
uh some of the stories are interesting

1137
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,679
you know purely is anecdotal stories you

1138
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,539
know entertainment

1139
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,519
um but one thing you brought up was the

1140
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:56,699
labs and I think that's a whole nother

1141
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:58,619
issue is lab reliability I know in

1142
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:02,159
certain States as emerging States came

1143
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:05,039
into play the labs that gave the highest

1144
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,039
THC percentages were the ones that then

1145
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,239
survived and people would use because

1146
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,559
they you know the cultivators could

1147
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,299
market and sell their product for more

1148
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,940
or the labs that were passing people on

1149
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,640
heavy metals were the ones that didn't

1150
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,679
that people used because you know it's

1151
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,659
it so it becomes all economic at a

1152
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,159
certain point and I think that's where

1153
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:26,219
it becomes really hard to use any of

1154
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:28,259
that data for science because

1155
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:30,779
there is so much variability even on the

1156
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,700
lab side I would argue

1157
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,260
I agree and I disagree with what you

1158
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:35,879
just say I agree because I know that

1159
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,380
that happened

1160
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,838
and I can tell you

1161
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:43,800
which ones to go to in the boulder

1162
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,960
Denver area like I I know that right and

1163
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,960
however however

1164
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,880
uh this paper that I was talking about

1165
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,858
with the people from Leafly Nick Jacobus

1166
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,740
and and Christiana Smith

1167
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:56,880
so it's a paper that was actually

1168
00:46:54,739 --> 00:47:01,618
published this year

1169
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,660
between a yeah Christiana myself

1170
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,579
um Brian Keegan who's a professor at CU

1171
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:08,578
Boulder and he and I have this is our

1172
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:12,060
second paper together and uh nickomas

1173
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:14,818
saw the four of us and what we did is

1174
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:17,699
that we analyzed all of the strains from

1175
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:19,619
Leafly all of the chemotypes and we

1176
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:21,000
looked at cannabinoids we looked at

1177
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,740
terpenes we looked at correlations

1178
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,679
between cannabinos and terpenes between

1179
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:28,019
terpenes and then you know the names so

1180
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:31,098
so this is indica or this is sativa this

1181
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:33,119
is hybrid and we we did this beautiful

1182
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,980
statistical analysis and machine

1183
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,420
learning analysis and the figures are

1184
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,639
beautiful and I love the figures because

1185
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,500
I did the figures so and I hope that

1186
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,539
people like the figures because it took

1187
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,219
me a long time to do those figures to

1188
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:45,539
make him really pretty

1189
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:47,899
um so

1190
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:51,599
in the paper

1191
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,460
Leafly works with six different Labs

1192
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,740
across the U.S there's a lot in

1193
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:59,760
Washington state Oregon I think

1194
00:47:55,739 --> 00:48:02,338
California uh Florida Michigan so

1195
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,720
there's labs in multiple different parts

1196
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,838
of the US

1197
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,239
and something that we measured was how

1198
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:11,900
different the labs were and the labs

1199
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:14,519
were very consistent between them

1200
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,900
despite one of them being in Florida and

1201
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,300
the other one in Michigan and the other

1202
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,460
one in Washington state they were very

1203
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:24,200
consistent so I was and I was very

1204
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:28,079
positively surprised because

1205
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:30,838
despite the Cannabis industry being so

1206
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,019
differently regulated everywhere despite

1207
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:36,299
cannabis being still federally illegal

1208
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:38,159
you have these Labs that are very

1209
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,280
consistent and you have these people are

1210
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,019
doing wonderful jobs and

1211
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,700
you know like

1212
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:46,440
I like

1213
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:48,539
I want to congratulate these people

1214
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,559
because they don't know each other

1215
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:57,539
they and and they are

1216
00:48:51,559 --> 00:49:00,239
putting out very reliable results so but

1217
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:01,800
you still have those labs which as you

1218
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:04,078
just mentioned you know like so-and-so

1219
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,400
will spot your THC or so on so we'll you

1220
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,460
know we'll give you a pass on heavy

1221
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,380
metals you still have those so also I

1222
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,900
think that we should congratulate deeply

1223
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,519
because Leafly now knows they have

1224
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,039
really high standards and they're really

1225
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,199
good at betting who they're going to

1226
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:21,119
work with which was in a way my

1227
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,159
take-home message like Leafly knows who

1228
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,019
they're working with and legally knows

1229
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:27,779
consistent results

1230
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:29,759
so so there there are possibilities out

1231
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,200
there as well

1232
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,480
these weren't

1233
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,519
six randomized Labs then they were Labs

1234
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,940
that were vetted and are using the same

1235
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,800
Sops correct better by Leafly I don't

1236
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,420
know if they were using the same Sops I

1237
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,579
know that they did have different

1238
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,619
equipment I think you know like it's not

1239
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:48,420
like everyone had Agilent where everyone

1240
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:51,300
had shimatsu

1241
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,039
um no but they uh they were Labs that

1242
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,960
were vetted by Leafly and Leafly just

1243
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,779
chooses those labs in order to gather

1244
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,159
data their data yeah okay well that

1245
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,480
makes sense well you know I got to

1246
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:01,920
figure there's good Labs out there just

1247
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,380
like there's

1248
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,760
good cultivators that are following the

1249
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,280
rules and there's other ones that are

1250
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,200
you know spraying illegal pesticides or

1251
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,540
plant growth hormones or things that you

1252
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:14,159
know are not safe for humans so I just

1253
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:16,440
think that's human nature

1254
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,759
um I think Labs have potential but I

1255
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,519
think we have to acknowledge that

1256
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,680
there's challenges with lab testing as

1257
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:25,259
much as there is with genetics and

1258
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:27,059
diversity and everything else that's

1259
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,920
going on with trying to better

1260
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:31,199
understand this plant

1261
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,760
yeah yeah no that's true you know

1262
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,399
there's good restaurants and bad

1263
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,260
restaurants yeah

1264
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,818
wonderful well

1265
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,920
um was there anything else that you

1266
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:42,599
wanted to share regarding you know the

1267
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,039
research you've done or anything that

1268
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:48,539
you're really excited about in the

1269
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:51,179
upcoming year uh related to the industry

1270
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:54,558
so uh I don't know when

1271
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:54,558
this podcast is gonna be

1272
00:50:55,019 --> 00:51:00,900
I also worked on the

1273
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,899
varieties produced by the National

1274
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:09,300
Institute on drug abuse Nida

1275
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:11,519
um I have a paper on 2017 regarding the

1276
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:15,000
phenotype where we compare the

1277
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:17,280
cannabinoids of

1278
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,780
um varieties or of strains that you can

1279
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,460
find these dispensaries to those that

1280
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,780
are produced by Nida

1281
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:27,440
and then uh on 2021 we have the genome

1282
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,220
we looked at the genome from

1283
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,679
from

1284
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:35,699
um naida's varieties I'm gonna be giving

1285
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:37,019
a talk uh at the end of August regarding

1286
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:39,239
that

1287
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:41,659
um so the take-home message is that you

1288
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:45,118
know Nida varieties are not

1289
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:47,818
representative of what people are using

1290
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,619
um neither in the phenotype nor in the

1291
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:51,960
genotype right like varieties are

1292
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:54,900
different than because Nida has this

1293
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,940
Monopoly where they are the only ones

1294
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,579
that produce the Cannabis that is used

1295
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:01,500
for medicinal or

1296
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:05,220
or a research right medicinal research

1297
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:07,800
or or any sort of scientific research so

1298
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:11,159
um naida's varieties are different from

1299
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,960
everything that people actually consume

1300
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:18,779
um so I'm gonna be talking about that

1301
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,400
so if the plants that Knight is using to

1302
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,380
it are used for

1303
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,420
do they influence National policy or are

1304
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,358
they primarily just what they're

1305
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:31,260
supplying to the scientific community

1306
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:33,119
um so so it does influence policy how

1307
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,500
how does that work if they're plants

1308
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,240
that they have are so genetically

1309
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,940
different than what everyone else is

1310
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:41,459
consuming and using

1311
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,200
or is this just typical government uh

1312
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,358
bureaucracy

1313
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,358
I mean

1314
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:49,980
how could that be

1315
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:53,639
um

1316
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:55,858
how could how could that research be not

1317
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:58,980
biased right like how could you have

1318
00:52:55,858 --> 00:53:02,759
research that is reliable when you are

1319
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:05,159
producing the varieties for research and

1320
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,579
your weed is completely different from

1321
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:10,078
everyone else's right so how how is your

1322
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:13,140
research reliable what are those

1323
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,940
differences then out of curiosity

1324
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:18,139
um

1325
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:23,700
in respect to cannabinoids

1326
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:26,539
uh they have very little variation

1327
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:31,259
so the diversity of cannabinoids is much

1328
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:35,279
a less so less diverse and the amount of

1329
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:37,800
cannabinoids is less so it's less

1330
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,839
um THC less CBD

1331
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,079
more CBN

1332
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:46,739
more of the breakdown compounds so CVN

1333
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:49,380
is actually significantly more and then

1334
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:51,739
regarding the genome which was the the

1335
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,059
2021 paper

1336
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:56,039
they are different from everything else

1337
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,619
right it's like

1338
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:03,259
you know like they tell you

1339
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:06,660
um you can study dogs but you can only

1340
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:09,599
study Labradors forget about the

1341
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:12,358
chihuahuas or French poodles or right

1342
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:16,019
Great Danes you can only study this one

1343
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:17,400
thing that's it right so so it's

1344
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:20,219
completely different from what everyone

1345
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,760
else is consuming okay and what are the

1346
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:26,759
implications of uh really high CBN

1347
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:29,220
relative to what is on the market

1348
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,000
so CBN is a breakdown product right on

1349
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:35,338
CVN accumulates usually when you have a

1350
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,300
lot of heat when you leave your cannabis

1351
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:43,019
in um for a long time long periods of

1352
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,519
time it accumulates and um and then it's

1353
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:46,500
usually that cannabinoid that gives you

1354
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:48,358
the headaches

1355
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,880
um or usually that that it kind of like

1356
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:54,000
makes you drowsy

1357
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,760
um so that is the cannabinoid that

1358
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,039
um that night that has a lot of

1359
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,780
interest and it gets expressed you said

1360
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:05,699
from heat stress

1361
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:07,740
no so it's a breakdown product so THC

1362
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:09,419
um turns into CBN

1363
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:12,299
CBN it's actually

1364
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:15,659
um an oxidation process oh okay THC

1365
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,640
turns into CBN and uh

1366
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:18,779
um you know like something else that I

1367
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:20,338
think

1368
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,740
that is going on in the Cannabis

1369
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:25,019
industry at least in the

1370
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:28,519
yeah in the legal markets is that people

1371
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:31,800
really put a lot of effort in producing

1372
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:34,318
really good weed right and in marketing

1373
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,660
themselves as you know like mines are

1374
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,880
the stinkiest or yours are the prettiest

1375
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:40,500
or minds are the tallest or yours are

1376
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,838
purple right and it's this competition

1377
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,119
in making the best weed how am I gonna

1378
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:47,519
differentiate myself and my brand and

1379
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,079
and making the best weed and then you

1380
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,559
have Nida

1381
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:57,240
producing the cannabis for research

1382
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:59,819
which is not the best not diverse not

1383
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:03,000
potent with a lot of breakdown product

1384
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:04,139
like and that's what scientists have to

1385
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,300
study

1386
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:08,460
right so

1387
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,280
yeah I don't know a lot about the

1388
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:13,380
medical chemical side that's never just

1389
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,460
that hasn't been my area of Interest as

1390
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:17,700
much

1391
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,920
um do you see the CBN thing is

1392
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:20,879
interesting to me though so do you see

1393
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,980
that

1394
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,780
still existing in the General Market in

1395
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:27,119
just much lower levels

1396
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,460
a plant expression so like

1397
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,980
when I go to a dispensary for example

1398
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,720
I'm not going to necessarily when that

1399
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,920
plant gets oxidized I'm not going to get

1400
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:37,739
a headache because I'm not going to get

1401
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:41,220
as much the same levels of CBN that I

1402
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:44,000
would from a say a Nida plant

1403
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:44,000
however if you leave

1404
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,980
in your garage

1405
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,700
the entire summer and then you know come

1406
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:59,880
October you take the nug it's it's

1407
00:56:56,699 --> 00:57:04,739
likely that the THC would have converted

1408
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:06,838
into CBN oh okay

1409
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:07,979
I didn't I didn't know that that's like

1410
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:09,539
I said that's not something I've ever

1411
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,740
looked into so I'm sure there's a lot of

1412
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:12,900
listeners that know exactly what you're

1413
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:14,279
talking about right now so but hopefully

1414
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,960
there's some like me that are learning

1415
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,420
something right now and that's uh really

1416
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,199
interesting so thanks for sharing

1417
