1
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:10,000
okay now we're back with that African

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,000
compost Nightcrawler

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,678
compost this is with

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,719
Alfalfa we a 100 times magnification

5
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:23,800
here this is why I love Alfalfa it's a

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,278
great balanced food

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,960
source easy to use Easy to store here's

8
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:34,640
a little Pete Leaf than some of the

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,640
fungi may be feeding off of if we zoom

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
in you can see that the bacteria really

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,718
like it too when you compare this to the

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,120
control that we had

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,320
going on this compost where there really

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:58,919
didn't seem to be a lot going on just

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,920
giving them a food source it's a huge

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
difference

17
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,719
oh that's

18
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,839
a that's a good shot right there where

19
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,039
you get

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,560
the fungi and all that

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,560
bacteria that looks

22
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,959
great
