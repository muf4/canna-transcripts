welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,679
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,118
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

5

where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:29,719
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,359
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,640
indust hisory to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,920
knowledge my guest this week is Matthew

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,960
debacco Matthew received his bachelor's

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,120
degree in pathology with a secondary

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,960
degree in horiculture then went on to

13
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,519
receive a master's degree in Agronomy in

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,719
2011 and a master's in education in 2014

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,239
both from the University of Connecticut

16
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,000
then in 2020 he received his PhD from

17
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,558
Ashford University Matthew started the

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,878
first cannabis course at a public

19
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,799
university at the University of

20
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:59,558
Connecticut I first found out about

21
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,238
Matthew from his research on powder

22
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,959
mildew with curbit using raw milk as it

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,560
was circulating around the giant pumpkin

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,000
Community Matthew also enjoys growing

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,879
giant pumpkins and is held the state

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,478
record twice with the largest weighing

27
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,239
1,885 12 lbs in this episode we talk

28
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,920
about the similarities between the giant

29
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,599
pumpkin community and the Cannabis

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,359
community and how we might be able to

31
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,118
utilize some of the advancements across

32
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,478
the cultivation of these very different

33
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,640
plants now on to the show

34
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,679
right hey Matthew thank you so much for

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,478
coming on the show today

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,640
thank you for having me glad to be here

37
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,759
yeah I you know I've been a follower of

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,439
you and I've seen your name on

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,079
bigpumpkins.com for years I didn't and

40
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,078
this is on me I didn't realize you were

41
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:49,078
also producing content in the Cannabis

42
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,718
space as well uh so I'm so excited that

43
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,478
we were able to connect when I reached

44
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,919
out to you and I wanted to kind of hear

45
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,640
a little bit about your journey what

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,519
you're up to and then uh the topic you

47
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,159
suggested which is diving in about uh

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,599
the comparisons between giant pumpkin

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,280
growing and cannabis which I think is

50
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,359
going to be a fascinating topic but

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
let's just start off tell me a little

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,878
bit about yourself sure well uh so I

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,560
teach at the University of Connecticut

54
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,878
and as well as some other universities

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,120
but I developed the Cannabis course um

56
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:22,479
at the University of Connecticut so the

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,599
poit B were very receptive to offering a

58
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:28,759
new course uh TI in cannabis I like to

59
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,799
think looking at all the data think it's

60
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,159
the first public University to offer

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
such a course and this started back I

62
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,560
think

63
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,039
2019 is when it first came out of course

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,680
it took some prep to get to that point

65
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,519
um but that was the first time we were

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,599
able to to offer a intro to cannabis

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,719
course um at a public university so you

68
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,639
know it was lots of Applause and

69
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,280
excitement when we wield the plants into

70
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,039
the lecture room on that first day um so

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,598
that's always nice to see uh but before

72
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,598
I even got to that how I even got in

73
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,799
that that position I actually started

74
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,318
with giant pumpkins and I know cannabis

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,480
Growers and giant pumpkin Growers may

76
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,798
not seem like there's a lot of

77
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,919
similarities but there actually is so I

78
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,439
started hobby growing giant pumpkins uh

79
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,158
simply because I want to grow you know

80
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,120
biggest pumpkin possible shall we say

81
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,560
and this was uh or this I should say

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,959
currently it's my 24th year growing

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,519
giant pumpkin so it's been a little

84
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,080
while a lot of trial and error um early

85
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,680
ages of the internet early ages of

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,280
sharing information you know so a lot of

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,719
lot of Trials and a lot of errors

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,280
uh but what kind of LED that is I

89
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,239
enjoyed growing things so progressing

90
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,438
with the pumpkins and this was back when

91
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,039
I was in high school essentially able to

92
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,799
kind of choose my career path so

93
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,959
progressing on post High School to the

94
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,200
university I was looking at getting into

95
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,479
plant science and plant science of

96
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,839
course growing things you know but

97
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,280
there's many different subcategories

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,878
from there so from there I kind of

99
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,479
progressed or favored the pathology

100
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,438
study of diseases so I was in animal

101
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,119
science courses learning about diseases

102
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,840
and kind of relating them and Crossing

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,360
them over with plant science courses

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,239
that led then after graduating there uh

105
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,079
to go on to a master's degree in

106
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,120
Agronomy which is a study of growing

107
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,120
field crops and not necessarily focusing

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,319
on uh nutrient per se but looking more

109
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,199
at the pathology looking more at the

110
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:27,040
diseases that impact uh economic crops

111
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,360
and I did a focus on tomatoes as well as

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
cucurbits which is of course your

113
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,560
pumpkins and your squash and if you've

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,280
ever grown a pumpkin or a squash pretty

115
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,680
much they get white stuff on the leaves

116
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,719
and it's powdery mildew so I was looking

117
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,038
at trying to organically suppress

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,560
powdery mildew because it's such a broad

119
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:45,279
uh disease and any was gr cannabis as

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,918
well knows powdery mildew is very common

121
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,918
on cannabis so since this was early on

122
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:53,918
in the legalization of things across the

123
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:57,038
United States my research paper my

124
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,319
thesis came up quite a bit and I started

125
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:00,519
uh being called in by indoor cannabis

126
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,639
facility

127
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,959
what made it difficult was becoming from

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,680
the giant pumpkin or the field world

129
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,478
into an indoor world is when all the

130
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,120
control and all the different parameters

131
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,918
that an indoor facility has but all the

132
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,399
plants that I saw cannabis plants to

133
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,918
start off were all sick uh I never went

134
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,879
to A Healthy Grow because I was quote

135
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,079
the the Plant Doctor the plant vet you

136
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,038
know see this plant see the Tomato see a

137
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,719
eggplant see a pepper see a canvas plant

138
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,079
um so I was approaching it from the

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,840
disease aspect and offered a couple

140
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,680
suggestions early on that happened to

141
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,599
hit really well and as a result I kept

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,280
getting called back and one word of

143
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
mouth spread to another person spread to

144
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,119
another person and then um ultimately

145
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,519
ended up uh developing the course I was

146
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,639
offered to develop the course and went

147
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,478
that route and kind of now living the uh

148
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,840
double life of the Cannabis production

149
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,680
in the Cannabis Grove indoor facilities

150
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,198
as well as the outdoor production

151
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
through the extension service that we

152
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,120
have here in the state as well as the

153
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,560
hobbyist Growers uh for giant pumpkins

154
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,000
so that was kind of a long kind of

155
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,199
rendition there of about 20ish 24ish or

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,120
so years uh but that's kind of what led

157
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,000
me to where in

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,720
today and going back to the course at

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,759
Connecticut who is that course really

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,759
directed for is it an in-person course

161
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,038
can you take it online can you just I'm

162
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,038
sure people will have a few questions

163
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,519
about that so um if you research I think

164
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,800
it's hemp production University of

165
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,680
Connecticut type that into a search

166
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,240
engine probably find something about it

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,478
there's basically two modalities during

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,720
the typical College semester which

169
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,240
starts up end of this month uh August uh

170
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,280
from August

171
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,199
to December January or so I think

172
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,559
December should know I semesters during

173
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,400
the fall semester that is the

174
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,720
introduction to cannabis course so

175
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:53,879
that's like the basics um of how to grow

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,599
how to produce it's directed at um new

177
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,120
Growers people who don't have any

178
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,959
interest in growing uh I have some

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,079
business majors that take it some uh

180
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,719
Pharmacy that take it just want to know

181
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,560
about the plant though the plant science

182
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
Majors do still learn something about it

183
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,038
because they get to work with the plants

184
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,759
during the fall semester that then leads

185
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,240
to the spring semester which occurs

186
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,240
right around January time frame and that

187
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,960
is the advanced course which is assuming

188
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,000
you pass the intro course you progress

189
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,598
onto the advanced course and we get to

190
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,639
more the details you know we're still

191
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,319
able to grow the plant where in the

192
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,360
intro course I handle all the phing and

193
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,800
all the watering and all of that um the

194
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,199
advantage or the Advanced course the

195
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,879
advantages the students have passed the

196
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,120
intro course and it's kind of on the

197
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,120
students responsibility to keep the

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,160
plants alive on there res there

199
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,840
consultant and I direct them of course

200
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,439
as we go through the semester but

201
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,000
they've got to decide when to flip it

202
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,680
the flour decide when to do a water

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
change decide what nutrients to add what

204
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,639
PH to run them at and all those

205
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
decisions now that's for those that can

206
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,400
be there at the University of

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,918
Connecticut and stores in person during

208
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,519
the fall and spring semester however I

209
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,120
run the same courses during summer

210
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,878
session one and summer session two

211
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,598
uh and those are completely remote and

212
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,919
online so those can be taken by anyone

213
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:10,079
in any state really anywhere um in the

214
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,680
world technically uh because it's the

215
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,639
same basic content you don't get to work

216
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,840
with the plants because of the

217
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,720
limitations of being online but you kind

218
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,000
of get the same experience I kind of try

219
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,639
to do some discussion board postings the

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,240
same information the same content that I

221
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,720
pull from of course with the students

222
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,639
experience in the semester to try to

223
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,960
bring that experience as best I can

224
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,000
across all the different states and

225
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,519
rules and

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,399
regulations so they can get a similar

227
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,599
experience without necessarily actually

228
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,759
touching and feeling the plant so online

229
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,800
in the summer session one and two Inon

230
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:45,480
Advance which is in the May to August

231
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,359
time frame and then iners uh at the

232
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,560
physical location of stores Connecticut

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,480
in the August to early uh end of April

234
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,799
early May time

235
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,079
frame that's great and then you also

236
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,719
have uh a YouTube channel with an

237
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:01,639
extensive

238
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,160
collection of videos I'm looking at it

239
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,240
right now you have over 100,000

240
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,519
subscribers which is incredible and just

241
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,000
broke that just got my silver play

242
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,440
button actually so that was a exciting

243
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,240
Monument congratul well deserved and you

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,640
have over 1,200 videos that you've

245
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,639
published on there uh many of many of

246
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,679
which are part of the course itself so

247
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,838
so that is an option for people as well

248
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,879
can you talk a little about that yeah so

249
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,959
uh debacco University is a YouTube

250
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,879
channel um it's broken into large

251
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,599
playlists so there's kind of like the

252
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,919
intro to cannabis one there's the

253
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,519
advanced cannabis um I've also got

254
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,559
agriculture because I also deal with

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,879
some Growers and Farmers on the large

256
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,639
scale I also have a biology uh subset

257
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,600
and a forensic science uh playlist on

258
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,799
there I have a student Series where some

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,240
of my students um have been able to do

260
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,479
some independent study work with

261
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,560
cannabis so I've tried to highlight some

262
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,639
of uh their work uh actually both

263
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,559
working in the Cannabis industry now

264
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,439
they've since graduated uh but kind of

265
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,838
trying to give them a little start there

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,000
but the goal of the channel there is

267
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,760
really to provide the um scientific

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,720
based information scientific back

269
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,240
information where we can now of course

270
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,200
we always want to have it more detail

271
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,079
and we always want to know all the

272
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,560
answers to everything uh there of course

273
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,719
are limitations to that but with the

274
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:20,119
Advent of the relaxation of some of the

275
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,800
some of the restrictions on cannabis

276
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,959
there's a lot more research coming out

277
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:27,879
specifically on cannabis so I am uh not

278
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,799
only Incorporated a lot of the content

279
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,799
into my intro in advance dance course

280
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,120
which you can find maybe not in a super

281
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,639
organized way but if you search the

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
channel you'll probably find a topic

283
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,919
that's of interest to you and I'm also

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,560
now diving into more scientific papers

285
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,799
as more research becomes available so I

286
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,199
do a lot of reading of scientific papers

287
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,838
some I like better than others so if I

288
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,519
feel that there's a quality resource

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,200
that is published and again these take

290
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,360
years of data and many scientists

291
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,120
usually working on them um but they can

292
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
be very intimidating to read very

293
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,720
difficult to read it takes a different

294
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,200
kind of mindset um sometimes to read

295
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,480
through them so on my channel some of

296
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,440
the more recent videos I read through

297
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,360
them and I kind of give the grower

298
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,680
synopsis so the grower summary for those

299
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,240
um hardcore scientific information I

300
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,319
always link to the original article so

301
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,879
if you want to dive into more of the

302
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,440
details or have some specifics about

303
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,600
materials or methods or something they

304
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,600
specifically did of course you can find

305
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,480
that but I try to hopefully give you

306
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,360
this little summary of what the

307
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,159
researchers found and how that can

308
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,000
relate to your own uh plants how your

309
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,199
own growing and try to really utilize

310
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,200
that scientific based information to

311
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,600
make sure you have an efficient grow and

312
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,959
something that's based on actual

313
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
information not here say whereas a lot

314
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,559
of people say on the channel the Bro

315
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,838
Science if you will yes yes oh that's

316
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,799
wonderful well let's let's dive in now

317
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,959
with a little bit of the content so one

318
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,039
of the things that Growers may not be as

319
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:59,319
familiar with is the giant pumpkin world

320
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:01,000
so I actually so I was working with my

321
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,278
my father started this compost tea

322
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,200
company and so I started looking on this

323
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,439
was infancy of online forums and things

324
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,959
like that as well at the time and so I

325
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,880
started looking for places people were

326
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,799
talking about compost tea and the two

327
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,159
places I found was um an internet

328
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,759
cannabis Forum

329
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,319
icmag.com uh and then bigpumpkins.com

330
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,919
I'm still actually on both of those

331
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,040
websites and the similarities between

332
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,399
the two groups is really quite

333
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:32,399
fascinating and and at the time and

334
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,958
let's let's give them a little bit of

335
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,480
history about the giant pumpkin world so

336
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,039
at the time when I joined we were

337
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,800
talking about breaking the

338
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,838
1,000lb barrier I believe so this kind

339
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:47,078
of gives you an idea of what what year

340
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,360
it was or around the time um and that

341
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,000
was that was the Big Bear they're like

342
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,560
are we going to get there you know and

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,839
then what that's going to look like um I

344
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:59,479
know the current world record what are

345
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,680
we at now is it is it over 2500 lb yep 2

346
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,959
what is

347
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,239
2749 I believe oh my gosh that's amazing

348
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,198
might be even5 I don't know it's 49.5

349
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,039
but 2700 plus

350
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:15,919
yeah um so the passion and this is going

351
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:18,198
from seed to fruit in one season so you

352
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,879
literally you literally get to see it

353
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:24,278
grow um what were some of the

354
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,278
breakthroughs um besides obviously

355
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,240
genetics improving over the years so a

356
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,879
lot of it was breeding I think that

357
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,879
contributed to these growth but what

358
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,078
were some of the

359
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,919
cultivation you know changes that were

360
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,679
made that really allowed people to hit

361
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:42,240
that next stage of of growth the next

362
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,879
level so what's really helped um just in

363
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,839
general is just the sharing of

364
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:50,278
information I find that um very common

365
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,759
in the giant pumpkin world you know I'll

366
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,958
have people we do patch tours where

367
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,919
literally in this summer we go out and

368
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,679
we see three four people's different

369
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,278
patches they invite a bunch of growers

370
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,399
in they show them what they're doing and

371
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,000
it's always nice to see the comparison

372
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,000
of how different people handle different

373
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,919
challenges you know being in Southern

374
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,198
New England you know I'll travel up to

375
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,759
Vermont or Massachusetts or New

376
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,599
Hampshire or Rhode Island or even in

377
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,919
Connecticut here just having that you

378
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,360
know camar and that kind of sharing of

379
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,159
information because despite being you

380
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,879
know out here you know East Coast

381
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,319
particularly in New England other small

382
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,159
states um so you don't have to travel

383
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,399
very far across the state border but we

384
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,600
have a lot of different soil types in

385
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,399
this region a lot of Glacier moves to a

386
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,159
lot of things a lot of river systems so

387
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,839
there's a lot of variability in even a

388
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,639
very small Geographic um area so it's

389
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,519
seeing how people basically dealt with

390
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,879
those problems uh being able to share

391
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,078
information to see you know oh what are

392
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,958
you running your pH at what is your

393
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,638
nutrient levels um at what are your

394
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,039
target levels great here I got a soil

395
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
test well what does that really mean um

396
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,439
and having that really sharing of

397
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,879
information has really been a big uh leg

398
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,720
up um and really keeping a lot of the

399
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,720
basics kind of in control you know

400
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,399
knowing how much water to give them a

401
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,680
lot of Growers start off by not giving

402
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,759
them too much water and then they might

403
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,000
flip to giving them too much water so

404
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,959
it's finding that kind of um happy

405
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
medium and what's really allowed it I

406
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,838
think to progress to the the level that

407
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,600
we're at is the true blending of the

408
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
science information with the plant

409
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,879
growing information you know you'll find

410
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,160
Cannabis Growers alike and giant pumpkin

411
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,120
Growers as well that there is uh they do

412
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,600
a lot of uh scientific reading a lot of

413
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,759
lot of information you know not just

414
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,240
sticking a seat in the ground watching

415
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,120
it grow that's how you might start and

416
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,278
that's a great way to start but then

417
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,799
it's always trying to beat your personal

418
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,198
best yes maybe you want to set a state

419
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,399
record or a world record or something

420
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,958
like that but really the challenge is to

421
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,919
to beat yourself um figure out whatever

422
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,758
you grew the biggest and what can you

423
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,078
beat that you know and what can you do

424
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,560
and what what improvements can you make

425
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,519
what efficiencies can you know you

426
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:01,719
tolerate and of of course the weather is

427
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,560
the great variable so you'll notice uh

428
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,360
particular giant pumpkins because uh

429
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,679
they're growing pretty much outdoors in

430
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,240
Sun uh there'll be different Pockets or

431
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,000
regions that typically have better

432
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
success than than others just in general

433
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,559
you'll always get the one standout which

434
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,278
is always nice to see but for the most

435
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,879
part weather does have an impact uh but

436
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,439
really what's allowed us to go from a

437
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:26,198
th000 pounds to now 2,000 plus pounds is

438
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,920
that sharing of information and that uh

439
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:31,439
utilizing of that scientific information

440
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,439
to really drive and make decisions a lot

441
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,720
of Growers are going to soil moisture

442
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,680
meters for example knowing what's

443
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,879
actually in the plant um for indoor

444
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,399
Growers you know VPD vapor pressure

445
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,399
deficit is a big thing well just having

446
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,720
an idea of even Outdoors we can kind of

447
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,480
increase the humidity we really can't

448
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,920
reduce it but we can increase it so at

449
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,079
what point uh do plants maybe like a

450
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,799
little bit more humidity how does that

451
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,318
change when the plant is small versus

452
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,879
when the plant is larger how does that

453
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,000
change in the early season versus the

454
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,879
late season um and having Growers that

455
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,359
get success and really willing to share

456
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,838
information you know I was at or been at

457
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,599
you know we've been fortunate in this

458
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,000
region to have uh different Growers set

459
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,599
new world records and we've always been

460
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,160
very inviting always you know willing to

461
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,918
share the information that they did um

462
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,439
we've got other Growers that you know

463
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,120
are growing over even in Europe one just

464
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,679
did a podcast they've got some great

465
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,599
ones growing right now they've got

466
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,559
several over 2,000 pounds by the

467
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,918
measurements so that's by the estimation

468
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,759
weights um and and you know you could

469
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,960
type questions into it they were you

470
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,240
know they were um telling you what they

471
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,400
did um of course specific to their

472
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,519
conditions because they're growing in a

473
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,798
greenhouse uh but they'll tell you what

474
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,960
they're doing they'll they'll tell you

475
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,400
you know what Target levels they're

476
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,558
shooting for so it just gives people a

477
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,320
little bit wider uh appreciation for the

478
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:51,000
plant and a little bit wider uh

479
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,918
information birth to kind of have that

480
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,839
idea of oh someone did this let me maybe

481
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,280
try that or me look more into that maybe

482
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm missing something on that aspect and

483
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,079
then of course genetics and breeding

484
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,679
tracking those genetics you know we can

485
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:09,000
track them back into the probably the

486
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,600
mid to early 90s um for most pumpkins at

487
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,798
that point now we're going so many

488
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,519
generations back it probably doesn't

489
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,519
make that much of a difference but

490
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,519
Crossing pollinations making those

491
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,319
crosses um finding out what seeds are

492
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,359
tendency produce more orange pumpkins

493
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,519
heavier pumpkins things like that and

494
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,519
it's the same thing in the Cannabis

495
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,119
industry it's that genetics now we're

496
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,119
not as apt to clone giant pumpkins I

497
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,599
have did some of that research when we

498
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,639
were getting the first 2000 pounder I

499
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:36,199
actually took a sample of the plant that

500
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,440
grew the first 2000 pounder grew in a

501
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,640
greenhouse over the winter and use that

502
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,840
to kind of crossbreed into a couple

503
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,799
things so that's probably more of my

504
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:48,119
more famous pumpkins even though only

505
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,000
weighed 220 pounds um it's had it went

506
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:53,439
on that following year to produce two

507
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,359
pumpkins in the top 10 um world um

508
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,759
weights the following year and that was

509
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,279
just showed the power of genetics that

510
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,440
it came from very unique genetics and

511
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,200
yes it was only a 220b pumpkin it had

512
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,960
the genetics of world records and um it

513
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,798
really went on to produce more of the

514
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,679
whiter pumpkins I called it snowball um

515
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,759
because that's what it looked like it

516
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,400
was grown in the winter um as giant

517
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,960
pumpkin Growers we try to do everything

518
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,559
we can in the summertime to cool our

519
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,319
pumpkins so I think it's the first ever

520
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,399
pumpkin Little Flower that was cooled

521
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,000
with uh packs of snow around it because

522
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,679
Lally I went outside the greenhouse we

523
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,640
had big snowstorm I packed snow around

524
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,600
it to keep that area cool to help

525
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,200
increase the odds of pollination and um

526
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,759
it set and uh worked out quite well and

527
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,919
ended up with a 200 lb pumpkin that was

528
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,079
hard to get out the door believe or not

529
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,159
in the greenhouse so I had to work it

530
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,599
through the door and got some seeds sent

531
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,320
them to different Growers and they were

532
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,959
able to grow them that year so y x play

533
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,918
a role sharing of information and really

534
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,798
just getting a bigger population or data

535
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,159
set to figure out what really is ideal

536
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,639
for these

537
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,520
pumpkins yeah I have a I had a slightly

538
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,640
different uh experience perspective and

539
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,759
I totally agree with you on the sharing

540
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,440
information um correct and correct me if

541
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,879
anything is wrong here in terms of my

542
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,480
recollection of it or how I perceived it

543
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,520
um but it seemed to me when I first

544
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,558
started experiencing the giant pumpkin

545
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:17,639
Community um a lot of what was going on

546
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,158
was it was a lot of like chemical

547
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,919
growing um primarily and and a lot of

548
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,640
experimentation people were willing to

549
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,520
try just about anything if someone did

550
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,840
it and and they're called like uh Heavy

551
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,119
Hitters is the term in the giant pumpkin

552
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,439
Community if you grow at the time over

553
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,839
and they keep raising the bar of what

554
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,360
that is it might be 800 lb 1,000 lb500

555
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,359
2,000 and uh there's a special jacket

556
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,839
that you can win um it's a whole it's a

557
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,279
whole thing these people are so

558
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,319
passionate I mean can you imagine

559
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,119
dedicating an entire

560
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:51,000
Greenhouse literally for growing one or

561
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,119
two pumpkins it's incredible so um these

562
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,599
these people are very passionate they're

563
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,759
very smart um and they care deeply about

564
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,719
what they grow but what I what I found

565
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,640
initially was it was aot lot of uh

566
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,798
chemical growing and then people started

567
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,120
incorporating back in you know someone

568
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,480
heard about micro isal fungi for example

569
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,158
and people started incorporating some

570
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,960
Organics back into it looking at um

571
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,320
adding organic matter high quality

572
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,640
compost and it's sort of this

573
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:22,359
hybridization of Organics and synthetics

574
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,159
that has allowed uh you know larger

575
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,959
larger yields I guess in a sense if we

576
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,278
want to compare it with cannabis um

577
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,720
let's talk about that for a second add a

578
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:32,558
few other uh you know things I knows but

579
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,679
what what do you think about that so it

580
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,079
comes down to the um the timing of

581
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,559
application I think this is true for

582
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,759
cannabis as well as giant pumpkins early

583
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,519
on chemicals were you know the quote

584
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,119
unquote Miracle Grow blend was great

585
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,918
because you add it and the next day your

586
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,719
plants are super green and super tall

587
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,000
and super big and that's what we need

588
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,640
big aggressive green plants and it's uh

589
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,159
We've now kind of shifted a little bit

590
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,480
away from that I would say and utilizing

591
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,559
that more when the soil is cold when the

592
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
microbes just can't quite man

593
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,038
manufacture as much nitrogen or make as

594
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,720
many nutrients as available as the plant

595
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:08,200
needs so a little chemical early on and

596
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,360
then um if needed and then really

597
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,240
relying on organic matter now the old

598
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,879
school of thought was you know the idea

599
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,278
would be a 4 foot deep raised bed of

600
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,039
just all the compost that you could get

601
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:24,119
uh We've shifted away from that because

602
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,798
too much of a good thing is not a good

603
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,079
thing um that brought about a lot of

604
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,480
disease issues that brought about a lot

605
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,678
of water retention issues that we can't

606
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,640
quote get rid of that brought a lot of

607
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,840
nitrogen which um for giant pumpkins can

608
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,038
make the leaves really tall and big

609
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,599
which looks really impressive on you

610
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:43,158
know an Instagram post but really

611
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,519
doesn't do a lot of good for the plant

612
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,000
makes it very brittle and CH scows have

613
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,158
the same thing you know if you over add

614
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,759
nitrogen and you walk by a plant and the

615
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,159
branches usually just break they don't

616
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,359
have that nice kind of gives sort of

617
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,679
speak to them um so seeing it shift

618
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:00,359
towards more chemicals when needed in

619
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,798
small doses early on to kind of get the

620
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:06,479
plant initially going and then utilizing

621
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:09,480
um the soil because most are grown in

622
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,558
some sort of um soil base now that could

623
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,919
be higher clay higher sand higher silt

624
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,558
again depending on the region in the

625
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,840
area but usually amended of course with

626
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,879
some organic matter now the ideal Target

627
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,599
depending on who you talk to everyone

628
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
will give you a different number you

629
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,959
know looking at I'd say a minimum of

630
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,600
like five six 7% um up to 10 to 12 would

631
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,679
kind of be the theoretical range if you

632
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,079
will um but some Growers have 20% and

633
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,480
it's a little harder to grow in that

634
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,278
more consistently because it just holds

635
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,798
so much more water and you can get a lot

636
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:44,400
of nitrogen bloat just when the heat

637
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:46,440
comes in uh in the summertime so

638
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,159
utilizing those Organics to kind of keep

639
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,798
the plant going um shifting now almost

640
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,600
not away from chemical fertilizers but

641
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,000
really shifting away from the quantity

642
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,719
of chemical fertilizers you know giant

643
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,240
pumpkin th000 pounds we'll just say it

644
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,159
doesn't need a th000 pounds of

645
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,359
fertilizer um it needs a couple key

646
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,480
things at Key moments and how a lot of

647
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,439
the giant pumpkin Growers will um assess

648
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,079
this is through tissue testing where

649
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,080
they'll actually take a sample of the

650
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:16,399
leaf the pedol in particularly send that

651
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,278
off and kind of get an idea of what's

652
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,679
actually in the plant and of course

653
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:22,159
correlate that with their with their

654
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,840
soil testing and after you do it for a

655
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,960
couple years you'll kind of learn that

656
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,000
definitely giant pumpkins pull a lot of

657
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,759
potassium out of the soil so that's one

658
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,119
key thing that you need uh for cannabis

659
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,879
and pumpkins they do not need as much

660
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,398
phosphorus as so many Growers think that

661
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,919
they need um we had a little bit of an

662
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:42,719
issue in the giant pumpkin Community I

663
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,960
would say early on where we had a couple

664
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,440
Growers have great success um so

665
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,720
everyone gravitated to their soil test

666
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,120
like oh let's see your soil test let's

667
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,120
see your tissue test and they had very

668
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,199
high phosphorus now the issue with that

669
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,119
from the scientific standpoint was yes

670
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,319
they had big pumpkins now arguing with

671
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,000
that um but they had done that through

672
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,759
organic matter additions mainly

673
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,240
manure-based and they had brought their

674
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,919
phosphorus really high well what the

675
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,640
issue was that people were correlating

676
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,679
if they have a giant pumpkin and this is

677
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,278
their soil test this is what I need and

678
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,679
that really wasn't the case yes the

679
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,079
potassium maybe have been higher and

680
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,120
that was a good thing and some other

681
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,519
aspects and ratios and balances were

682
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,278
good but their phosphorus what Growers

683
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,480
didn't realize and cannabis Growers I

684
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:31,000
still kind of try to convey this to to

685
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,759
people is they think that they need this

686
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,679
high phospherous level and you really

687
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,919
don't it's really hard concept to get

688
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,679
across to people that have been told for

689
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,240
years and years phosphorus makes roots

690
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,880
and that's what you need and it helps

691
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,798
with the flowering that's your Bloom

692
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,559
fertilizers that's what you you need

693
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,720
high phosphorus high phosphorus high

694
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:52,960
phosphorus um and that's really just not

695
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,399
the case um back oh I don't remember the

696
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,640
exact year but when I grew the state

697
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:59,678
record uh here in Connecticut and that

698
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,600
was the time many years ago but it was

699
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,000
only 1300 pounds compared to today's

700
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,879
standards but my phosphorus levels was

701
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,278
almost nothing it was a I think it was

702
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,720
around four to 20 depending on when you

703
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:15,798
took the sample uh basically pounds per

704
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,038
the acre um and I've got Growers that

705
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:20,720
are growing 10 times that and more than

706
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,519
that um because they think they need

707
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,079
high phosphorus to get that growth and

708
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,558
you you really don't but it's always

709
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,038
hard to run that control when it's like

710
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,879
oh I'm not going to not add phosphorus

711
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:32,000
because that grower added phosphorus and

712
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,960
theirs was really tall and those grew a

713
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,038
really big pumpkin it's just the plants

714
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,360
just can't utilize it as much as as

715
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:40,679
Growers think so that's where again

716
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:43,639
where in the Cannabis World got a lot of

717
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,600
Growers add bone meal which is a great

718
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,840
you know source of phosphorus it is it's

719
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,240
a waste product from the slaughter

720
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,398
industry so blood meal and bone meal

721
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,640
great things to be able to utilize but

722
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:55,479
if you're using it in an Autoflower or

723
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,120
you're using in a very quick cycle

724
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,798
turnaround time for cannabis in

725
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,359
particular you're probably not getting

726
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,558
as much phosphorus as you added it takes

727
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,599
a little while to break that down better

728
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,158
for a living soil better for a longer

729
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:08,519
term grow operation but we've got a lot

730
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,880
of Growers that are adding it and yes it

731
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,639
is phosphorous but you've got to look at

732
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,559
plant available and um if you're doing a

733
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,640
really quick turnaround and dumping the

734
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,519
soil or throwing that out you might be

735
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,960
wasting some of your money there where

736
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,480
if you put it into a compost and kind of

737
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,720
get it to break down and then supplement

738
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
with the compost and or worm castings to

739
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,759
kind of help buffer and keep the

740
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,079
Organics there as a stable source course

741
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,679
that would probably be a better

742
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,398
utilization could be getting a higher

743
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,399
percentage of that so it's kind of the

744
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,678
education of Growers and I always love

745
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:42,079
the uh the bloom based fertilizers that

746
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,399
are like 45 to 50% phosphorus um it's

747
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,960
crazy how concentrated some chemical

748
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,479
fertilizers are that are out there that

749
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,278
people and Growers are utilizing uh

750
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,440
pretty extensively and really they just

751
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,919
don't have to um cannabis as well it's

752
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,080
the research I'm seeing shows a little

753
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,880
bit more of a potassium um need than say

754
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:04,759
a high high phosphorus um need so still

755
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,559
wait on some more of the research more

756
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,278
of the scientific literature to come out

757
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,200
on that but it's trending definitely in

758
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:14,359
that direction and I don't have any

759
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,798
major harm of uh less phosphorus being

760
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,599
added um and really it's a freshwater

761
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,720
ground uh water contaminant so it's got

762
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,839
environmental aspect we're importing

763
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,519
more phospherous it's a limited resource

764
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,798
so there's a whole bunch of other

765
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,278
aspects to consider more than just your

766
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:32,158
plant in your

767
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:33,880
nutrients that yeah that's a great Point

768
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,880
around phosphorus and we do see like

769
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,200
when we do a complete soil test um

770
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,000
sometimes we'll see varying levels of uh

771
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,159
phosphorus on the mic test acid

772
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,798
extraction but then and then we go to a

773
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,559
saturated Pace test and a water

774
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:52,319
extraction and that

775
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,519
availability in some cases can be quite

776
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,439
low I think we Target off top my head

777
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:01,000
around 2 PPM and sometimes we're at 08

778
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,640
and yet we still have very healthy happy

779
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,240
plants in an organic system um we do on

780
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,640
occasion will need to supplement

781
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,200
phosphorus and when we do that's that if

782
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,919
we want something faster acting that's

783
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,798
typically something like uh fish hydrate

784
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,278
because that allows us to get phosphoric

785
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:22,759
acid in there in an or in a no NOP

786
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,558
approved format um but I do agree

787
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,879
especially outdoors in soil because most

788
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:30,158
of the grows we work with are indoors no

789
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:33,320
runoff um so that phosphate is not going

790
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,559
anywhere but I do agree that yeah

791
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:38,439
especially Outdoors we really need to

792
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:39,879
limit and control our phosphorus use for

793
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,240
just from an environmental perspective

794
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,519
we don't sure or once you get it to a

795
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,159
level you don't have to keep adding it

796
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,558
everyone thinks I added a pound this

797
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,159
year I add a pound next year and the

798
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:50,200
pound the year after pound there's a

799
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,919
certain it levels off at a certain point

800
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,120
um and yes I would say more so Rocky

801
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,120
Mountain is um area probably would need

802
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:00,278
would benefit from some initial doses of

803
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,798
phosphorus but you don't have to keep

804
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:03,798
adding it every year which I think is

805
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:05,398
the mentality that well I added this and

806
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,480
I had success I have to keep adding this

807
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,719
to have the same success and it doesn't

808
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,159
quite work that

809
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,640
way I I also find phosphorous sources

810
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:15,880
tend to bring in heavy metals which is

811
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,640
not really a pumpkin concern so much as

812
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,120
a cannabis concern so uh just being

813
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,038
aware of how you can limit that will

814
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,398
also help because what's essentially

815
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,839
happening a lot of it locally locally

816
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,558
being United States comes out of Florida

817
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,359
and um the reason why we're importing

818
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,240
more and more phosphorus is we still

819
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,759
have a lot of phosphorus in Florida but

820
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,480
the Purity is going down meaning as

821
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,679
you're getting deeper and deeper into

822
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,319
the phosphorous mines they're getting

823
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,480
more containant more potential for heavy

824
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,519
metals it's still phosphorous but they

825
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,240
it's cheaper right now at least to

826
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:50,000
import in phosphorus than to refine it

827
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,240
and to take out some of those impurities

828
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,480
with the phosphorus Minds that they're

829
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,638
currently going through yeah it's

830
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,278
interesting I mean bone meal is actually

831
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:00,398
a very clean source of of fos now I

832
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:02,638
think about it and and fishbone usually

833
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,278
is too but um yeah when we talk about

834
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,599
things like soft rock phosphate yeah uh

835
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,319
yeah we are absolutely getting heavy

836
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,359
metals and other contaminants in there

837
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,839
too so that's a good point um well

838
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,000
getting back to this comparison between

839
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:20,558
giant

840
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,278
pumpkins uh and and cannabis um I I do

841
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,079
agree with you the collaboration in the

842
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:26,480
giant pumpkin Community is is phenomenal

843
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:28,398
uh it's it's on a whole another level

844
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,759
even beyond what we see in in in

845
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:34,199
cannabis I think because it's always

846
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:37,480
been been legal so people can talk about

847
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,880
it um what what have you found I mean

848
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,919
you talked a little bit about some of

849
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,278
this idea of what people call Bro

850
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,759
Science what were some of the things

851
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,480
that happened in the giant pumpkin

852
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:48,558
community that would be similar to that

853
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,240
Bro Science like just off the top of my

854
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,480
head with cannabis you know back in the

855
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,759
day people said if you apply Kool-Aid

856
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,599
your buds will be sweeter we know that

857
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,558
is not the case uh what are some of

858
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,918
those sorts of things that have worked

859
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,599
their way through the giant pumpkin

860
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,720
community over the years I would say

861
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:09,038
just the the trend and it continues to

862
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,399
be just the lack of let say lack of

863
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:16,720
nutrients but the reduction in volume of

864
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:19,398
nutrients the reduction in growing a

865
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,159
monster looking plant now these plants

866
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:22,079
get bigs I don't want it to you know

867
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,039
think that they were keeping these

868
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,359
really teeny tiny plants um but we don't

869
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:31,240
need or we I don't really want to see

870
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:33,079
leaves are 3 foot wide and 3ot tall you

871
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,599
over add nitrogen yes you will get a

872
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:38,439
giant leaf and it will look huge um but

873
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,638
it will typically speed age and people

874
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,240
were associating giant plants with giant

875
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:44,079
pumpkins and giant everything everything

876
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,159
should be bigger you know it's not gonna

877
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,278
be a field pumpkin it's going to be a

878
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,039
giant pumpkin and um we noticed again

879
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:53,798
through sharing information that come

880
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,278
June July yes the plants looked

881
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:57,960
ginormous the plants looked huge they

882
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:00,319
were getting their pumpkins set they

883
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,679
pumpkins were looking good uh but a lot

884
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,638
of times if if you were went back to

885
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,200
those plate patches now the end of

886
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:09,158
August they had a lot of Browning to

887
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,759
their leaves they had a lot more disease

888
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:15,519
potential they seem to tail in their

889
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:18,319
growth a lot quicker um then say a

890
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,480
weaker looking and that's in quotes a

891
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,200
weaker looking plant that was just I

892
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,440
call it the right color green the right

893
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,240
height not overly pushed in those

894
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,159
regards um so that's kind of been one

895
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,240
aspect there and that's been proven out

896
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,080
actually through giant pum Growers

897
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,159
themselves where you know I grow a plant

898
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:41,798
that's approximately 32 feet wide by 35

899
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:44,720
to 40 feet long that's one plant so

900
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:47,519
that's about a, to 1,200 square feet is

901
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,038
one plant now a lot of Growers don't

902
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,880
have that space but they still want to

903
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,278
try to grow a giant pumpkin so there's a

904
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,919
a contest out there that's been running

905
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,278
now for probably seven years it's called

906
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,159
the 150 square foot contest and what

907
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,839
this concept is and it's a really great

908
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,480
concept um you're allowed 150 square

909
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,358
feet to grow your pumpkin and your

910
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,119
pumpkin plant that's it everything's got

911
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:13,279
to fit in there your Vines your pumpkin

912
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,039
you can't layer it you can't have the

913
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,240
pumpkin on a shelf and grow Vines under

914
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,239
it you know the pumpkin and the plant

915
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,678
has got to be contained in 150 square

916
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:26,398
feet now how you make the design a

917
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,760
triangle a rectangle a square a diamond

918
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,398
whatever you come up with that's up to

919
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,800
de but you're only allowed 150 square ft

920
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:34,279
so this has created a big a big

921
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
challenge because now you've got to fit

922
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,919
the pumpkin the plant and everything is

923
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,639
in a very small area you know it's about

924
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,918
the tenth of a size of quote a normal

925
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,000
pumpkin plant thousand is square feet

926
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,918
potentially larger so this has taught us

927
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,280
a lot that we've had a grower who I've

928
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:51,799
actually known he's out in he's in

929
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,040
Massachusetts he's got the world record

930
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,960
for 150 square fet so in that small area

931
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:02,880
he grew a 1,000

932
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,480
375 pound pumpkin in that small area so

933
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,160
this has got us thinking now um yes of

934
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,760
course it's not the world world record

935
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:14,399
at 2,700 lbs but at 150 square feet

936
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:18,000
pumpkin in everything how much excess

937
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,280
are we growing um the plant and how much

938
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,838
is a bigger plant potentially for

939
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,240
growing the pumpkin growth this has been

940
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:26,358
a really interesting concept now of

941
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,719
course in 150 square ft you've got to

942
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:30,519
make sure everything's dialed in water

943
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,358
you know you've got you just have not a

944
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,000
lot of room for error if you have hail

945
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:36,719
that comes in or something that damages

946
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,880
a part of the plant yes you've got less

947
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,959
odds of growing a bigger pumpkin but

948
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,838
there's been multiple thousand pound

949
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,440
plus pumpkins grown in this very small

950
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:49,440
area so this has kind of got us away

951
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,679
from thinking that each Leaf produces

952
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,880
two pounds or whatever well just say

953
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,679
each Leaf produces a pound this was an

954
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,720
old school of thought that if I want a

955
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,598
th000 pound pumpkin I got to have a th

956
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,559
leaves I want a 2,000 B pumpkin I need

957
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:04,318
2,000 leaves and it really doesn't quite

958
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:07,078
work like that if you're growing a 1300

959
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:08,838
lb pumpkin in 150 square feet each Leaf

960
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,720
is producing quite a bit because each

961
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:13,279
square foot essentially is producing I

962
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:16,480
think it was like six or seven pounds on

963
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,240
average so um we've gotten away from the

964
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,800
increasing of plant size concept to

965
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:23,519
increasing efficiencies of plant now I

966
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,680
still grow a th000 square feet I still

967
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,318
think that's your best chance at the

968
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,679
potential for a world record um but if

969
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:33,880
you don't have that area which I know

970
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:37,960
many people don't 150 square ft when you

971
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,160
start weighing it out um it looks really

972
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,920
small and you don't think you can grow

973
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:42,559
anything in that but um you could

974
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,920
potentially grow a thousand plus pound

975
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,318
pumpkin in that small area so that's

976
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,280
increased the amount of people we can

977
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:50,480
get growing these which again helps the

978
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,160
sharing of information and just helps

979
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,599
the whole Community overall so that's

980
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,799
one of the key things of like bigger

981
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:59,160
plant bigger pumpkin um and I think

982
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,480
cannabis grows were well ahead of that

983
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:04,440
with their uh pruning methods and their

984
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,519
limitations of being only in a grow tent

985
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,240
um of course screen of green really

986
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,519
isn't quite the option for pumpkin

987
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,959
Growers but I call it the the lily pad

988
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,358
effect where I want all my leaves kind

989
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,519
of edge to edge I don't want to have

990
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:18,358
leaves shading other leaves um so it

991
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:22,039
kind of maximize that canopy if you will

992
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:24,639
so it's a similar concept um you know

993
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,119
pumpkins weigh in pounds canvas weighs

994
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,159
in grams but it's still all about weight

995
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,200
in the end no one really sees the plant

996
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,879
per se they only see the uh production

997
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:36,118
from the plant um so kind of again same

998
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,599
concept there of having a life cycle to

999
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,519
the plant not just pushing the heck out

1000
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,519
of it early on um co2 have done some

1001
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:45,838
experiments with that um that's really

1002
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:47,000
improved growth um on pumpkins again

1003
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,440
gotten from the Cannabis industry and

1004
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,760
Greenhouse industry as well um really

1005
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,679
trying to prove that yes this is some

1006
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,079
concepts are Universal they can help

1007
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,039
with pumpkins they can help with

1008
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,240
cannabis there can be some sharing of

1009
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,239
information as well across the two

1010
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,920
platforms when I was growing and this

1011
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,160
was over a decade ago and I want to say

1012
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,880
for people out there that are interested

1013
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:15,078
in trying it I had an empty space in my

1014
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,680
garden at my farm back in the day and I

1015
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,440
got seeds from uh friends of mine

1016
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,118
actually Ryan Ying out here in the

1017
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,760
Northwest you may know Ryan um and Dawn

1018
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,039
in Geneva I was I it's emans or Emmons I

1019
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,680
haven't seen them in a number of years I

1020
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,440
call Em I don't know okay former world

1021
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,000
record holders themselves and and they

1022
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,318
were one of the people that told me and

1023
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,199
this was again like probably 10 15 years

1024
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:39,000
ago now is less is more that was

1025
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,118
something that she was really big on and

1026
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,760
I and they were very accommodating and

1027
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:49,039
sharing um when I so I grew a I'll just

1028
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,880
say it was a 725b pumpkin which by giant

1029
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,119
pumpkin standard is is a toddler it's

1030
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,680
it's quite small uh but I did it you

1031
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,920
know in with a lot of neglect and no

1032
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,078
soil testing in just the soil that we

1033
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,639
had at the farm um watered when we

1034
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:04,680
remembered and pruned it when I had a

1035
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,118
moment

1036
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:09,000
so with the Improvement in genetics and

1037
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,440
everything I think it's very possible

1038
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
for a new grower you know as a hobby if

1039
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,800
they're not going for old world record

1040
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,280
but just wants to experiment to get out

1041
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,560
there and grow a really fun large

1042
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,880
pumpkin uh that I got to say the kids

1043
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:25,880
had a ton of fun with I fed it to the

1044
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,880
chickens afterwards um it was a blast so

1045
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,720
I encourage people to if you're

1046
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,079
interested in a hobby uh in growing and

1047
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,639
really want to see a plant actually

1048
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,400
physically grow in front of your eyes uh

1049
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,118
it's incredible like you'll go out there

1050
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,519
and it'll be the size let's say of a

1051
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,119
golf ball the next day it'll be a

1052
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:44,079
baseball and then the next day it'll be

1053
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,200
a beach ball like it's just incredible

1054
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,880
you literally watch it grow it's it's a

1055
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:51,399
ton of fun um I don't know if you want

1056
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,039
to add anything to that yeah no that's

1057
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,240
spot on I would again promote for new

1058
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,039
Growers we've had a lot that have had

1059
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,159
success and we're like where did you

1060
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,880
come from like well I found

1061
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,039
bigpumpkins.com would be the the website

1062
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,000
know that Tad mentioned earlier um that

1063
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,880
would be probably your best single

1064
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,358
resource now it is you are going to be

1065
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,358
inundated with

1066
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:14,920
information um there is a lot there but

1067
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,239
I would say to try to make it a little

1068
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,400
easier on someone um if you go to the

1069
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:22,118
grower Diaries in bigpumpkins.com and

1070
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,720
try to find because it's usually listed

1071
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,318
by of course everyone's handle name and

1072
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,719
then it usually lists their General

1073
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:30,719
location so if you have an idea of you

1074
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,239
know the region you might want to pick a

1075
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,039
couple growers in that region and kind

1076
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,000
of see what they do um and we've had a

1077
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,039
lot of Growers come out of the woodwork

1078
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,920
all of a sudden they show up at a way

1079
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,400
off no one's ever heard of them and

1080
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,200
simply through the research that they've

1081
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,760
done online literally through

1082
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:46,598
bigpumpkins.com they've really been able

1083
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,640
to speed up the learning curve or to

1084
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:51,318
kind of get some ideas of what people

1085
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:53,679
utilize in some areas for those people

1086
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:56,119
in the Colorado area just for a point of

1087
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,598
example they're using a lot more shade

1088
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,880
netting one because because their higher

1089
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,119
elevation and two Unfortunately they get

1090
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,838
a lot of hail so the shade netting

1091
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,280
protects the plants from hail and also

1092
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,440
Shades them a little bit more because

1093
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,760
they don't need all the Sun that they're

1094
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,000
getting and all the UV light that

1095
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,800
they're getting so that's just one

1096
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,280
little tip and trick there for people in

1097
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,119
that region where we're seeing it

1098
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,920
utilized more and more now in other

1099
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,960
areas because pumpkins don't quite need

1100
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,480
all the Sun that they're um able to get

1101
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,480
even at sea level um but that's just one

1102
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,960
kind of little way to help foro a season

1103
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,599
loss from a quick little hail storm um

1104
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,559
that comes by the uh one thing that I

1105
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,838
would add this one to just to bring up

1106
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,039
that anyone who's new to Growing always

1107
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:38,799
thinks this is something I get all the

1108
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,199
fairs I don't know where this started I

1109
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,760
wish I knew where it started because the

1110
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,919
marketing campaign on this is

1111
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,119
unbelievable everyone thinks that we

1112
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,079
milk feed pumpkins you add milk you

1113
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,358
inject milk you do something with milk

1114
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,079
um I can tell you 100% no one that I

1115
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:58,559
know and I know many world record

1116
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,440
Growers no one injects milk at any time

1117
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,639
uh where I think that came about looking

1118
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,159
back at it is back in the day someone

1119
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,879
grew a some really big pumpkins and they

1120
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,879
came up with this weird concept that

1121
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,358
they inject milk into their pumpkins and

1122
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,760
because they kept winning year after

1123
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,598
year people like well these winning so

1124
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,800
that's I want to be like the winner and

1125
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,680
I think the um the farmer was very

1126
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,960
clever in what he came up with because

1127
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,358
if you know anything about milk in the

1128
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,720
summer it ferments and it grows bacteria

1129
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:28,598
and if you're injecting that into the

1130
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:31,439
vine you're going to rot your Vines out

1131
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,838
so I think this um grower was very smart

1132
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,599
in saying this is what he did so that

1133
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,679
Evan went out and tried it and rotted

1134
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,280
all their Vines out and he kept winning

1135
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,239
so as far as one thing that giant fumkin

1136
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,559
Growers do not do that for whatever

1137
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,879
reason everyone thinks that we we do uh

1138
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,720
we don't inject any milk um into the

1139
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,318
pumpkins we don't inject any milk into

1140
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,159
the vines we don't really do anything

1141
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,199
particular with milk the only thing that

1142
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,679
you could use milk for which is was part

1143
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:01,358
of my research was how you can spray it

1144
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,759
on the leaves to reduce powdery Milo

1145
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,719
that's about I remember when that first

1146
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,319
came out that was a that was a big deal

1147
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:10,118
for people um in fact actually I was

1148
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,318
talking to a a fruit grower yesterday

1149
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,079
who was experimenting with milk uh

1150
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,558
because of that paper now the one thing

1151
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,839
the one complaint I have about milk is

1152
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:23,359
that it's white and it leaves a residue

1153
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:25,960
that looks a little like powdery me but

1154
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:28,039
um can you get the same success uh using

1155
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,440
lactobacillus for for example or does it

1156
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,400
really need is it the enzymes in the

1157
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,318
milk itself like could I make a rice

1158
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:38,000
wash it's been shown I know with um out

1159
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:39,800
of the cow we call raw milk it's been

1160
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,440
shown with pasteurized milk it's been

1161
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,720
shown with whey um it's been shown with

1162
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,920
all those I'm not sure quite about that

1163
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,000
Source there um the advantage to the

1164
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,559
milk is it's kind of like at a

1165
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,760
three-part kind of active ingredient

1166
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,880
it's got It's basic po mild likes an

1167
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,720
acidic kind of environment so the

1168
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,200
basicness of the milk health

1169
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,358
usually the fat if you're using um I

1170
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:02,879
usually recommend whole milk if you're

1171
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,039
going to choose a milk because that

1172
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,800
helps coat the leaves so you get a

1173
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:09,199
little better coverage and it um kind of

1174
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,920
binds up on the surface of the leaf so

1175
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,199
that if pow mil do is to land on the

1176
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,240
leaf it doesn't recognize it's on host

1177
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,719
and it just kind of stays dormant it

1178
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,598
doesn't start to grow and produce uh yes

1179
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,838
there's different concentrations you can

1180
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:24,480
utilize uh the advantage to it you can't

1181
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:26,358
burn a plant you know I've had Growers

1182
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,559
that put a high concentration go out in

1183
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:31,318
High Noon super strong sun to try to

1184
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,680
burn the plants can't burn them I'm not

1185
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,679
saying go spray in high noon but um you

1186
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,279
can utilize that um you know there's no

1187
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:39,838
real major negative side effects if you

1188
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,559
go too high in concentration it smells a

1189
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,599
little bit like a cheese factory but a

1190
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:47,240
couple rainstorms that usually goes away

1191
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,079
yeah there can be some residue um 20% or

1192
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:53,959
so um up to 40% milks and the rest just

1193
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,079
water usually works just

1194
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,599
fine that's that's really helpful for

1195
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,240
folks and then the the other thing I was

1196
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,000
thinking of in regards to milk is the

1197
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:06,919
the the calcium needs of both cannabis

1198
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,159
and pumpkins I wonder if that was part

1199
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,880
of it we know you know plants need

1200
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:14,199
calcium maybe the idea was that milk

1201
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,519
added calcium I mean we typically you

1202
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:20,239
would use things like gypsum or lime to

1203
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:23,199
properly manage the the Agronomy in your

1204
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,838
field to be clear but um yeah I wonder

1205
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,199
if that's where it started yeah it's

1206
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:29,159
just an interesting concept that somehow

1207
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,719
universally at every Fair I've worked at

1208
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,679
answer questions everyone's like oh you

1209
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,279
milk feed them like it just

1210
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:36,719
Universal um by talking hundreds of

1211
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,800
thousands of people and telling them we

1212
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,759
don't there's always a couple people

1213
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,200
that come in and still think we

1214
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,200
do I that is one thing I do want to

1215
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,439
bring up is it's really fun for folks

1216
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:49,838
especially with with kids if you do want

1217
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,679
to grow a giant pumpkin there's

1218
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,159
typically competitions in your area like

1219
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,480
I'm in the Seattle area and there's a

1220
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:58,159
few local we offs like one is at the

1221
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,440
largest uh Fair that we have in the area

1222
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,639
and so you can take your pumpkin there

1223
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,200
you can win cash prizes uh though

1224
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,400
they're typically not gonna compensate

1225
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,519
you for the amount of time that you put

1226
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,318
into the pumpkin or the the cost but um

1227
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,719
it's it's a fun process and it's a

1228
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:15,279
really uh heartwarming Community to be a

1229
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:17,799
part of everyone's really accommodating

1230
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,680
and friendly so yeah just want to thr

1231
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,079
look up giant pumpkin loffs California's

1232
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:24,000
got the biggest one on the west coast

1233
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,800
that's Half Moon Bay that's Columbus Day

1234
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,679
weekend somewhere I think it's that

1235
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,280
Monday uh um that's probably the biggest

1236
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:32,239
one out west coast but yeah look for

1237
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,599
giant pumpkins and it's great to kind of

1238
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,439
Meet The Growers if you found out when

1239
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,559
the way off is great to get ideas

1240
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,720
usually very willing to share seeds um

1241
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:44,040
so just if you're interested in getting

1242
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:46,078
into the the community it is a very

1243
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,199
welcoming uh

1244
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,318
Community yeah so I want to I want to

1245
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:52,759
change directions here and I'm not a big

1246
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:54,759
product gu I mean I I have a company

1247
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,920
that sells products but I I always like

1248
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,440
to look at plants by what is the

1249
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,519
limiting factor of growth sometimes it's

1250
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,280
not fertility but when it is fertility

1251
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:07,039
um I want to think about like what sorts

1252
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,319
of things do I like to have in my pantry

1253
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,199
you know I mentioned gypsum that's one

1254
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,920
of my favorite amendments for for

1255
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,598
calcium like what what do you as a

1256
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,119
grower like to keep in your quote

1257
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:22,680
unquote Pantry um to have on hand so I

1258
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:26,640
keep um I don't keep very much I know it

1259
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:29,719
sounds weird um for pumpkins something

1260
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:32,759
that probably isn't welln um and I try

1261
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:35,799
to tell people I believe they're hire

1262
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:39,559
manganese consumers than most people

1263
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:43,519
realize and that's MN not mg so not

1264
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:46,920
magnesium but manganese MN um that is

1265
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,480
something it looks like and continuing

1266
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,400
to do research contining to see some

1267
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,039
things that manganese sulfate is one I

1268
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,519
definitely make sure I keep on hand that

1269
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:57,480
is probably something that most Growers

1270
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:59,838
aren't

1271
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,559
realizing or even considering I guess at

1272
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:06,078
the most point uh speaking of gypsum for

1273
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,599
your calcium um the other key component

1274
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,599
um yes you can add a lot of calcium and

1275
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,800
that's great but really what helps get

1276
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:15,480
it into the plant is boron so I always

1277
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,039
keep uh Boron on hand because that helps

1278
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,519
with calcium availability now when I say

1279
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:26,318
keep Boron on hand I think I bought a

1280
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:28,800
5B bag of solubor 4 pound bag of solubor

1281
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:32,039
how many ago and it looks like I barely

1282
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:36,079
used it I've used it quite a bit um but

1283
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:37,920
it's very small amounts so we're looking

1284
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,599
at again that Trend going back to our

1285
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,358
previous conversation keep these

1286
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,599
nutrients on hand yes but it doesn't

1287
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,078
mean I'm adding them pound by pound by

1288
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,559
pound by pound unlike a gypsum I would

1289
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,720
add by pound that one you can add quite

1290
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,559
a bit of um but some of these other ones

1291
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,558
these specialty ones very small amounts

1292
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,599
I also like a little again it's another

1293
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,400
little one calcium nitrate for your

1294
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,000
nitrogen Source you need a nren Source I

1295
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,358
don't care if it's blood meal I don't

1296
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,920
care if it's fish Emulsion I don't what

1297
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,880
you need that you need some sort of

1298
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,159
nitrogen Source particularly when you

1299
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,240
get a lot of heavy rain we just got

1300
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:09,960
actually the national news in

1301
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,318
Connecticut here we just literally

1302
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,000
unexpectedly no tropical storm no

1303
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,440
hurricane no anything we had some towns

1304
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,599
not very far from here get over a foot

1305
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,838
of rain in a 24-hour period not rare I

1306
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,480
should say very rare in this area not

1307
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,318
very common uh it's a 1,000 year storm

1308
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,480
or something but what that's going to do

1309
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:30,679
is that's going to flush a lot of your

1310
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,119
nitrogen out as well as some other

1311
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:34,199
nutrients but nitrogen is usually be the

1312
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:35,640
first to go so it's good to have a

1313
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:38,719
little nitrogen Source just to give

1314
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,838
something back um to help buffer that

1315
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,959
leeching effect that may have occurred

1316
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:45,078
in the event you get a heavy rainstorm

1317
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,760
so I do like to keep some nitrogen

1318
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:51,280
Source um on hand for sure I also do

1319
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,200
keep a little bit of a um it's a name

1320
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,240
brand wise it's called it's plant Marvel

1321
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,960
it's a it's a km mag it's a it's a blend

1322
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,598
um I think it's a

1323
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,838
15530 somewhere around there I think

1324
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,160
it's 15% nitrogen 5% phosphorus 30%

1325
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:10,558
potassium U it's like the Miracle Grow

1326
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:12,000
it's blue chemical fertilizer uh keep a

1327
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,440
little of that on hand it's a good

1328
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,199
supplement contains a lot of micros uh

1329
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,400
nutrients just a quick little

1330
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:20,239
supplemental feed that kind of checks

1331
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,960
all the little boxes if I need to just

1332
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:25,879
give a general kind of supplementation

1333
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,440
um feed a lot ofs don't realize is

1334
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,480
probably what I rely on most is just uh

1335
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:33,159
compost that I've I've added when I say

1336
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,960
I've added compost I have not added

1337
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:37,960
compost in 5 to seven years um I got the

1338
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,519
levels up to where I wanted it was Leaf

1339
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,720
Bas based compost out here in the east

1340
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:44,639
coast we've got a lot of maple trees and

1341
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,039
some oak trees and they produce a lot of

1342
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,879
Leaves we got to rake up um so mulch

1343
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,719
them up and um let them sit for a couple

1344
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,358
years the town actually provides a leaf

1345
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:55,039
based compost that they suck up all the

1346
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,798
leaves and provide back to the residents

1347
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:01,199
so that's a great source but I added

1348
00:50:57,798 --> 00:51:04,440
fair amount of that added about 30ish 30

1349
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:07,838
to 40 yards of that per th Square ft but

1350
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,079
I kind of did it once wow and that's it

1351
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:11,960
um it was probably a little a little um

1352
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,280
little heavy um looking back probably a

1353
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,400
little on the heavy side um but I have

1354
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,720
not needed to add any compost for the

1355
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,200
last five to seven years I forget

1356
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:23,759
exactly have to look back at my records

1357
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,639
when I added it um but again that

1358
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,839
concept you get to that level and you

1359
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:29,960
don't need to keep I don't need to add

1360
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,838
20 yards of compost every single year to

1361
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,079
keep getting the same results I've got

1362
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:39,440
the stable stable soil shall we say and

1363
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:41,720
now I'm just kind of supplementing with

1364
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,079
things wow you you brought up a ton of

1365
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:46,719
great stuff and I some questions so uh

1366
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,519
first off with the the kmeg is that like

1367
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,480
sulfate of potach

1368
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:53,000
magnesia yes it crystals because it's

1369
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,039
it's their own proprietary blend I'm

1370
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,559
sure but it is basically um a potassium

1371
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:00,519
sulfate really get the 30% plus

1372
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,400
potassium and then it's got a just a

1373
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:07,280
general mix of everything else I can

1374
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,240
let's see if I can uh get you the exact

1375
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,559
okay because that sounds a little

1376
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,759
different than kmeg as I understand yeah

1377
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,400
it's it's there it's I should say it's

1378
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,640
the um plant

1379
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,880
Marvel's um version of kmag I guess is

1380
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:21,920
the best way to put it okay because kmeg

1381
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,920
I know they make an organic version I I

1382
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,440
just know this because we sell it it

1383
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,720
dissolves in water it looks like little

1384
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,920
crystals um um that might be a little

1385
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:30,279
different than what you're describing

1386
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,838
just for people who are listening and

1387
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,640
trying to find the product um you

1388
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:36,480
mentioned calcium nitrate the other

1389
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,838
thing around nitrogen I want to mention

1390
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,599
uh my good friend Bryant Mason who's a

1391
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:43,199
wonderful agronomist talks about how

1392
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:45,359
nitrogen is primarily cycled uh based

1393
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,358
around temperature and so if you get

1394
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:49,719
cold temperatures you may also need to

1395
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:51,279
supplement nitrogen as well as the

1396
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:54,919
leeching effect that you mentioned so I

1397
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:57,240
wanted to touch on that and then um with

1398
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,400
trace minerals I just want to mention

1399
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:01,279
with us with cannabis on our Target

1400
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,119
recommendations we hadn't been adding in

1401
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,760
trace minerals because we typically get

1402
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,640
some from the

1403
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,040
compost sometimes they're a little bit

1404
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:10,759
low and again I'm talking about mostly

1405
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,279
indoor soilless media just for

1406
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:16,599
comparison for people who are listening

1407
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,760
to but um when we have we've recently

1408
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:21,280
started adding some of those back in at

1409
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,760
low levels but we have found with a lot

1410
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,798
of canvas Growers is they add too much

1411
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,799
and too much is much worse than too

1412
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:31,199
little and I just want to emphasize that

1413
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:33,920
because when you get too high on especi

1414
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:36,879
specifically Boron you can really create

1415
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,079
toxicities that will do more damage than

1416
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,280
good um but we have started making a

1417
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:43,920
manganese recommendation on our soil

1418
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,720
test for folks because with cannabis we

1419
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,039
are seeing actually that a little bit of

1420
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:53,318
a magnes manganese excuse me hunger

1421
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:55,960
um more so than we had realized so uh

1422
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:57,599
that is something that we we also are

1423
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,358
focused on on with our cannabis

1424
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,838
recommendations so I just wanted to

1425
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,719
highlight that as well um but yeah

1426
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:09,159
that's wonderful So you you're relying

1427
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:11,159
primarily on creating a healthy soil mhm

1428
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:13,159
with good levels of organic matter good

1429
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:14,838
biology from the compost and the way

1430
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:17,598
that you're managing that soil and then

1431
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:19,759
you're supplementing that with uh based

1432
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,680
off of your soil test it sounds like and

1433
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,799
tissue

1434
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:25,960
testing I call it the um soil

1435
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:27,400
Hydroponics concept which I know is

1436
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,199
going to drive a lot of cannabis Growers

1437
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,559
crazy because soil and hydroponics don't

1438
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:34,960
seem like they meet but kind of using

1439
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:37,280
the soil as the basis of most of the

1440
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,079
nutrients the nutrient load I should say

1441
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:44,839
and then hydroponically or supplementing

1442
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:47,880
in um these very light dose fertilizers

1443
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:49,798
as the plants need or as the weather

1444
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,838
conditions warrant or as the plant

1445
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:53,358
develops at a certain stage like I was

1446
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,838
saying as pumpkin grows needs a little

1447
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:57,639
bit more pottassium so kind of spoon

1448
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,119
feeding dosing a little bit of that

1449
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:03,318
maybe a little bit later in the season

1450
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,720
um but not really adding hundreds and

1451
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:08,000
hundreds of pounds of fertilizer really

1452
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,759
just kind of feeding what the plant

1453
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,838
needs and what the plant it might be

1454
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,160
running short on or what the microbes

1455
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:14,358
just can't keep up with you know like

1456
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:17,039
you're saying early in the season when

1457
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:19,279
the soil's cold after a heavy rain event

1458
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,400
the microbes will make nitrogen but in

1459
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,200
those conditions maybe they just need a

1460
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,880
little help or the plant just needs a

1461
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:26,798
little bit so it doesn't go hungry and

1462
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,920
then it back off and let them mics kind

1463
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,440
of refeed into the um the ecosystem

1464
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,880
there so it's not overriding everything

1465
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,960
and not being completely dependent on

1466
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,039
everything I feed it but just that

1467
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,960
supplemental feed for the pumpkin or

1468
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:42,599
cannabis would be in the same uh same

1469
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,838
realm great did you want to mention the

1470
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,240
plant Marvel product so people can find

1471
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:49,480
it if they are curious yeah so I just uh

1472
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:52,239
I can send it to you if you want it's a

1473
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,719
plant Marvel neutri culture it is called

1474
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:57,159
their

1475
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:59,480
kbag spoon feeding soluble fer

1476
00:55:57,159 --> 00:56:02,759
15530 plus

1477
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:05,119
micronutrients not sponsored by I wish I

1478
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,200
was sponsored by some um but not

1479
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,400
sponsored by them but that is one that

1480
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:14,118
has a good General I'll just say Miracle

1481
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,079
Grow like um fertilizer that really

1482
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,920
dissolves well in water it's great for a

1483
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,599
quick feed it's great for just a good

1484
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,280
supplemental feed

1485
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,318
there not organic just for anyone

1486
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,599
unfortunately not organic yes just just

1487
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:30,639
to clarify but yes that is an option

1488
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:34,838
um changing directions again we talked

1489
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:37,000
about phosphorus a little bit and um

1490
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:39,159
it's really an issue of of maintaining

1491
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,719
low levels of phosphorus availability

1492
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,239
more so than having this massive Reserve

1493
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:45,279
that you know we talked about people

1494
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:47,919
were over applying it earlier what are

1495
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,640
your thoughts around micro isal fungi I

1496
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,358
know it's associated with uh increased

1497
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,358
nutrient uptake of a lot of nutrients

1498
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:55,598
but phosphorus is the big one that that

1499
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:59,838
people talk about when they talk about

1500
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:02,119
migral fun fi um I I know from talking

1501
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,400
to Pumpkin Growers a lot of them were

1502
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:07,480
adding it at at all the different uh for

1503
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,798
the secondary Vines and all the nodes um

1504
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,719
what are your thoughts around not just

1505
00:57:09,798 --> 00:57:13,639
the use of micro isal fungi but also the

1506
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:17,000
application rates do we need to be

1507
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:20,480
adding it every planting uh directly to

1508
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,960
the roots what do you think so for mroi

1509
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,679
in general um it does phosphorus really

1510
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,559
well as well as um copper I think is the

1511
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,598
second one it helps a lot with what it

1512
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,000
does in general um for those just

1513
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,519
listening to give you a quick background

1514
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,358
is it basically creates a better net in

1515
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:40,480
the soil so a pumpkin root a cannabis

1516
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,838
root um is quite large and it's really

1517
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,798
the root hairs that do a lot of the

1518
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,199
absorption well the fungus is really

1519
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:48,519
fine and really helps increase soil

1520
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,838
contact that really helps be able to

1521
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:52,358
come in contact with phosphorus so it

1522
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,000
can absorb it the advantage is the

1523
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:56,159
fungus will give the phosphorus

1524
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,039
essentially to the plant or host plant

1525
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:01,519
Canabis pumpkin whatever and in exchange

1526
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,440
the plant gives the fungus sugar so the

1527
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:06,280
the fungus can grow better so the the

1528
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,880
fungus is getting sugar from the plant

1529
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,599
and the plant's getting phosphorus maybe

1530
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,680
some Copper from the Fungus so it's a

1531
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,920
true symbiotic relationship meaning

1532
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,279
they're both benefiting the fungus loves

1533
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,798
it because it can't it's in the soil

1534
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,400
can't do photosynthesis sugars are hard

1535
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:19,960
to come by well the plants got all its

1536
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,639
leaves up above ground so it's able to

1537
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,358
absorb all the Sun and it's got excess

1538
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:26,679
sugars hopefully that then it gives the

1539
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:28,719
um the fungus there so it's a great atic

1540
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:30,480
relationship how much do we need to add

1541
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,358
or how much damage are we doing it to it

1542
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,400
potentially as I mentioned these really

1543
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:36,358
fine networks like a fishnet well if you

1544
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,400
till your soil of course you're going to

1545
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:40,078
be chopping up a lot of those mycelium

1546
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,079
lot of those High a lot of those kind of

1547
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,318
nice little Network that's kind of

1548
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,119
created um so what pumpkin Growers were

1549
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:47,880
doing is they were adding it at every

1550
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,760
every leaf node because wherever there's

1551
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,720
a leaf node for giant pumpkins as well

1552
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,280
as some other pumpkins they will sit

1553
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:56,199
down a root so the concept was when that

1554
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,440
root comes out we want the fungus there

1555
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:02,239
so it can start to form that Association

1556
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,798
really quickly um however it seems like

1557
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,199
in what I've seen at least from the

1558
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:08,759
giant pumpkin standpoint um is that

1559
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:11,279
because the plants grow so aggressively

1560
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,640
I'm not sure how much of a benefit the

1561
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,960
plants are getting from the phosphorus

1562
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:17,558
uptake I think it might be a little more

1563
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,920
limiting um shall we say that if I add a

1564
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:22,519
liquid feed of a little phosphorus I

1565
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,680
think that's more plant readily

1566
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:28,960
available um to to the host plant

1567
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:31,318
because they're un quote so fast so for

1568
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,920
adding micro rizy I used to add it you

1569
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:36,199
know in the planning hole and at the um

1570
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,240
uh Vine but building up enough in your

1571
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:40,879
soil there's going to be a lot of

1572
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:43,719
natural um micro Riza potentially a lot

1573
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,798
of natural bacteria in there so I

1574
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:48,318
personally don't add any of it um

1575
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:50,798
anymore to my pumpkin plant to as a Vine

1576
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:53,920
Berry or anything like that so I feel

1577
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:57,400
creating the organic matter base that I

1578
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,720
have is creating a favorable environment

1579
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,960
uh for those all to kind of live in

1580
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:04,078
where I think mic razi offers by far the

1581
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,199
best um advantage and this is you a

1582
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,880
little different than cannabis a little

1583
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:10,639
different than um pumpkins is for um

1584
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,440
foresty trees so in Forest regions where

1585
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,960
there's trees growing where really

1586
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,318
nutrients are very hard to come by and

1587
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,920
there's a very

1588
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:20,480
stressful condition there because yes

1589
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,200
may they might be recycling some of the

1590
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,519
leaves and to bring some organic matter

1591
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:27,279
up but Forest region you dig down in a

1592
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:30,000
forest you get down couple inches it can

1593
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:33,079
be a very uh difficult soil to really

1594
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,798
support large plants so I think having

1595
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:38,240
the micro rizing in that instance is

1596
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:40,239
very beneficial because one you're not

1597
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,000
tilling up the soil very often those

1598
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:44,479
trees are going to establish that

1599
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,559
mycelium um quite well um they're not

1600
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,119
going to be tilled up they're going to

1601
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,319
benefit from the stressful conditions

1602
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:52,358
that they're in and I think that is

1603
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:54,679
definitely where microing can really

1604
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:56,519
offer a potential benefit and kind of

1605
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:59,038
the annual producing

1606
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,440
areas I think the benefits might be more

1607
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:05,000
limiting um just simply of the general

1608
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,838
practices that we do unfortunately um to

1609
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,039
get that true establishment there I'm

1610
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,599
not sure exactly how much of a benefit

1611
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:15,440
that's truly offering in in annual uh

1612
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:17,640
there might be some initial benefits uh

1613
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,318
but long range as far as mining all the

1614
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:20,480
phosphorus by time they produce all that

1615
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:22,599
might see them get all those little

1616
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,079
hairs out there odds are the plant's

1617
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:27,200
probably going to be to term and it's

1618
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,720
going to be ready quote for next season

1619
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,279
and you've probably established enough

1620
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:33,118
of those resting uh spores in there for

1621
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,240
the following

1622
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,280
year some other thoughts around uh

1623
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,558
microle funi and feel free to correct me

1624
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,119
too if if you say anything that you uh

1625
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,039
disagree with but um micro isal fungi

1626
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:48,039
high levels of uh phosphorus

1627
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,640
applications will limit micro isal

1628
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:52,400
infections so if you're

1629
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:55,920
applying uh you know phosphoric acid for

1630
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,000
example you may limit the plants dis

1631
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,559
desire I guess or need to form that

1632
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
relationship with the plant and it is a

1633
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:02,440
symbiotic relationship so it needs to

1634
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,639
come in direct contact with the root

1635
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,798
there's no point in scattering it

1636
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:07,719
throughout your soil in addition these

1637
01:02:05,798 --> 01:02:09,639
fertilizers that listed on there don't

1638
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:11,358
assume that the the Spore count is high

1639
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:12,639
enough to even get infection a lot of

1640
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,759
times they'll put in just a pinch and

1641
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:15,960
then say with micro Asal fungi on the

1642
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,278
label so you really want to get a

1643
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,199
specific inoculant for the specific type

1644
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:22,199
of plant you're growing and that that

1645
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:24,838
means if you're growing uh the good news

1646
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:27,078
is most of these are endom micro risal

1647
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:29,920
fungi but you want get the right species

1648
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:33,240
which is uh you know could be Riso fagus

1649
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,400
or regularis glomus inates glus mossier

1650
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:40,078
they they specific ones for and it's the

1651
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:43,318
same for fruit trees curbit uh Tomatoes

1652
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:45,160
cannabis they all utilize the same sort

1653
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:46,558
of sets of endom micro isal fungi

1654
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:47,879
fortunately you just want to make sure

1655
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,480
when you look on the label what you're

1656
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,838
getting math is what you actually need

1657
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,079
because I've seen products that that

1658
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:56,798
contain both endo and Ecto micro isal

1659
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,839
fungi and you may have 50 spores per CC

1660
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:02,038
of endo micro risal and then like 1.2

1661
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:04,558
million spores of ecto micro isal which

1662
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:06,960
is specific to conifers and this these

1663
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,440
forestry situations and so they're not

1664
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,278
really forming a relationship with your

1665
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,720
plant so you do need to do a little

1666
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:15,000
research if you are going to use it if

1667
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,959
you're disagree with no that's good if

1668
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,798
you're resting in area and you kind of

1669
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,838
want to build up the micro Razzi in that

1670
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:25,318
area the quote quickest um zenas uh

1671
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:27,519
which is a beautiful flower um is got

1672
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:30,480
one of the highest

1673
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:32,400
micro Association plants and really can

1674
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,400
help build up numbers as quick as

1675
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,318
possible because I believe that's what

1676
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,200
most of the more commercial producers of

1677
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:40,318
said micro are using actually Zenia

1678
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,278
Roots so if you find little root

1679
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:45,278
fragments they're probably zenas because

1680
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:47,400
of the um increased Association and ease

1681
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:49,239
of Association I should say that those

1682
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,358
have so if you're resting in area and

1683
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:53,639
really want to build up that micro

1684
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:55,440
inoculate it U your Zenia seeds plant

1685
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,960
your zenas enjoy your zenas and you'll

1686
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,519
be good for the soil as

1687
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,880
well that's a really useful tip and then

1688
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:04,440
the last thing I want to mention is I

1689
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:07,680
did see some research out of Italy um

1690
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,599
talking about using micro isal fungi in

1691
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,798
conjunction with cannabis and what they

1692
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:16,079
found was an increased uptake of heavy

1693
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:17,920
metals which makes sense to me based on

1694
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,278
understanding the pathways of of how

1695
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,278
heavy metals are taken up and how

1696
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:25,239
cannabis is a dynamic accumulator and

1697
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:29,159
how micro isal fungi also helps increase

1698
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:31,199
that nut uptake so if you are in a state

1699
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:33,798
where you're being regulated for heavy

1700
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,919
metals and you're using uh soiless media

1701
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:38,000
that contains some heavy metals um I

1702
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,358
would I would caution folks before

1703
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,239
adding micro isal fungi uh in some of

1704
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:44,759
the tighter regulated States just for

1705
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,798
that reason something to

1706
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,039
consider yeah I want to say I've got

1707
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:51,000
something on the channel on that um

1708
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,000
maybe it could be the same

1709
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,798
study I Tred I reached out to the

1710
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,199
researcher I tried to get it on um I

1711
01:04:55,798 --> 01:05:00,719
tried to get her on the podcast but I

1712
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,519
didn't have any luck with that um but

1713
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:03,959
yes I I believe so and I I'll try and

1714
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:06,199
track it down though before we publish

1715
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,720
this but

1716
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:13,439
um yeah I think at least for us heavy

1717
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:15,278
metals is a a bigger and bigger issue in

1718
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,358
the Cannabis industry I don't know I see

1719
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:18,960
you've done I just searched heavy metal

1720
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:20,558
on your YouTube channel as well and I

1721
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,838
got a bunch of hits so there is some

1722
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,119
information on there did you have any

1723
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:27,719
highlights regarding heavy metals that

1724
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,838
you wanted to touch on for Growers it's

1725
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:32,318
something that Growers should be looking

1726
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:35,078
at in their

1727
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:37,558
coas that's my biggest recommendation

1728
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:40,599
there is it is definitely something that

1729
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:43,359
Growers um consumers Growers whoever

1730
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:44,960
need to be uh mindful of that that can

1731
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:47,239
be an

1732
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,838
issue yeah if you type micro Razzi for

1733
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:53,439
cannabis production I do have the video

1734
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:57,639
on it and um let's see it could be they

1735
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,639
sound Italian names it was from 2005

1736
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:03,719
looking at cadmium nickel and

1737
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:05,558
chromium significantly enhancing

1738
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:09,439
translocation of

1739
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:10,920
those yeah so be careful folks if you're

1740
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,358
if you're thinking about using these

1741
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,119
products and then also be aware with

1742
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:17,358
heavy metals that compost and water are

1743
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,318
are probably two of your biggest sources

1744
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,960
of contamination in addition to

1745
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:24,519
fertilizers but I I typically see higher

1746
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,358
levels in coming in from compost and

1747
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:29,838
from water sources than anything so I

1748
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:31,719
always start with those two things um

1749
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:35,159
well we've been chatting for a while

1750
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:38,639
here um I know you're a busy guy was

1751
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:40,000
there any last little uh pointers or

1752
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,960
comparisons that you wanted to make

1753
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,719
between giant pumpkin Growers and the

1754
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,440
Cannabis industry cannabis Growers no I

1755
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:49,239
would say again if you're a cannabis

1756
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,679
grower to honestly check out big

1757
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:53,558
pumpkins uh.com would be a great

1758
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:55,038
resource there to just see what the

1759
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:56,480
giant pumpkin Community is doing now it

1760
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,000
is a little more seasonal because

1761
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,880
they're not really growing um indoors

1762
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,278
but that's uh something there to look at

1763
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,400
um and for cannabis Growers themselves

1764
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:07,599
again the YouTube channel there debacco

1765
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,720
University would be something I'd

1766
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,798
recommend them to take a look at I try

1767
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:14,278
to respond to every comment um it gets

1768
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:16,278
tough at certain times um but if you

1769
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:18,719
type a comment in I do try to get back

1770
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:20,239
to you at least one time if you ask a

1771
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,399
follow-up question I probably will miss

1772
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:25,519
that one um but um I appreciate you

1773
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,039
having me on the uh the podcast here and

1774
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,159
if people have other specific questions

1775
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,200
or if you want to have me on again uh

1776
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:33,960
I'd always be willing to come on uh for

1777
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,358
another round there t I really

1778
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,440
appreciate that and I appreciate the

1779
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,038
