00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,679
hussey of kiss organics this is the

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,199
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,720
perspective and drawing top experts from

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,160
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,799
wisdom and knowledge

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,039
my guest this week is dr anna paltzeva

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,718
as an international urban soil scientist

12
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,719
and assistant professor

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,079
dr paltzeva's mission is to educate

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,600
communities about the critical

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
importance of soil health in growing

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
nutritious food supporting healthy

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,359
ecosystems and helping to reduce harmful

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,120
greenhouse gases

19
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,719
her expertise is in helping people

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,198
identify and remediate soil

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039
contamination in urban gardens she has a

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,198
passion to help others to understand the

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,198
impact of heavy metals on the health of

24
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,320
soils and the best way to improve soil

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,679
quality

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
in addition to her appointment at the

27
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,159
university of louisiana at lafayette she

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
is taught at new york university cooney

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,560
brooklyn college and the new york

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,478
botanical and brooklyn botanical gardens

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,200
this has led to her creating the delta

32
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,359
urban soils laboratory at ull that

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,280
provides soil testing services and

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,599
informal education to communities and

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
businesses across the country now on to

36
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,959
the show

37
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,279
hi anna thanks for coming on the show

38
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,279
today

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,879
hi i'm so glad to be here and share what

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,759
i know about soils and hopefully get

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,000
excited people excited to test their

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,680
tools and learn more what's in their

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,078
soil

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,640
absolutely absolutely so i found out

45
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,399
about you through bryant mason of soil

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,439
doctor consulting he had mentioned you

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,599
to me in regards to heavy metals

48
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,078
but can you just give you know listeners

49
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,118
a little bit of background into uh who

50
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:02,959
you are and what you're doing

51
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,319
of course so i am dr anna beltwa i'm

52
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
also known

53
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,038
by anya which is russian nickname

54
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,639
i grew up in russia in the south of

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,759
russia in my parents garden i used to

56
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,839
play in

57
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,519
this dirt when i was a child

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,840
and this

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,280
childhood game became my career

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,439
eventually but both of my

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,439
parents are agronomists and they taught

62
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,479
me how to

63
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,199
take care

64
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,479
soil our land and grow our own

65
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,679
vegetables

66
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,959
and food

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
so i brought my family trade to the next

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,360
level

69
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,000
by

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
conducting research in urban

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
soil in

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,159
urban agriculture and i got my doctorate

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
degree in earth and environmental

74
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,120
sciences

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
at the city university of new york

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
graduate center

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,598
a couple years ago

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,439
and basically since then well for the

79
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:04,560
last seven years since i started my phd

80
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,158
i focused on urban agriculture urban

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,400
soil contamination

82
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:14,000
and soil testing which also led me to

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,239
open up recently my very own delta urban

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
source laboratory at the university of

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,759
louisiana at

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,919
where i'm currently an assistant

87
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:27,439
professor in environmental sciences

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,359
that's so wonderful and i i think your

89
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,519
area of research is just really

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
fascinating when we talk about urban

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,319
soils

92
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,878
you know trying to grow food in the city

93
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,919
uh is really challenging and the big

94
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,439
issue is is content soil contamination

95
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,280
related to

96
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,799
you know things that we're dumping into

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,439
the soils things that are leaching into

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,760
the soils and these heavy metals

99
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,680
can you talk about

100
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,719
some of the research that you did around

101
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,719
around heavy metals

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,239
of course yeah so the

103
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:07,120
starting well when is yeah started like

104
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,120
2013 when my phd advisor offered me to

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
do a test

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,000
on

107
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,359
studying bio accessibility of web and

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
back then i didn't know what by

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,079
accessibility was but basically now i

110
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,160
can easily define it as a fraction of

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,519
harmful contaminants or metals like lead

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,160
that we determine in soil in order to

113
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,159
understand how that particular fraction

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
uh can affect

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
human health

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
so

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,800
basically what

118
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,359
we find is that not all

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,759
metals are harmful

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,639
and not all total concentrations are

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,840
harmful so let's take a lead for example

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,639
if we find uh with a standard method

123
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
that

124
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,639
there is um

125
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,879
like 1000 parts per million of latin

126
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,720
soil it's a very high number but it

127
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,719
doesn't mean that all of this one

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,360
thousand parts per million is going to

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,479
be harmful for humans or plants it

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,240
really depends on what form the sled

131
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,879
exists in soil and this form

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,079
will determine the bioaccessibility

133
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,600
it can be low or it can be high

134
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:25,359
depending on the chemical state of this

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,400
metal if it's let's say um

136
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,800
lead it will combine with organic matter

137
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,758
with the phosphates it will be very

138
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,079
stable thereby accessibility will be low

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,879
so let will be present still in the soil

140
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,758
but it's not going to be uh harmful or

141
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,399
at least a much lower level

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080
harmful to plants or humans but if it

143
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,599
exists in the form of

144
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:52,319
like lead carbonates it may be more

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,960
soluble in the environment thus more

146
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,918
harmful so my research started with

147
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,120
assessing different methods on

148
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,198
um

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
specifically on the accessibility of

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
lead

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,600
and it led me to develop two

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
different methods in collaboration with

153
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,160
the

154
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,478
columbia university research group and

155
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
university of bolasea in italy research

156
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,279
group

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,280
on how we use instruments to

158
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:27,439
by accessibility of lead in soil using

159
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,839
um x-ray fluorescent analyzer machine

160
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,959
and another one was visible near

161
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,758
infrared spectroscopy

162
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,399
this uh method allow us to

163
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,199
quicker assess the harmful fraction of

164
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,159
the soil not just total concentrations

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
uh

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,520
and uh be able to test more soils so

167
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,399
samples at a shorter period of time

168
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,399
so

169
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,598
so what you're saying is

170
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,198
it's really important to look at how

171
00:06:54,598 --> 00:07:00,240
bioaccessibility in that how

172
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,360
easily can the plant uptake

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,759
that particular heavy metal and um one

174
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,720
of the factors that you mentioned is the

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,319
the form that that heavy metal is

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,919
in the chem the actual chemical form of

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,439
that of that heavy metal in terms of

178
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,279
what it's bonded to

179
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,519
um what are some of the other factors

180
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,318
like i just off the top of my head here

181
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,879
i'm thinking that um plant selection

182
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,360
would play a big role ph

183
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,519
um the

184
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
hydrology or the amount of moisture in

185
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,198
the soil

186
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,399
how do all of these sort of come

187
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,160
together in terms of determining um

188
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,439
you know if you can grow a safe crop in

189
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,680
the in a given soil

190
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,800
that's a great question and all of those

191
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,680
factors it did have a huge role in the

192
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,918
availability of metals and soil

193
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,199
and uh we found that a plant type is

194
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,839
actually a more important uh

195
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,478
than amendment type that we tried to use

196
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,038
to remediate soils because plants would

197
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,000
react differently some plants would take

198
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,560
up more lead and arsenic that we studied

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,439
some of them would not or it would be

200
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,639
more susceptible to

201
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,279
get contaminants on the leaf surfaces

202
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,800
for example like leafy greens spinach or

203
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,519
lettuce from splashes from surging areas

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,120
or

205
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,598
dusty positions

206
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,959
so really plant selection plays a huge

207
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,878
role which also means that we can grow

208
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,679
some vegetables in

209
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,639
moderately contaminated soil

210
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,278
uh

211
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,000
if those like we grow tomatoes or

212
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,559
eggplants or squash something that will

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,200
be growing further from the surf surface

214
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,239
of the soil because plants have

215
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,480
physiological barriers inside of them

216
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,159
like food vegetables and if they grow

217
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
further from the soil then it will not

218
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,679
have a

219
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,080
splash from surrounding areas

220
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,919
and then it will leafy greens and then

221
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,519
root vegetables will be of course more

222
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,199
susceptible to this level contamination

223
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,959
another factor like

224
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
ph that you mentioned which is really

225
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,399
huge is that

226
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,759
most of metals will be least available

227
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,159
at ph close to neutral so

228
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:21,360
like slightly acidic to neutral ph

229
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:25,439
metals will be least available while

230
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,680
nutrients will be mostly available

231
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,959
so nature is smart as i like to say it

232
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:34,319
makes nutrients available and metals no

233
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,119
but once it drops ph drops to very

234
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,240
acidic levels it can make

235
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,959
lead and arsenic for example more

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,600
available for

237
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,679
plant uptake or human impact so it's

238
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,278
really important to keep ph close to

239
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,359
neutral as possible organic matter is

240
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,480
another one that's really important to

241
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,120
mention because it burns lead

242
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,000
or some other metals and forms organic

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,200
mineral complexes which are more or less

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,480
stable

245
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,200
and it will take time for organic method

246
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,759
to degrade to release those metals again

247
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,320
so we found it to be an effective way to

248
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,200
remediate soils by adding compost to

249
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
contaminated sites

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,920
and on top of that it also has a

251
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:25,599
dilution effect when we add the extra

252
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:28,240
volume of compost or any other organic

253
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,639
amendments to the soil

254
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,480
it dilutes the over concentration of

255
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:38,319
metal in that soil plus vegetables that

256
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,680
grow in that soil will typically have a

257
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
high yield as would be larger in size

258
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,599
so

259
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,159
it also creates a second dilution effect

260
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,278
in a let's say tomato food

261
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,278
um

262
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,519
or an eggplant

263
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,000
so compost is really great way to

264
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,919
remediate contaminated soil

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,278
another factor is also you mentioned

266
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,799
moisture indeed it's good to have a

267
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:07,679
moisture in soil especially with if it's

268
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:11,120
the summer and it's very

269
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,278
very windy or

270
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,919
it's like it's a

271
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,278
area that's susceptible to erosion so

272
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:21,838
moisture helps to reduce dust and

273
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,838
redistribute contamination so it's

274
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,079
really good to have it

275
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,600
another factor is a

276
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,958
soil composition is it centrosol or clay

277
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,000
soils

278
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:37,359
clay soils may hold more contaminants as

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,919
much as they hold nutrients while sandy

280
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,480
soils more permeable and that consists

281
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,559
of cords and cords doesn't really hold

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,320
uh hold on much

283
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,799
of nutrients or contaminants on their

284
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,600
surfaces so there will be more leaching

285
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,879
happening in san diego compared to clay

286
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,680
soils

287
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,078
that will act like a sponge

288
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,159
you're referencing the cec or cation

289
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,039
exchange capacity of a soil and the

290
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:06,480
higher the cec the higher the ability to

291
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,639
retain heavy metals in that soil

292
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,440
yes there are cations the positive

293
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,440
metals yeah yeah and then what about the

294
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
anions though

295
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
in a higher c

296
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,799
soil would you still see more anion

297
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,759
retention

298
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,919
they

299
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,600
there's a possibility they will be leach

300
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,319
out more

301
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,320
okay in the ground like arsenic is more

302
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,800
leachable for example than

303
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,040
lead light will stay in the soil it's

304
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,159
not very mobile but arsenic that

305
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:39,039
typically in a negative form the arsenic

306
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,879
arsenide will uh susceptible to

307
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,719
leaching and moving down in the soil

308
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,278
profile

309
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,079
so um

310
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,838
you mentioned compost now i think of

311
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,000
compost as a source of soil

312
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,680
contamination in terms of heavy metals

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,879
as well depending on

314
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,479
where that compost is sourced because

315
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,799
i mean frankly locally a lot of the

316
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,720
municipal composts um

317
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,559
aren't really doing good testing and

318
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,680
they're composting some some uh

319
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,278
you know i think

320
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,559
somewhat uh mixed material where

321
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,838
people are throwing stuff into their

322
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,479
yard ways that they shouldn't be

323
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,360
essentially um so

324
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
how

325
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,600
how does one evaluate compost

326
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,599
to know if what they're adding is

327
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,440
actually going to be decreasing their

328
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,920
heavy metal load or or potentially

329
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,399
increasing it

330
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,599
great point and we also found that the

331
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,559
some compost that were buying for our

332
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,879
research

333
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,278
contain elevated concentrations of

334
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,799
metals that shouldn't be there

335
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,439
and of course we didn't use them for

336
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,120
research but it was a really interesting

337
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
discovery

338
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,039
to answer a question basically testing

339
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,920
is important you

340
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,519
should

341
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,759
periodically test samples or bags of

342
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,839
compost or any other amendment that you

343
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,679
buy in the market

344
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
and it's a really good investment if you

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,599
want to make sure you're not adding

346
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,000
additional heavy metal concentrations

347
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,000
uh you will still get some of the metals

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,720
because metals

349
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,639
you know they present in plain tissues

350
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,879
but they should be at a low

351
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,360
concentration

352
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,720
unless those composts are made from

353
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,800
contaminated manure or from trees uh

354
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
leaves from the trees that grow next to

355
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,719
road

356
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,198
um

357
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,680
other type of compost if it's like you

358
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,679
make your homemade compost it's going to

359
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,239
have very minimal

360
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,120
metal concentrations it shouldn't be

361
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,278
harmful so testing is really important

362
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,278
to understand what levels you add into

363
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,360
the soil so you don't create

364
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,838
accumulation of this metals and i think

365
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,839
that that's the answer you either make

366
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,560
your compost yourself and you know what

367
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,720
you put on the compost or you test what

368
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,278
you buy

369
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,879
and you know so for one of the things i

370
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,799
want to talk about with you is the fact

371
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,039
that um

372
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,240
i agree testing is so important but it's

373
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,559
been it's been not affordable for people

374
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,799
it's been way too cost prohibitive i

375
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,638
know when i first got

376
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,078
my soil mix tested a potting soil

377
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,000
to make sure that we were meeting the

378
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,679
requirements of a fertilizer because of

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,919
the amount of nutrients we're putting on

380
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,159
it's a much higher requirement so if i

381
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,439
were just going to sell potting soil i

382
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,399
wouldn't have to test it for heavy

383
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,800
metals and that's what 99

384
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,159
of the industry does right now um

385
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,000
and so we we don't really know what

386
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,278
heavy metals are in our potting soils

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,039
because no one's testing them and no

388
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,799
one's testing the vegetables if you

389
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,958
register as a fertilizer it's a higher

390
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,559
requirement anyway long story short the

391
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:44,000
cost to do that was a few hundred

392
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,000
dollars it was quite expensive um

393
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,519
and then i get a guaranteed analysis and

394
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,440
then i can put this gets publicly

395
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,039
published um

396
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
but i i agree with you this is really

397
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,480
important but as a homeowner i also

398
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,000
wanted to test my

399
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
soil in my backyard because i wanted to

400
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,120
grow vegetables but being that it was a

401
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,639
suburban area you know i didn't know

402
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,198
what construction had been done on the

403
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,320
property before i before i bought it and

404
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,078
you know i didn't know if things had

405
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,120
been dumped here by a previous homeowner

406
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,278
or things had leached so

407
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,198
talk to me about this this lab testing

408
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:18,399
that you're doing and you know the

409
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:23,319
pricing and just how amazing this is now

410
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,320
is a way for people to test their soils

411
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,320
yes you brought up really great points

412
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,440
it's important to know

413
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,440
land use history land management

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,079
history of your property

415
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,120
and if it's possible to find those

416
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,519
documents or maybe look up on some epa

417
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,240
websites they always have really great

418
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
uh

419
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,079
tactic maps or information on the area

420
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,799
so you could get an idea what

421
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,799
potentially could be in your soil and

422
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,919
see the proximity to

423
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,078
highways or form industrial sites at

424
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,319
least get an idea what could be found in

425
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,958
your soil

426
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,360
the in terms of testing in the labs

427
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,838
of course commercial laboratories

428
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,240
they would charge certain amounts of

429
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,359
dollars for their testing typically

430
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,838
university labs are much more

431
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,719
affordable

432
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,639
from my experiences working at

433
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,480
new york and brooklyn college and here

434
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,759
it's lafayette

435
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,919
we

436
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,640
not doing it for profit it's not for

437
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,559
private organization really we use this

438
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,480
lab

439
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,480
expenses or cost

440
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,839
to cover um

441
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,160
the materials

442
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:41,359
uh we used to to test the soil

443
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,360
and really support students so

444
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,879
the method we're using for example to

445
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,240
test ex

446
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,120
heavy metals is an express technique uh

447
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,640
it's actually called exportable x-ray

448
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,798
fluorescent um analyzer instrument

449
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,919
that we used a lot in new york and we

450
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,000
have here in lafayette and it's uh

451
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,960
reduces the cost because the machine

452
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,960
itself is much

453
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,798
less expensive than mass spectrometers

454
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,280
that uh commercial labs typically use

455
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,720
and those mass spectrometers of course

456
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:19,918
provide high accuracy and precision but

457
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,120
modern xrf uh machines they have

458
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,120
actually um

459
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,918
good results they're very reliable a4

460
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:33,678
are properly prepared

461
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,440
and the way we achieve this uh relative

462
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,559
accuracy is by

463
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,919
um let's say you send me soul sample we

464
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:44,000
will analyze it by first

465
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,360
dry in the oven reducing the moisture

466
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,880
condition like get rid of any of the

467
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,918
moisture then sieve it to two millimeter

468
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,559
size to create the homogeneity of the

469
00:18:51,919 --> 00:19:00,320
sample and then measure this uh soil in

470
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:03,519
special cups with a special film that

471
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,678
does not have impurities on it

472
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,279
on this extract machine and it's a

473
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,840
result that give us close

474
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,879
proximities to the mass spectrometers

475
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,119
and this reduces the cost because the

476
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,679
instrument is much less expensive than

477
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,959
mass spectrometers and it requires less

478
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,280
time to prepare and analyze soils

479
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,000
because when you do a mass spectrometer

480
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,079
analysis it takes a few days when you

481
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,079
have to prepare the sample like dry it

482
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,399
save it through then you have to weigh

483
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,240
it very small

484
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,080
numbers like

485
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,960
0.2 or 0.3 grams and then you have to uh

486
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,279
add

487
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,279
different assets to it so

488
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,440
you have to put it in the microwave or

489
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,440
in a hot plate and then they have to run

490
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,960
into mass spectrometers so it will take

491
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,320
several hours then you have to process

492
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,880
the data so all of this will require

493
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,119
more time and of course

494
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
more it becomes more expensive when you

495
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,319
have to pay for

496
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:08,080
the time of the lab technician assets

497
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,798
for machine spms maintenance maintenance

498
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,879
is quite expensive so

499
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,679
what we have been using here is this

500
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,720
extra portable machine that allows

501
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,480
much faster results and

502
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,400
less time

503
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,400
to process the

504
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,480
salt soil samples it can be also

505
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,919
fertilizers it can be

506
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
different amendments compost some sort

507
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,919
of

508
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,600
solids that we can

509
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,120
analyze

510
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,480
in those

511
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,719
xrf cups that they call the small

512
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,720
plastic cup that we use for the machine

513
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,880
and we need typically

514
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,880
at least like one centimeter depth of

515
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,319
the material to analyze it

516
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,558
so if i understand you correctly you're

517
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,918
saying that the methodology that you use

518
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,798
is

519
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
uh

520
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:06,240
not maybe not quite as accurate

521
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,960
as a mass spectrometer but it correlates

522
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,720
well so it'll give you within a a fairly

523
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,159
good standard deviation of what you

524
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,798
would get from a mass spectral

525
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,520
spectrometer but the method itself is

526
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,639
dramatically less expensive and much

527
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,279
faster

528
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,600
so um

529
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,960
it's just a huge savings in both time

530
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,519
and money so

531
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
we've been using your labs now for a few

532
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,759
months

533
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,759
testing uh you know formulations for uh

534
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,119
fertilizers as well as our so our

535
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,960
potting soils

536
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,639
i haven't tested any actual soils with

537
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
you yet

538
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,400
but that's something i'm looking forward

539
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,919
to in the future too but

540
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,159
you have the ability to test all of

541
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:50,000
these things

542
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,240
correct yes and also the good point to

543
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,038
to notice that

544
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,079
this procedure is like having it

545
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,079
um

546
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,879
slightly less precise and accurate than

547
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,279
mass spectrometers but you can test more

548
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,760
samples with this uh

549
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,639
for the same amount of money you could

550
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,519
test more samples and it will resemble

551
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,360
variability of your soil or potting mix

552
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,038
or whatever you're doing

553
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,240
because the

554
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,879
soil typically is very ortho mixes very

555
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,359
heterogeneous and soil in general is

556
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,080
super heterogeneous at your property

557
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,240
your soil on the lawn versus soil next

558
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,558
to foundation of the house or under a

559
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,400
tree or in your vegetable garden might

560
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:37,038
be very different

561
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:40,400
so it's better to test more samples as a

562
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,798
slightly lower accuracy

563
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,320
but get a larger number of samples so

564
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,319
you get a better understanding of what's

565
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,720
actually happening in your soil and

566
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,519
unless you're doing analytical chemistry

567
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,640
it doesn't matter if you're

568
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,798
um i don't know if you got like 25 parts

569
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,280
per million of lead versus 20 parts per

570
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,279
million applied you know so it's um

571
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,798
it's really important to detect the hot

572
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,279
spots of contaminants and compare them

573
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,200
to guidelines to see if they're higher

574
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,079
or lower

575
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,919
and i think for regard for an average

576
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,918
gardener that's more important to test

577
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,320
more samples to understand what's

578
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,440
happening in the entire property than

579
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:25,359
just test one representative sample

580
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,279
on the

581
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,158
expensive machine

582
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,839
versus have multiple samples tested

583
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,760
that's a really really good point and

584
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,519
from a statistical perspective by

585
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,359
increasing your end value the number of

586
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,519
samples that you're taking you know i

587
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,959
could probably take eight eight or nine

588
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,400
samples for the price of what it would

589
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,840
have cost me to go with the mass

590
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,798
spectrometer

591
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,720
i can i can graph those and and plot

592
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,960
them and then come up with a more

593
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,120
consistent value across

594
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,798
all of those that would probably be as

595
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,519
accurate or even more accurate of what's

596
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,639
actually going on in my soil or in my

597
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,839
fertilizer than you know one one sample

598
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,278
so

599
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,158
that's that's a that's a really good

600
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,159
point you brought up there

601
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,798
yeah and this is the something that the

602
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,798
labs university labs i have noticed for

603
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,319
reading research not just in the united

604
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,639
states but in some other countries as

605
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:20,240
well start using more and more there's

606
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,480
my ref method it's uh there are epa or

607
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,640
usda methods uh

608
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,519
how to use i think it's epa

609
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
um

610
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,558
protocol so it developed to just follow

611
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,840
the procedure how to prepare a sample

612
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,440
and analyze it which also a discussion

613
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,519
also allows to

614
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
test soil

615
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,759
in a

616
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,759
natural environment like outside

617
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,240
of course the result may be less

618
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,000
accurate because if it's moist or it's

619
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,720
more heterogeneous

620
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,480
but still if you go around

621
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,079
the sheet or even the

622
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,640
garden we can detect the hot spots of

623
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,798
high levels of metals and collect those

624
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,840
specific samples

625
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,240
um

626
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,720
and it's really good to understand

627
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,440
variability in the garden or in the city

628
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,880
like this is what i'm aiming to do in my

629
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,519
research is to analyze

630
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,600
soil in lafayette and see how metals are

631
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,759
distributed here

632
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,079
and this instrument allows us to do it

633
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,200
in a real-time

634
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:28,720
setting when we go around we analyze it

635
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,798
we get the data within 90 seconds and

636
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,640
then we can collect samples from

637
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,839
highly contaminated areas and bring them

638
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,000
to the lab

639
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:42,158
for further more accurate analysis

640
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,480
now in your research how are you finding

641
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,039
uh soil depth or compaction influences

642
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,079
heavy metals like are the heavy metals

643
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,919
more at the surface of the soil because

644
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,439
i know you were talking about dust and

645
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,840
things like that or are you finding them

646
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,519
further down like could i grow a crop

647
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,558
that's a deep rooting

648
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,879
crop as a way of of potentially helping

649
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,278
remediate them or am i less likely to

650
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,640
have contamination growing

651
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:09,519
you know something like a lettuce that's

652
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,159
a very

653
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:15,519
low rooting yeah so it's typically

654
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,840
closer to topsoil or on top of the soil

655
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,000
if you don't add compost to your soil

656
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,798
just say it's normal soil

657
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,720
you will see it's a closer to the

658
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,038
surface or

659
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,000
really like top soil that most likely

660
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,798
contaminated from all these deposits

661
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,278
over the last um i don't know like 100

662
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,960
years that lead has been used

663
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,440
uh where other metals been used and

664
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,640
deposited from industrial sites from

665
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,038
highways from lead paint

666
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,360
if you add something like your compost

667
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,640
over and over every year then of course

668
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,599
your bearing burning your contaminants

669
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,440
under

670
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,678
which is another remediation technique

671
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,360
by the way with burning contamination on

672
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,720
the compost layer

673
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:04,000
uh so we ask top soil is most likely

674
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,278
going to be contaminated uh surface soil

675
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,558
compared to

676
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,880
subsoil and dust and splashes is

677
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,839
something to be concerned about if soul

678
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,120
is contaminated and if there are any

679
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,798
children around it's really important to

680
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,719
make sure

681
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,038
kids are not playing in contaminated

682
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,480
soil

683
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,158
that's a really good point so even if

684
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,079
you don't plan on growing vegetables if

685
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,679
you live in an urban environment this

686
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,319
would be a very simple way to just make

687
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,480
sure that your yard is safe

688
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,839
for your kids to play yes

689
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,839
it's even more important than for

690
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,439
vegetables because vegetables

691
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,439
as i said like they pick it they can

692
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,278
some of them can grow

693
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,720
well and safely some of them like

694
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,319
carrots should not be grown in

695
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,319
contaminated soil but for children it's

696
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:53,200
imperative to test

697
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,200
soil the backyard to make sure the kids

698
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,640
are not exposed because the primary

699
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,278
pathway of heavy metal exposure for

700
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,679
people is actually

701
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,640
ingestion and house does

702
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,880
so

703
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,080
children who are playing in the

704
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,919
backyard on a bare soil they would touch

705
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,960
fingers and then lick their fingers

706
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,278
ingesting potentially contaminated soil

707
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,919
and this should be avoided and to do

708
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,159
that first test the soil see what the

709
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,960
levels you're getting and then

710
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,000
plant some lawn on top or put some some

711
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,880
sort of fabric some protection layer so

712
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,720
children are not exposed to bare soil so

713
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,720
definitely parents who have small

714
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,480
children should test their soil just to

715
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,480
prevent potential exposure

716
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:44,640
yeah that's a great point i as a new

717
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,158
parent to a two-year-old i am always

718
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,440
thinking about this as someone who

719
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,039
thinks about soil a lot and right now

720
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,200
we're living with my in-laws and they

721
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,038
live on a golf course and i watch the

722
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,200
chemical applications that are happening

723
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,839
onto the grass on the golf course

724
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,679
and i don't want my daughter to lay

725
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,839
anywhere near that grass

726
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,120
for a lot of those reasons so

727
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,240
you know i think as parents that's

728
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,759
something we definitely want to be

729
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,839
thinking about and i know i've seen

730
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,440
research that shows that children uptake

731
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,038
these

732
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,840
chemicals and and i'm assuming these

733
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,599
heavy metals quite readily uh

734
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,678
even sometimes

735
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,879
more so than adults

736
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,559
so

737
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,200
i i think that's a wonderful point for

738
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,440
people that live in cities or in areas

739
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,120
that have been contaminated

740
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,240
i'm thinking of oklahoma just because i

741
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,158
do a lot of work in oklahoma and

742
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,480
i know there's a lot of contamination

743
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,360
sites there

744
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,679
so you know parents please do consider

745
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,599
getting your soil tested and we'll list

746
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,360
all the ways to uh

747
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,918
or the method to go about getting a hold

748
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,479
of anna and submitting samples to her

749
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,559
lab on on the podcast page

750
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,640
so people can get that information and

751
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,678
absolutely get a hold of you for this

752
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,399
um

753
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,320
so let's and we have also practices how

754
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,918
to remediate soil in case it's

755
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,759
contaminated i will share those

756
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,720
resources as well that was my next

757
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:09,599
question so let's say i send in my

758
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,278
sample to you and whether i'm growing

759
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,879
cannabis vegetables i just want to

760
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,240
protect my child and know

761
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,480
the ground safe

762
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,480
it comes back with high levels of

763
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,599
arsenic or high levels of lead or

764
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,000
cadmium

765
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,000
what do i do

766
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:30,079
yeah so it will depend on how high those

767
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:33,519
levels are but uh

768
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,359
and where the how big the distribution

769
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,119
is it's the whole garden or just a

770
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,199
vegetable plot

771
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,719
so some of the basic techniques to

772
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,880
remediation

773
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
is

774
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,880
adding compost

775
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:52,158
or some sort of organic metal like mulch

776
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,840
or something else that will help to

777
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,200
dilute the soil

778
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:59,359
and um bind metals with this organic

779
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,080
matter

780
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:05,038
another option um

781
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,678
is to put lawn on top

782
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,398
uh there's some sort of grasses though

783
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,399
they'll to

784
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,319
cover uh bare soil so there's no dust

785
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,360
there's no erosion happening

786
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,480
reducing the potential runoff of the

787
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,678
soil

788
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,480
we can uh

789
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,798
so plenty of vegetation adding compost

790
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,399
or some sort of organic amendments you

791
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:33,918
can try and change uh chemistry of these

792
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:35,918
metals by adding a phosphate amendment

793
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,240
or phosphate fertilizers

794
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,480
although we found it

795
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
would be tricky for

796
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,720
an average person

797
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,880
to figure out how much to add and how

798
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,360
long it will take to break down there

799
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,640
are some studies that uh did successful

800
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,798
job with the

801
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,960
change in your chemistry of lead and

802
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,480
converting it to program work it's a

803
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,960
stable plus a light phosphate mineral

804
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,960
but for an average person it can be

805
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,519
tricky to add i and someone

806
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,519
sometimes

807
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:14,558
if it's possible you can bring a new

808
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,399
soil and you clean a sediment um from

809
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,839
if it's some organic methane of course

810
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,000
for nutrient content from another area

811
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,599
some people

812
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,440
take it from

813
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,558
maybe like a farmland they know it's

814
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,558
clean or in new york for example there's

815
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,440
a program that's called the clean soul

816
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,960
bank when actually distributes a glacier

817
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,159
sediment

818
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,640
um

819
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,840
of two community organizations it's

820
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,080
mostly sand but it's clean it's pristine

821
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,359
because it's uh was

822
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,918
collected from

823
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:51,199
deep layers when the foundation of a new

824
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,679
building is being constructed

825
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,840
and that glacier sediment in the

826
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,159
community garden let's say can be mixed

827
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,199
with the compost to provide nutrition

828
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,440
value

829
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,360
and successful plants can grow and of

830
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,480
course it's

831
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,719
much much safer for children so if there

832
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,640
is a way to bring a new

833
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,798
soil it's a possibility

834
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,480
using raised bed soil

835
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,440
or build a raised bed on top of

836
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,200
contaminated soil it's an option if you

837
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,480
don't worry about children if you don't

838
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,278
have a

839
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,839
small kid and you only want to grow

840
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,880
vegetables and you don't want to do any

841
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,038
amendments or any compost additions then

842
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,919
grow tomatoes

843
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,119
they

844
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
found to be

845
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,639
um at the monthly grown well in the

846
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,120
modern contaminated soils because they

847
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,960
have physiological barriers inside of

848
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,278
them that prevent

849
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,360
metals to be uptaken uh to foods and

850
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,519
they're further from the surface that

851
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,479
tall plants and they don't really have

852
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,278
uh

853
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,440
splashes from surrounding areas so those

854
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,720
will be very simple

855
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,278
techniques

856
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
uh probably least expensive of course

857
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:07,519
you can excavate it and bring absolutely

858
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,320
new soil but it will be more expensive

859
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,000
so so we've been talking about soil as

860
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,720
the primary

861
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,239
source of contamination

862
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,239
but can we talk a little bit about

863
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,320
where this is all coming from it's not

864
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,679
like that soil started out contaminated

865
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,679
um

866
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,918
where where is this contamination coming

867
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,599
from and how do we limit that in you

868
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,918
know not just our gardens but also our

869
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,919
homes

870
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,079
uh good good question so

871
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,639
one thing to know that the metals

872
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,960
naturally occur in soil from parent

873
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,000
materials such as rocks and minerals but

874
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,398
those levels are typically very low

875
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,199
and they're not harmful to people

876
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:53,598
because they're natural sources

877
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,239
hello we do have anthropogenic sources

878
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,838
of metals which in most cases is

879
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,479
industrial sites it's uh roads cars

880
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:04,480
vehicles and

881
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,880
paint

882
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,800
leaded paint of course it has been

883
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,519
banned since 1978 but lead paint is

884
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,440
still on some old houses

885
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,639
so it's important for people to know

886
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,240
what kind of pain they have on houses if

887
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,279
they if they live

888
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,039
in them

889
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,560
and they know they're

890
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,519
before 1970 so the most likely will have

891
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,599
some

892
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,599
lead so it's really important to know

893
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,599
that part and then do testing of

894
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,760
surrounding areas if possible you can

895
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,200
even test paying cheap these days as

896
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,280
well

897
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,358
so it's important to reduce the house

898
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,560
dust so especially if there are children

899
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,480
in the house

900
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,759
by doing a cleaning just like you know

901
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,000
with a

902
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
some

903
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,199
wet napkin or something for the so they

904
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,319
could to bring down the dust that's just

905
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,879
one of the

906
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,440
main sources inside of the house and

907
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,559
this dust can come from you know from

908
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,838
windows from open doors from shoes that

909
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,559
people work outside or walk just outside

910
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:14,159
and bring this dust and dirt into the

911
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:15,358
house so to avoid this leave shoes

912
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,598
outside

913
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,719
uh or change shoes when you walk inside

914
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,880
don't bring

915
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,039
dirty

916
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,960
instruments from the garden into the

917
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:29,599
house and do um

918
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,280
wet cleaning like wash floors and wash

919
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,800
window ceilings

920
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,880
uh so yeah those are basic

921
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,079
recommendations uh to reduce

922
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,039
contamination inside of the houses um we

923
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,200
cannot change land you do use history of

924
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,199
locations where we live you know they

925
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,358
had some industry industrial sites in

926
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,919
the past but we can

927
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:52,639
control our environment inside of our

928
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,440
homes by just doing good cleaning

929
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,879
periodically and testing

930
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,838
what's um

931
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,599
surrounding our houses and knowing the

932
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,159
history of the house or at least when it

933
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,160
was built

934
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,519
that's it that's a good point and one

935
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,358
other thing people i want people to

936
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,199
consider when we're talking about edible

937
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,519
crops and food crops is everything that

938
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:15,358
those roots or that soil is coming in

939
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,280
contact with so if you're going to build

940
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,000
a garden think about the material that

941
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,320
you're using to build with

942
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,400
even with fabric pots i've saw some

943
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,480
research some pots coming out of china

944
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,358
that showed high levels of lead so when

945
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,039
those roots hit that edge of fabric that

946
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,239
fabric pot they're being exposed to that

947
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,880
lead and they could potentially be

948
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,319
taking it up so

949
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,480
there's just a lot of things you have to

950
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,160
really think like a scientist or like a

951
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,599
detective when you start thinking about

952
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:46,239
read labels too yes yes so

953
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,800
um well great i want to kind of change

954
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,799
directions here um

955
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,720
we've been talking about heavy metals

956
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,920
related to gardening and urban soils um

957
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,639
since this is a

958
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,639
cannabis cultivation podcast and i know

959
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:03,279
your experience is not with cannabis i i

960
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,199
wanted to talk a little bit about

961
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,880
heavy metals that you know some of the

962
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,118
how that might relate to cannabis and

963
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,200
get your thoughts on some of this so

964
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,240
one of the things is in certain states

965
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,358
now they're testing the flower

966
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,639
for

967
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:21,838
arsenic cadmium and lead and

968
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:24,719
at fairly aggressive thresholds

969
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,320
and cannabis appears to be

970
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,719
a fairly

971
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,320
good at uptaking not just nutrients but

972
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,159
these heavy metals

973
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,079
and we are seeing some failures in

974
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,759
certain states based on uh the

975
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,440
methodology that people are using um

976
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,880
you've already talked about ways to sort

977
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,159
of reduce

978
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,160
heavy metal exposure

979
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,160
you know we're not testing vegetables

980
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,200
like this do you think that down the

981
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,920
road

982
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,759
policies might change in terms of how

983
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,280
how we're testing like maybe cannabis

984
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,440
might be

985
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,519
sort of an example for how we may

986
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,159
eventually test

987
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,159
vegetables

988
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,400
that's a very interesting question i

989
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,079
think uh

990
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,480
part of the answer here would be

991
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,960
to understand that cannabis is not a

992
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,000
simple plant it's hyper accumulated

993
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,599
plants and that plant basically

994
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,760
is capable of

995
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,720
uptaking metals from

996
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,520
soil and i think this is why

997
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,639
policy is really forcing on

998
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,159
measuring

999
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,440
cannabis

1000
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,719
not so

1001
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,880
all vegetables have taken up metals at

1002
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,439
the same level so each vegetable of food

1003
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,039
or berry or tree versus grass they have

1004
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,800
their own capabilities how much they can

1005
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,559
or willing even to uptake metals and how

1006
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,480
they tolerate it

1007
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,078
some can be

1008
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,199
more susceptible

1009
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,640
than others some plants may be

1010
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,439
affected by

1011
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:02,639
even low toxicity levels others can be

1012
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,039
much higher some of them prevent

1013
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,199
contaminants going into their tissues

1014
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,920
like tomatoes so there's no

1015
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,719
need as much as cannabis to test tomato

1016
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,480
plants so it's really um

1017
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,000
important to understand what type of

1018
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,000
plant that is

1019
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and when it comes to hyper chemical

1020
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,440
plants or plants that we know

1021
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,239
can take

1022
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,599
more metals than the average plants then

1023
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,118
it needs to be

1024
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,200
more vigorously

1025
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,200
regulated

1026
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,118
i'm not a policy person but like from a

1027
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,838
science point of view that's how i see

1028
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,920
it

1029
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,440
i i mean i would love to see i would

1030
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,599
love to go to the grocery store and

1031
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,559
eventually have their be you know

1032
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,800
conventionally grown organically grown

1033
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,279
heavy metal free

1034
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,680
you know have some of these new labels

1035
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,079
that would allow me to make choices

1036
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,399
because i would pay a little bit more to

1037
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,640
know that what i'm buying is

1038
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,318
is free of of certain contaminants

1039
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:59,679
beyond you know just the organic

1040
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,519
certification

1041
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:04,000
um but

1042
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,960
who knows that's a great point and i um

1043
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,318
yeah

1044
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,760
i don't know the answer to the question

1045
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:09,920
but i think it's definitely more

1046
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,560
interesting and it comes back to

1047
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,559
uh testing and pricing for testing right

1048
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,960
because we have to test everything

1049
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,679
everything then every batch it will be a

1050
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,599
lot of data a lot of processing a lot of

1051
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,118
labs and a lot of delays

1052
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:29,039
uh but i think having more vigorous food

1053
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,720
testing is good and i know fao recently

1054
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,960
was bringing it up that they were

1055
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,959
collecting data from scientists around

1056
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,119
the world on

1057
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,039
i think it was mercury and fish they

1058
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,119
wanted to see more data on it so i think

1059
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,800
it is moving towards

1060
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,640
uh food

1061
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,440
safety testing um and metals and perhaps

1062
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:52,000
other contaminants as well but it you

1063
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,079
know it takes some time to

1064
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,039
be able to test everything

1065
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,640
so

1066
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,519
can i share with you some of what i've

1067
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,000
found in in cannabis um

1068
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,318
related to heavy metals and please just

1069
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,639
correct me if anything i find seems to

1070
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,719
say seems odd or wrong or

1071
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,559
inaccurate um

1072
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,000
but since

1073
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,838
since we've been we've been diving more

1074
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,599
and more into this this heavy metal

1075
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,400
thing because

1076
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,480
we've had a few growers fail and you

1077
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,240
know as someone who manufactures soil in

1078
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,400
addition to this podcast

1079
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,159
and the fact that we do organic soil and

1080
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,838
organic amendments

1081
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,078
you know there is always going to be

1082
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,519
some heavy metal load in our soil and so

1083
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,280
we're always looking at how to reduce

1084
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,599
this because we use things like rock

1085
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,920
dust which as you know contains

1086
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,960
levels of heavy metals

1087
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:45,200
and soft rock phosphate um

1088
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,199
you know any mined product or

1089
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
in my experience contains some level of

1090
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,879
heavy metal so it's all about heavy

1091
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,838
metal management we can't reduce it to

1092
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,519
zero

1093
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,838
but we want to make sure that we're not

1094
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,199
overloading it and then

1095
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,559
beyond that

1096
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,799
keeping our ph a little more alkaline so

1097
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,960
i like to run my ph higher than

1098
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,039
traditional um

1099
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,838
agronomic recommendations

1100
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,639
um

1101
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,358
probably closer six eight to seven range

1102
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,480
rather than you know six four six five

1103
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,639
like i see

1104
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,679
like i see in a lot of places

1105
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,199
um

1106
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,118
it's sort of the sweet spot for me in

1107
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,519
terms of having in terms of reducing

1108
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,480
heavy metal risk but still allowing for

1109
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,599
good nutrient availability

1110
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,119
in terms of exposure so um you know i

1111
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,640
just want to throw out there no one's

1112
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,400
failed just using our soils we've always

1113
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,400
found other sources of contamination

1114
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,559
that were more significant

1115
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,838
and really contributing to a fill

1116
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,358
rate um

1117
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,199
some of these were

1118
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,199
water sources people thought they had

1119
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:48,078
clean water but they were from a well

1120
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:50,960
and they actually were bringing up

1121
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,960
ground water in this case it was arsenic

1122
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,199
i had another one in the facility that

1123
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,119
was an old building in oklahoma city and

1124
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,799
they were doing a lot of construction

1125
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,480
and they were kicking up dust and that

1126
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,960
dust was falling onto the leaves and

1127
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
causing contamination

1128
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,720
so that was a little bit of a tricky one

1129
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,880
to figure out

1130
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,879
even things like uh

1131
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,039
sump pumps or

1132
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,440
metals that are in contact with water

1133
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,838
for a long time like in a reservoir or

1134
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,838
through an irrigation system we found

1135
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,799
can increase a heavy metal load

1136
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:25,119
too um

1137
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,560
so it's it's it's a challenge and you're

1138
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,680
always trying to figure out what it is

1139
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,039
and then

1140
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,318
um

1141
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,159
i i guess

1142
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:33,679
one thing you brought up was phosphates

1143
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:37,440
which i thought was really interesting

1144
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:39,039
and how they might bind up um lead

1145
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,639
you know one of the things that we find

1146
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,719
with um

1147
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,159
i've been trying to find a good

1148
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,959
phosphorous source that was

1149
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,358
vegan or not animal based and it's it's

1150
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,000
really really hard um

1151
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,078
all the ones i find are also bringing in

1152
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,079
uh heavy metals

1153
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,160
um i sent one sample to you of a soft

1154
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,960
rock phosphate and it came back with you

1155
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,960
know lead levels so how

1156
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,440
one do you know of any great phosphate

1157
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,720
sources that are going to be lower in

1158
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,639
heavy metals

1159
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,838
and then um

1160
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,519
can you talk a little bit more about

1161
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,679
this phosphate

1162
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,039
binding

1163
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,399
yeah also

1164
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:19,440
that's a good question

1165
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,240
on

1166
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,838
sources one thing that came to my mind

1167
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,799
is the

1168
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:29,119
fish bones but it's not i mean you said

1169
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,800
that you wanted it to be vegan or like

1170
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,119
not animal products

1171
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,119
but then yeah it's appetite uh it's a

1172
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,519
traditional uh

1173
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,318
rock mining you know mineral which is

1174
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:44,000
running out so we need looking uh look

1175
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,199
for other phosphate

1176
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,400
um

1177
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,399
sources but

1178
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,000
yeah fish bones would be

1179
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:59,358
non-vegan uh stores which might not have

1180
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:01,759
as much heavy metals as anything else

1181
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,679
otherwise i don't know it's it's hard to

1182
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,520
think um

1183
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,838
i have to think about this one and get

1184
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,280
back to you if i find the resources

1185
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,199
yeah it's

1186
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,280
um typically

1187
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,439
a fungi would help to release phosphorus

1188
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,119
that's in the environment making it more

1189
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,838
accessible for plant uptake

1190
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,519
so

1191
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,480
maybe there will be some mixes with

1192
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:30,480
fungi that could be you

1193
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,480
now i developed more uh

1194
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,358
dr allison justice actually sent me a

1195
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,039
paper a couple years ago out of italy

1196
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:43,119
that showed uh with hemp increased

1197
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:46,800
heavy metal uptake into the hemp biomass

1198
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,400
with the addition of mycorrhizal fungus

1199
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,400
which

1200
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,079
makes sense to me because mycorrhizal

1201
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,200
fungus increases

1202
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,960
the nutrient uptake you know it's most

1203
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:00,000
notably phosphorus

1204
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,000
but um other nutrients as well and so

1205
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,440
they saw higher levels of arsenic with

1206
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,358
um

1207
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
uptake with it which

1208
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,159
which i just thought was interesting

1209
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,200
research

1210
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,358
um

1211
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,679
so i i guess it may be my question

1212
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:16,239
arsenic becomes more arsenic becomes

1213
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:18,480
more available with phosphorus addition

1214
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,639
while lead becomes less available with

1215
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,719
phosphorus addition so that's a paradox

1216
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,039
when both lead and arsenic are present

1217
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,039
in the soil

1218
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,400
yeah i didn't know that phosphorus might

1219
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,800
not be

1220
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,880
yeah so phosphorus might not be

1221
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,680
the best solution if

1222
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,838
soil is contaminated with most lead and

1223
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,598
arsenic

1224
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:42,318
when we did a test

1225
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,519
for heavy metals

1226
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,719
in

1227
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,719
our research in new jersey we tested the

1228
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,159
soil that was contaminated with lead and

1229
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,519
arsenic

1230
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,199
and we

1231
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:54,960
added the different platforms

1232
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,558
fertilizers and we added different

1233
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,760
compost

1234
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,880
and we saw that arsenic was more

1235
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,000
available

1236
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,920
did not

1237
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,519
was not fixed by phosphorus obviously

1238
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,639
because they start

1239
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,199
competing

1240
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:12,239
and arsenic becomes more mobilized but

1241
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,318
compost was a better result for us and

1242
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,399
so though

1243
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:19,039
basically yeah it was more successful as

1244
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,160
a remediation technique compared to

1245
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,159
phosphorus fertilizers

1246
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,359
that's that's really interesting um

1247
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,519
now one thing you mentioned was that

1248
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,838
arsenic is more leachable

1249
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:35,119
than lead how

1250
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:37,599
realistic is it for someone to

1251
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,318
flush their soil or their their their

1252
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,079
media as a way of reducing arsenic

1253
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,719
levels is that going to make a

1254
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,039
significant difference

1255
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:50,078
oh that's an interesting question that

1256
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,079
i'm not capable to enter fully because i

1257
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,960
know there is such thing as an

1258
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,039
industrial washing when like you know

1259
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,800
they do it on a large scale and they can

1260
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,599
wash soil

1261
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,240
uh with water or maybe some other

1262
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,359
solvents that help to remove

1263
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:10,558
heavy metals but i don't know for

1264
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:12,400
if it's sufficient for a person to do it

1265
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,040
i just not something i've seen in

1266
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,280
literature because i never was curious

1267
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,279
about it until now

1268
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,359
that's fair i i appreciate your honesty

1269
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,280
i would think it's not

1270
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,960
very super leachable just because we

1271
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,720
still see it in areas that have heavy

1272
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,639
you know fairly significant rainfall

1273
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,118
right if there was a you know

1274
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,598
exactly precipitation and natural yeah

1275
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,519
so they maybe needed some technologies

1276
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,800
to do that um

1277
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:39,759
yeah to make it more effective

1278
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,519
um

1279
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,520
if it was like nitrates for example then

1280
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:47,039
we would we would know fairly quickly it

1281
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,880
would just disappear into our water um

1282
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,239
yeah i wonder if there's a microbe down

1283
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,039
the road that someone will discover that

1284
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,558
will allow us to tie up these uh heavy

1285
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,358
metals more efficiently that would be a

1286
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,079
really cool invention or uh discovery i

1287
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,078
guess we would say

1288
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,639
yeah i think there are there are

1289
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,480
research um research studies related to

1290
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:09,519
that and

1291
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,039
it looks promising to

1292
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:13,199
just to find some microbes that are

1293
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,759
converting

1294
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:19,279
metals into less available forms or an

1295
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,520
also fungi help to

1296
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,480
convert lead to

1297
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,280
paramorphic and you ask me earlier about

1298
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,838
this

1299
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,280
conversion so what basically happens is

1300
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:32,318
when lead

1301
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:36,240
is exposed to available phosphorus it

1302
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:38,079
combines into paramorphite but you would

1303
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,759
need a lot of phosphorus in the

1304
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,640
environment to combine this light

1305
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,640
efficiently and it will take some time

1306
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:47,118
sometimes maybe a few years it depends

1307
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,759
on the climate and the zone where the

1308
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,160
site is located but the idea here is

1309
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,119
that just lead becomes lead phosphate

1310
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,879
mineral and it's very stable

1311
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,480
and it's not

1312
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,119
or

1313
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,679
not by accessible or has very low by

1314
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:07,119
accessibility so it's not really harmful

1315
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:09,679
uh to people if it gets to human body so

1316
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,480
like let's say a child consumes it it

1317
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:14,000
will just go through the system and

1318
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,440
you know just the child

1319
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,119
poops it out

1320
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,838
and not being

1321
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,640
dissolved in a bloodstream compared to

1322
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:23,838
other source or other forms of

1323
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,960
lead

1324
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:29,119
so paramorphic is really

1325
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,760
good mineral to have but it

1326
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,400
takes time naturally to form it or

1327
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,079
artificially to form it if you want to

1328
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,880
play around in your garden and try to

1329
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:42,000
make this conversion yourself

1330
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:45,519
so when we get a lab test back

1331
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,280
that's not going to tell us the actual

1332
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,000
form of

1333
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,760
the arsenic or the lead so we won't know

1334
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,318
how available this is to our plant we'll

1335
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,480
just know that it's it's present

1336
00:51:54,318 --> 00:52:00,159
in some form

1337
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:03,199
so good question uh there are different

1338
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,519
methods how it's tested

1339
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,519
metals can be measured in total

1340
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,559
concentrations and

1341
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:14,318
phytoavailable concentrations for plants

1342
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,160
and in bioaccessible concentrations

1343
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,039
total concentrations

1344
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,519
it just gives us total numbers of how

1345
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,558
much in total lead or arsenic or cadmium

1346
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,440
in soil

1347
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,800
phyto available those methods are using

1348
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,159
extractions

1349
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,519
to

1350
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:34,159
see how much potentially can be uptaken

1351
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,239
by plant or how much is available at

1352
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,879
least for a plant

1353
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:41,598
uh and it will be lower than total

1354
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,440
concentration typically not all of it is

1355
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,400
going to be available

1356
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,960
this can be found in labs a lot of labs

1357
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,680
testing for

1358
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:54,720
[Music]

1359
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:57,919
phytoavailable nutrients but also metals

1360
00:52:54,719 --> 00:53:00,558
and another question is bioaccessibility

1361
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,358
i've seen only few labs around the

1362
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,519
country who test

1363
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,480
for that

1364
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:11,519
for public it takes

1365
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,519
more effort to

1366
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,558
to do that method and like do sample

1367
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,639
preparation and

1368
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,319
the method is still there are different

1369
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,960
methods how to use it there's an epa

1370
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,639
method there's like european methods

1371
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,199
different authors came up with the

1372
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:29,440
different methods so they're um

1373
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:31,358
hard to say which one is the best

1374
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,639
and it's still a

1375
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:37,279
tricky uh in some ways to assess the by

1376
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:39,838
accessibility because when we do those

1377
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:44,000
extractions we try to mimic

1378
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:46,400
uh gastric solution in the lab condition

1379
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,519
and it's really difficult to predict

1380
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,920
what the human gastric system is

1381
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,759
and you know like

1382
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,039
our

1383
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,040
chemistry of gastric solution changes if

1384
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,279
like before we eat after we eat it will

1385
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:03,519
respond differently potentially on the

1386
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,119
metals we would consume and it's very

1387
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,559
difficult to mimic this in the lab

1388
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,039
conditions that's why there's some

1389
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,280
methods that exist out there and the

1390
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:13,838
labs don't really

1391
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,079
not many labs offer those tests

1392
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:16,960
to public if you get a chance to find a

1393
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,880
lab

1394
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,000
that

1395
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,160
test for by accessibility you should do

1396
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,760
at least several samples for you to get

1397
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:27,759
an idea what numbers you're getting

1398
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,639
okay so it's not very uh cost effective

1399
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,800
necessarily or realistic for the average

1400
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,279
person or grower to

1401
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,798
to find that out yeah i don't know the

1402
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,400
prices

1403
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,480
yeah i don't know if they're like what

1404
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,200
are the prices for them they're just not

1405
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,358
as publicly available tests as i

1406
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:49,598
seen like not every laboratory offers

1407
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,960
that

1408
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,119
okay okay

1409
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,559
um and while you were talking about that

1410
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,318
it got me thinking about one other

1411
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,960
variable that i meant to mention that

1412
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:02,239
we've kind of touched on is uh

1413
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,000
not just uh crop selection in terms of

1414
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:05,759
uh

1415
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,239
variety but also

1416
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,440
our species but also

1417
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,439
um

1418
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,760
cultivar selection so the amount of

1419
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,798
genetic diversity we see in cannabis is

1420
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,640
is

1421
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:17,440
huge it's it's much larger than any

1422
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:19,519
other

1423
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,798
you know ornamental vegetable crop that

1424
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,838
anyone would grow

1425
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,480
so

1426
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:27,279
we found that certain genetics

1427
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,240
will uptake heavy metals much more

1428
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,160
efficiently than others so just because

1429
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,239
one genetic fails doesn't mean that

1430
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,759
other ones will fail in that same soil

1431
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:39,759
so that's just one other factor i mean

1432
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,680
there's so many variables here when it

1433
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,799
comes to heavy metal uptake that you've

1434
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:48,399
that you've touched on um

1435
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:50,639
it's just it's alone in the future

1436
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,760
yes it is it's complicated

1437
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,598
yes

1438
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,119
so um

1439
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,640
is there anything else that you would

1440
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,480
like to share before we sign off in

1441
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:01,679
regards to um your research or upcoming

1442
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,838
research that you're really excited

1443
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,838
about

1444
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
well

1445
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,680
uh currently i am working on the soul

1446
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,559
survey for heavy metals in louisiana but

1447
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:16,798
i always welcome samples from around the

1448
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,640
country it's really interesting to see

1449
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:21,039
what people are getting in their soils

1450
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:22,639
or amendments or fertilizer so lab is

1451
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:23,599
open to

1452
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,838
other

1453
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,798
people from across the country to send

1454
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:28,798
the samples to us

1455
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,119
i continue studying heavy metals in a

1456
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,880
different form and shape and my current

1457
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,680
research also involves

1458
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,079
using uh magnetism so magnetism to

1459
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,838
understand how that may correlate with

1460
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,680
heavy metals and also

1461
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:50,159
find the way to

1462
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:53,440
make methods even

1463
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:56,000
less time consuming even more affordable

1464
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,480
so we're still working on developing the

1465
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,920
best methodology possible and hopefully

1466
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,920
in the future we'll be able to

1467
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:08,480
offer the by accessibility tests with

1468
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:12,880
the xrf so we are still working on that

1469
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:15,199
to make it through portable technology

1470
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,160
so yeah basically if people want to send

1471
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,558
their soils to the lab feel free to send

1472
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:22,798
them to our website

1473
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,640
or just google delta urban sales

1474
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:27,119
laboratory

1475
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:29,759
and they will find information on how to

1476
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,880
collect their samples and where to mail

1477
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,200
them to

1478
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,599
um and if they want to

1479
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:38,399
look at my research i also have my

1480
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,400
website it's

1481
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,400
um annapeltsava.com my instagram soil

1482
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,838
under school expert i love chatting with

1483
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,960
different people and i'm always

1484
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,719
responding my instagram so i'm really

1485
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,440
pleased to hear

1486
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:56,399
what people experiences in their gardens

1487
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,760
and homes around the country

1488
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,440
absolutely i'm glad you brought those up

1489
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,280
because i was going to list all of those

1490
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,440
things and i'll have them in the

1491
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,760
introduction as well and on the podcast

1492
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,119
page because

1493
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,839
it might be a little tricky to spell

1494
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,798
your last name for people unfamiliar um

1495
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,318
but but i highly suggest people uh

1496
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,480
do check out your social media you're

1497
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:19,039
quite active on there

1498
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,519
and you just recently posted i i saw a

1499
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,920
story where you were showing exactly how

1500
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,759
you do the testing on the heavy metal

1501
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,200
analysis which i thought was fascinating

1502
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,160
it's wonderful to actually see what's

1503
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,279
happening

1504
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:30,239
in a lab

1505
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,000
and

1506
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,919
you're just you're very interesting mix

1507
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,838
of

1508
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,119
you know fashion and soil science which

1509
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:40,719
you don't typically put together um so i

1510
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,000
think it's a lot of fun and people

1511
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,239
should definitely

1512
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,119
check you out

1513
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:49,358
thank you so much i appreciate that you

1514
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,440
reach out to me invited to the podcast

1515
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,838
and i'm excited to

1516
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,679
collaborate more different projects test

1517
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,599
more of your samples and be engaged with

1518
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,598
the audience

1519
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,599
yeah i i we definitely will be sending

1520
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,200
you a lot more samples as we try to
