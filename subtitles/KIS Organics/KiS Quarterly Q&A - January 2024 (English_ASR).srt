00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:21,679
Tad Hy owner of Kiss Organics um I host

3
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,399
a Canabis cultivation science podcast I

4
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,079
got started because my parents owned a

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,879
plant nursery growing up and um then my

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,639
father when they sold that after 30

7
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,399
years they started comp te business I've

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,759
been around sort of plants and soil

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,200
biology pretty much my whole life I came

10
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,359
into it after coming back from Australia

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,120
with a master's degree I got back into

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,679
the business and uh kind of been going

13
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,839
from there and I think uh the most

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,280
exciting thing for me is the opportunity

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,719
to always learn more with a new crop

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,520
which is cannabis that's really exciting

17
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,480
and the idea that we might be able to

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,399
bridge the gap between the research

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,479
that's happening right now in Academia

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,478
and what's going going on in the field

21
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,879
in cultivation uh with Growers so that's

22
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,640
uh I think that's the biggest challenge

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,438
and also the most exciting thing is like

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,280
we can actually participate in actively

25
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,959
learning more about this crop and that's

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,560
there's very few crops left that we can

27
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:21,319
say that about so that's it for me thank

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,840
you who'd like to go

29
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:28,000
next Brandon I yeah I can go um I'm

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,399
Brandon Hudson I work for kiss Organics

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,599
I do the bulk of the soil analys is

32
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:37,680
um I love cannabis I I I've I've I've

33
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,199
been around this plant my whole life my

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,159
parents grew weed um I had a teepee when

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,920
I was four made out of stocks from a

36
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,439
harvest so I've been around it my whole

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,399
life um I was talking to Tad's dad

38
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,599
yesterday I've just never had any kind

39
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,200
of uncomfortability about it or anything

40
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,158
it was just something that was like salt

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,840
and pepper in my environment growing up

42
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,560
and so you know it was it was always the

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,680
constant reminders don't tell anybody

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,159
and um so I've been growing uh as an

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,080
adult on my own for 39 years now this is

46
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,318
my 39th year and um I I've done deep

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,160
water

48
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:21,439
culture rock wool slabs cocoa all the

49
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:25,000
salt stuff and you know coliseums all

50
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,280
that um I've done large scale facilities

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,400
in South Carolina with with hemp both

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
indoor and

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,120
outdoor um

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,158
I would say the biggest challenge for

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:43,158
Organics would um heavy metals you know

56
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:47,479
we when we look at numbers that small

57
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:51,719
parts per billion we look at the almost

58
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:54,840
infinite number of opportunities for

59
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,598
um some sort of contamination along the

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,759
way in the testing uh even after the

61
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,280
sample's been looked at so um

62
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,479
that I I feel like getting some

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,840
real uh

64
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,959
National guidelines for how that should

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,439
be done properly how the testing should

66
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,360
be done properly um the the water all

67
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,079
that kind of stuff I feel like that's

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,040
the biggest challenge for

69
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,239
us cool Andrew like that hat Brandon I

70
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,840
had to represent man I'm trying to cover

71
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,680
up the six head so I don't blind anybody

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,680
so

73
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:40,480
um so I started growing

74
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:44,878
maybe 14 years ago in Alaska um I moved

75
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:48,158
to Alaska and I had just been getting um

76
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:52,560
really good Blue Dream from Cali medical

77
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:54,438
scene and then when I went to Alaska um

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,158
not as much Imports up there and the

79
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:59,039
people that I knew did not know how to

80
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,560
grow so very quickly we realized if we

81
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,919
were going to get good stuff we were

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,319
gonna have to grow it

83
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,438
ourselves um first uh apartment someone

84
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:10,119
just brought over a bunch of plants I

85
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:13,318
threw a light into a closet I was doing

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,199
Pete Moss and compost teas and some B

87
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:19,000
guano teas and then um we got evicted

88
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,079
from that apartment for growing and so I

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,720
ended up realizing I had to rent a house

90
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,000
then we got into a house and started

91
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,400
um getting some cool genetics over from

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Amsterdam and uh some of the stuff in

93
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:35,198
the

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,639
overseas like Attitude seed bank and um

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,520
you know then I started to realize how

96
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,240
important genetics were because the

97
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,159
first time I ever grew I think it was

98
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,600
choc Lou crossed with kosher kush um it

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,479
was just a part of anything I'd ever

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,960
smoked before and uh I knew I wasn't

101
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,000
that good at growing so it had to be

102
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,478
something else and then slowly but

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,439
surely just kind of Switched craft and

104
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,038
went more and more organic organic um

105
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,879
less bottled nutrients until uh I

106
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,478
actually learned how to grow in living

107
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,159
soil through Tad's podcast and then um

108
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,199
ended up meeting Tad and coming to work

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,880
for the business so it's been a it's

110
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,879
been a great ride and I think my biggest

111
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:24,240
um struggles over the years was learning

112
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:26,959
how to water in living soil um it's so

113
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
different when you switch from a sterile

114
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,918
media um I'd always had great success

115
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:35,839
with bottles and then my first grow um I

116
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:40,120
overwatered pretty bad in living

117
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,119
Organics and the the plants just looked

118
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,400
horrible good thank you and and Ben I've

119
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,799
seen them lately they don't look

120
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,799
horrible

121
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,800
anymore yeah uh my name's Ben um it's

122
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,478
kind of funny I I spent a lot of time

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,079
learning about stuff so I haven't

124
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:00,639
actually grown too much I actually

125
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,839
didn't even jump into this industry

126
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,240
until about

127
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,119
2018 and before that time I was

128
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,000
legitimately underwater I was scuba

129
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,560
diving and hanging out with my eels and

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,720
doing my research on Marine

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,478
ecology so uh long story short we moved

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,960
up into the Olympia area um my

133
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:23,038
brother-in-law at the time uh still does

134
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,000
but is expanded owns a tier 2

135
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,000
cultivation facility and I called him up

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,839
and I said hey I'm looking for a gig but

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,240
in the meantime would you like

138
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,719
scientific eye on any of this stuff and

139
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,240
he said well that doesn't exist

140
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,720
currently in the industry so sure so I

141
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,879
was like okay and then uh I took a year

142
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,800
essentially of just keeping my mouth

143
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,839
shut acting like a gardener learning the

144
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,400
plant learning the system um I was a bit

145
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,598
lucky with the fact that they do uh grow

146
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,918
in living soil um organic sustainable

147
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,199
kind of approach and that soil was Kiss

148
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,079
organic

149
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,879
that's how I kind of met Tad um it was

150
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,240
actually pretty funny I remember when

151
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,840
Nate and I were talking the owner of

152
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,120
gold leaf he was like yeah I'd love to

153
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,560
have you up here but you you know you

154
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,560
gotta kind of have an idea of what's

155
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,519
going on so if you could this while I

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,160
was still living and working in Santa

157
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:21,240
Cruz he said yeah take a listen to this

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,879
podcast uh it's by a friend of mine

159
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,038
named uh Tad hussy and so I at that time

160
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,840
I was still in Academia so I have a a

161
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,159
whole booklet of just all the notes from

162
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,918
all those first I don't know 30 40 50

163
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,319
episodes and I was just trying to study

164
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:40,240
and learn like I knew how and then yeah

165
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,879
um I started really kind of getting into

166
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,680
the growing in

167
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:49,759
2018 um my kind of soap box flash

168
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,199
feeling about cannabis is uh funny

169
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,038
enough I think it's going to be one of

170
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,720
the main crops that saves agriculture I

171
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,680
know that sounds kind of hyperbolic but

172
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,599
um we're lucky enough to have a crop

173
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,959
that's got so much margin that we can

174
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:08,959
really play with stuff um whether that's

175
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,519
irrigation lighting you know all these

176
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,719
other things a lot of other Industries

177
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:16,918
don't have that kind of margin

178
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,680
to really push and test the limits um so

179
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,318
I think when things start getting more

180
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,680
complicated as far as

181
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,280
growing kind of crops Outdoors that

182
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,639
we've normally done um I think people

183
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,519
are going to have to look at how to do

184
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,759
things indoors

185
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,439
and those who want to do things

186
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,839
sustainably and organically will have a

187
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,279
very logical place to look and that's

188
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,399
folks like us um the hardest thing about

189
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:45,080
growing cannabis this was something that

190
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:48,559
I wrestled with doing during my learning

191
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,040
my heavy learning phase which is um

192
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,958
especially coming out of a place that

193
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,879
was always looking for primary

194
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:58,000
literature um trying to find empirical

195
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,919
data and research about cultivation

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,919
practices is

197
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,719
it just doesn't exist it's starting to

198
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,838
now um sure like medicinal and you know

199
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,360
psycho effects like there's plenty of

200
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,640
research on that but actually how to

201
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,159
benefit the plant more and get you know

202
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,559
more holistic properties out of it um

203
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,838
there's very little on that so that was

204
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,000
frustrating but it was also very

205
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,440
exciting where we got of get to you know

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,440
Forge that road um and do it so it's

207
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,480
been fascinating it's been exciting very

208
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,680
rarely I feel very lucky to have landed

209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,039
in an industry

210
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,599
that you know doesn't have a whole lot

211
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,519
of previous work on it so um it's it's

212
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,920
great it's super exciting and I'm feel

213
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,159
really lucky to have landed where where

214
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:46,799
I am thank you Ben um so we have another

215
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:50,480
question from Margaret um she asks what

216
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:53,759
cultivars do you prefer to grow and why

217
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,639
and how do you find determine then test

218
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,759
out cultivars um it's probably a good

219
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,399
one for Andrew and Brandon so um

220
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,480
Andrew would you like to

221
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,200
start um yeah or Brandon can go my my

222
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,680
answer might get pretty long here this

223
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,839
is kind of like my uh my jam to my

224
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,838
peanut butter all right okay sounds good

225
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:19,120
yeah I I can I can give my short answer

226
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:22,720
and then Andrew can elucidate on that

227
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,919
um I'm primarily growing

228
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,639
indoor so that is a huge Factor just

229
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,799
immediately right out the gate for what

230
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,639
cultivars I'm gonna grow you know you

231
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,359
have to look for something that is a

232
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,919
manageable struct structure and time

233
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,720
length based on your environment so you

234
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:46,039
know you always want to match the hatch

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,839
and so if you're gonna if you're in

236
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,360
Southern California and you want to grow

237
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
some Haze plants outside that makes

238
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,639
perfect sense to me you'll have a long

239
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,078
enough season you'll have the right

240
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,159
weather probably kind of what Ben was

241
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,359
alluding to earlier like we're going to

242
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,399
be indoor for growing eventually it just

243
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,919
the weather's getting just too

244
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:12,440
unpredictable um but so with me you know

245
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:16,599
I I'm trying to be able to provide

246
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,519
information and support for facilities

247
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,120
most of those facilities need an eight

248
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,720
or a nine week production plant so a lot

249
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,078
of my decisions are are made so that I

250
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,000
can support The Growers so I stick to

251
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:32,638
you know those eight nine week plants

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,559
for the most part um there's there's

253
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:39,399
some stuff like GMO there's some hazes

254
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,719
that um I love they just take too long

255
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,639
so that is a situation where it might be

256
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,360
worth it for me to grow one plant

257
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,039
outdoor pull tarps on it something like

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,919
that but for the most part I'm looking

259
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:55,078
for something that will finish on time

260
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,759
and something that has a short structure

261
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,078
but gives me the yields that I'm looking

262
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,360
for and then beyond that it's just a

263
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:08,439
matter of personal taste um some people

264
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,639
like the you know the real sedative

265
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,639
couch lock stuff that I don't really

266
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,480
enjoy that I I I don't I'm already

267
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:19,759
hungry and tired I don't need more of

268
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,159
that in my life so um I I like energetic

269
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:26,480
laughy uh communicative strains I like

270
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,639
strains that um I can do math on I like

271
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,320
strains that um

272
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,240
I hate to say it but it's really hard to

273
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,760
get high I just you know I I smoke too

274
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,159
much and so I've got a really high

275
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:45,360
tolerance and so I'm really looking

276
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:47,719
for Tarpin I I just it's a piece of

277
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,320
candy it's just like it's candy

278
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,560
throughout the day that I just love the

279
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,440
taste of it um I feel like I can smell

280
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,679
good cannabis and it just changes my

281
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,320
mood um just that just being in a room

282
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,719
with a bunch of good cannabis I was at a

283
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,680
harvest yesterday Tangi turps for days

284
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,240
you know as far as as far as you could

285
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,919
smell it was just Tangy turps and it was

286
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,320
great you know and I did you know I

287
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,799
didn't even feel like smoking I was just

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,720
in a great mood and um so yeah so for me

289
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,599
I'm trying to basically I'm I'm trying

290
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,000
to match my environment I want to find

291
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,959
something that fits the space I can get

292
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,159
an adequate yield um and we're always

293
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:29,319
looking for I love Justin McGill's dad's

294
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,240
like three-step joint process of like he

295
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,639
likes to take a dry to and get that just

296
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,600
that pure turpine then he said he likes

297
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,919
to light it but he'll just light it like

298
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,519
this he won't draw through it because he

299
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,559
say he likes to do the wave test like as

300
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,759
though he's at a concert he's like I

301
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:51,599
want I want to have that best smelling

302
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:55,360
weed in the concert and um so I I you

303
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,399
know I don't tend personally to pick for

304
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,519
medicinal value although I do use

305
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,278
cannabis for for pain P management I've

306
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,278
broken most of the bones in my body and

307
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,480
um it helps with migraines it helps with

308
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,720
all that stuff for me but I'm not

309
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,879
specifically chasing any one medicinal

310
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,879
canono profile or anything like

311
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,399
that can I just add something really

312
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,120
small to that

313
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,278
um one one other consideration to think

314
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,679
about is we know that there's certain

315
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,159
plants that now have genes that will

316
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,239
make them more resistant to powdery

317
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,120
mildew for example or when you go into a

318
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,120
commercial room you'll see some plants

319
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,360
that that won't Express H and vroid but

320
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,879
others will and so because of the

321
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,039
genetic variability in cannabis um

322
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,639
selecting plants that are better for

323
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,240
your environment like Brandon alluded at

324
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,000
can can go a long ways towards finishing

325
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,959
I mean here in Washington with all the

326
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,639
rains we get Outdoors is really

327
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,518
challenging so um that's just something

328
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,759
that I want to always keep in the back

329
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,839
of my mind when I'm picking what

330
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,440
genetics I'm gonna run yeah yeah and

331
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,240
just to Dove tail back into what tad

332
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,120
just said if I go into a

333
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,240
room and there's you know like I was in

334
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,078
a room yesterday with probably 12

335
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,039
different Cult of ours big big room

336
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,838
and let's say 11 of them are are doing

337
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,879
great and one of them's for whatever

338
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,920
reason you're seeing a trace element

339
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:31,519
issue or I think it's the white star dog

340
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,639
over at moo that always finishes with a

341
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,240
manganese very visible manganese issue

342
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,600
for me if I've got a plant that's I

343
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,198
mean it would have to be real roadkill

344
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,560
skunk you know it would have to be like

345
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,838
one of the Holy Grail cultivars that's

346
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:52,518
gone now for me to be willing

347
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,839
to deal with or baby a a cultivar that

348
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,839
was you know not responding well within

349
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,279
the average targets that we that we work

350
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,959
with so that's another consideration I

351
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:05,919
if I have outliers that just don't

352
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:08,278
perform well in my environment my mpk

353
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,799
whatever I'll I'll get rid of

354
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:15,360
them Andre do you want to jump

355
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,639
in um so I'm a little bit unique um most

356
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,399
people with

357
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,639
my kind of disposition towards cannabis

358
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,600
don't enjoy it um but I'm very very

359
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,560
sensitive to sedative effects kind of

360
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,560
like what Brandon was saying I I wake up

361
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,919
tired and hungry I don't need any help

362
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,838
in that in that

363
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,958
department um so for me I'm looking for

364
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,440
things that really invigorate

365
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:44,599
and uh seeming to help with

366
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,440
creativity um inspirational motivational

367
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,879
things

368
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,800
um uh things of that sort and then along

369
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:56,039
with some kind of overall feeling of

370
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,278
Wellness or like he said like Giggles or

371
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,000
you know if I can determine that then

372
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,480
that's usually what I'm looking for in a

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,679
cultivar but what I found is I the

374
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,880
modern-day genetics don't usually offer

375
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,600
that for me if something is going to

376
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,520
flower in 8 to nine

377
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:17,000
weeks um it almost

378
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,879
always uh leaves me dragging so um I

379
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,480
personally prefer combinations of land

380
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,160
race and what I would call legendary

381
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,519
varieties varieties that just have

382
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,798
outstanding flavor resin

383
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:33,519
production um varieties that have stayed

384
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:38,599
and stuck around uh through all the

385
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:40,599
different um hype kind of cycles that

386
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:44,798
that cannabis goes through for example

387
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:46,558
um chem 91 and Congo lease or the any

388
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,440
African really I love the different

389
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:52,160
African varieties um but the chem 91

390
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,038
cross with Congo they just go very well

391
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,880
together the African land race provides

392
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:59,599
a unique energetic almost heart racing

393
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,120
sensation while the chem adds a certain

394
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,959
potency and flavor um just mix really

395
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,519
well together and it levels out the chem

396
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,840
so the chem doesn't take you under if

397
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,558
you smoke too often but at the same

398
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,480
time

399
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,440
um the African can be too intense for

400
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,400
some people and they don't want to

401
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:25,440
feel that like hot heart racing

402
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,480
sensation um I have to admit I like the

403
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Speedy paranoid side of weed so I'm just

404
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,120
tell on myself I like that so no me too

405
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,759
I don't like if if uh if I smoke I want

406
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,678
to like go for a walk or like like you

407
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,359
said go do some math or like maybe even

408
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,880
think about the next uh cross I want to

409
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,199
make or what genetics I think are going

410
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,000
to go good together but if my mind is

411
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:55,400
hindered or I just feel overall

412
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,480
lethargic um it's not fun for me and so

413
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,120
um another thing I love are hazes for

414
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,880
that very reason a haze is one of the

415
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:07,639
very few cultivars that already has

416
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,039
potency and almost a spiritual effect

417
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,120
mixed with some kind of psychedelic high

418
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:16,119
it's ve hazes are very different from

419
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:18,319
anything I've ever smoked um and then me

420
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,639
and Brandon have also found that when

421
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:23,720
Sour Diesel is mixed in with the true

422
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,520
Haze genetic um just the flower

423
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,038
structure increases the smells are way

424
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,519
better the flavor is off the s um it's

425
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:33,960
really hard

426
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,558
to come up with something that does

427
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,079
better than a sour diesel Haze um so

428
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,879
those are things like I would keep in my

429
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,359
garden forever and then I like to

430
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,080
experiment with other land race

431
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,879
varieties just to see what it is like

432
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,720
personally I've found Pakistani crossed

433
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,360
with

434
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:58,000
Honduras um crossed with Congo will give

435
00:19:53,359 --> 00:20:01,439
you almost a psychedelic Haze effect but

436
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,640
it's much more like a soft Daydream and

437
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,360
then it can just totally blot Out hours

438
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,960
from your day so for me it's really cool

439
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,798
it's a really unique experience it

440
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,480
doesn't get heavy but I don't always

441
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:19,558
grow that because I don't want to lose

442
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,079
hours of my day um good one for like a

443
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,079
will do that amnesia amnesia hay will do

444
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,599
that to you like six hours later you're

445
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,639
like I know I did something but I don't

446
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,319
know what with

447
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,400
who yeah so it was pretty fun I'm sure

448
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:38,678
it was fun trying to to find the balance

449
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,200
between

450
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,559
um something like Amnesia Haze where

451
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,000
it's like your whole day is gone and

452
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:49,558
then something like um Honduras where

453
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,558
it's like two hours are gone and it's it

454
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,879
can be good and functional for a Sunday

455
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,639
when you don't have to get anything done

456
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,440
um but I'm not going to grow it time and

457
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,120
time again because it doesn't have the

458
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:07,640
same energetic productivity like um an

459
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:09,439
African mixed with a haze W um and then

460
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,200
when I'm hunting seeds like how do I

461
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,759
find determine test out a cultivar I'm a

462
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:20,960
huge fan of micro breeding so I always

463
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:24,240
run tiny pots first so if you're um

464
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,720
looking to really stess out a population

465
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,558
micro breeding is very useful or if

466
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,919
you're looking to let's say hunt 12

467
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:34,639
different cultivars and you have 12

468
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,120
seeds of each you can do all that at one

469
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,038
time in a 4x4 tent and then you can look

470
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,719
at these different variations and once

471
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,919
you put them against the whole

472
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,440
population a lot easier to see a

473
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:51,320
standout whereas if you're only growing

474
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,519
four plants in a bed and you have

475
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:56,519
800,000 seeds to work through it's going

476
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,278
to take the rest of your life and each

477
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,278
seed is like a lottery ticket so you

478
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:03,720
might not find anything worthwhile and

479
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,000
you might think you found something cool

480
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,839
when really that's not even what that

481
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,440
line has to offer um you just had a

482
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,319
really good grow so um of course a plant

483
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,320
is going to look great and and smell

484
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:19,038
great if your grow is on point um which

485
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,599
is why are you flowering all those out

486
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,919
like immediately and then revegging them

487
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,000
or are you like growing them enough to

488
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,720
clone them then and then because like if

489
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,159
you just flower it out don't leave

490
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,960
anything to Red you're going to lose

491
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:35,400
that right ideally um you would clone

492
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,319
before flower but okay if you're low on

493
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,320
space and all you have to work with is a

494
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:45,599
4x4 t0 you can rev you just have to do

495
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:48,240
what I call a quick flip if you take

496
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,599
them more than two or three weeks in

497
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,079
depending on the variety it's going to

498
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,038
be very hard to bring them back out but

499
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,720
if you have an eye for it and you can

500
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:58,599
determine a few characteristics that

501
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,120
you're looking for you can call out a

502
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:04,839
lot of the population in that first two

503
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,959
weeks just based on your runs uh things

504
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,038
that are like Brandon said showing a

505
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,600
random

506
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,400
deficiency um things that just don't

507
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,558
want to get going things that don't

508
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,480
stretch at all or things that too much

509
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:20,678
um you can really see a lot in the first

510
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:24,319
two weeks of flour and then when you

511
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:27,559
bring them back you can up pot let's say

512
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,359
you go from 200 down to 20 after those

513
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:32,359
first two weeks it's a lot more

514
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:35,519
manageable to clone the LA the resulting

515
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:37,278
20 plants and then continue testing

516
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,679
further on so you can at least pick out

517
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:42,480
your girls in a type of structure that

518
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,240
you want and then you can dig back in

519
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,000
and really look for that Stand Out Among

520
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,480
those 20 maybe let's say one gallon pots

521
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
or a bed um I saw really interesting

522
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,880
yesterday just on the r topic So

523
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,679
Justin's been running this grapefruit

524
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,760
strain for over a decade and they they

525
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,720
re they used to revet revet revet and

526
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,919
it's at a point now where it will only

527
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,798
throw on three leaves no matter how

528
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,360
mature the plant gets no matter how big

529
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,200
the mom gets and so they're actually

530
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,839
going back through tissue

531
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,038
culture

532
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,879
to I guess reverse that so that the

533
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,960
plant will grow properly and that's

534
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,640
that's how they're going to get around

535
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,600
it so I just thought that was really

536
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,919
interesting because I've always had

537
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,599
pretty good results luck with um reving

538
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,559
plants but in a perfect world I prefer

539
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:38,558
to take label all the moms take cuts off

540
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:41,119
of them I've got my cuts flower the moms

541
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,599
out then you know decide who I want to

542
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,000
keep and and I never

543
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,038
I i' I've kind of fallen in love with

544
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,440
this super silver haze Sour Diesel but I

545
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:53,240
try not to fall in love with any one

546
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,679
cultivar I you know I just threw that

547
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,679
whole pillowcase full of seeds out there

548
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,519
just to show like I've got a lot of

549
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:06,840
genetics like I've got millions of beans

550
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:11,319
and so I'm always popping something new

551
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:15,119
always hey Brandon can I ask a question

552
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:16,319
yeah yeah hey um why would you okay so

553
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,278
if you're you're you're popping your

554
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,240
seeds and you've got your mom's why

555
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,278
would you um flower out the mom and keep

556
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,839
a pet why wouldn't you keep the mom and

557
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,919
flower out of

558
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:30,678
cut you could do either way you could do

559
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:33,759
either way I a lot like in my when my

560
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,038
facility I had a 3,000 foot head house

561
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:40,679
that was always super short for space

562
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:43,519
and I had a 60 by 120 Greenhouse that

563
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,640
there was always you know I had roll so

564
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:51,480
I had most you know I had like was like

565
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:55,240
88% 92% of the floor was accounted for

566
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:58,480
but I still had big a on either end and

567
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,720
so I would just drag a mom over and and

568
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,038
flower her out that way I'd get a big

569
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,519
yield you know it's a nice big healthy

570
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,359
plant I don't have to worry about it

571
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,119
since it's not sitting in the best

572
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,879
environment like you don't want to Stack

573
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,959
a bunch of young sensitive plants in

574
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,840
front of the wet wall in South Carolina

575
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,960
like I I got you yeah yeah I've just

576
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,119
heard some people say you know some um

577
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,519
conflicting things about you should you

578
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,798
should you should always flower out the

579
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,879
mom and and keep a cut and I've always

580
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:29,639
been accustomed to keeping the mom the

581
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,159
actual um know the seed stock the mom

582
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,600
and um flowering cuts off of that so

583
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,360
that's a question the mom is seed stock

584
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,398
she's going to have the F1 Vigor which

585
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:41,678
typically means she's you know GNA stick

586
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:44,798
around but I don't keep my mom's

587
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,600
for probably three months I six months

588
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,519
is the max but I think three months is

589
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,199
probably better just to

590
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:55,398
keep propagation numbers up and that

591
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,038
kind of stuff you're not car load or

592
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:59,639
something along with it so I just think

593
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,558
that that that works a little bit better

594
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,320
for me which you could do either and

595
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,398
then like I don't know at the uh this

596
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,558
was months ago but I had a thing on

597
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:12,038
Instagram and I don't know if we did it

598
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:14,398
on here or not but I was showing where I

599
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:16,519
took a bunch of cuts and immediately

600
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:19,398
threw them into 1212 so I was rooting

601
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:22,200
under 1212 but I also got to

602
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:25,239
see you know I sexed all my my

603
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,759
Greenhouse run that way so there's just

604
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,798
there's you know there's so many ways to

605
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,599
get there with this plant you know it's

606
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,960
just gotta yeah cuz the mom is first

607
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:40,000
generation the first cut that comes off

608
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,798
the second generation right well it it

609
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,440
depends some people you know I got a

610
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:48,519
buddy in Detroit who at this point has

611
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,159
had this lights plant for like 37 years

612
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,919
he's had the same

613
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:59,159
mom wow horrible idea to veg a plant for

614
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:01,919
37 years like yeah

615
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,360
I mean good on him like that's

616
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,720
incredible that he's been able to keep

617
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,678
that PL alive but I just I don't think

618
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,720
that's smart but I think must be he's

619
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:15,519
romantically in love with this

620
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,960
plant must be like Oak at this point

621
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,720
yeah well oh oh this it's like this big

622
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,038
around yeah and it's probably you

623
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,240
probably couldn't drive a nail through

624
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:26,960
it oh no no I mean the number of times

625
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,000
he's had to chop it off it's like eight

626
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,440
feet tall but I mean it just it look

627
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,240
like like a it's like a stump and then

628
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,640
like a porcupine it's crazy that's crazy

629
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,480
this sounds like an urban myth man like

630
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,159
one of those stories you hear no I oh

631
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,798
yeah no I I'll have to I'll reach out to

632
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,640
him and get some pictures because that

633
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:52,359
be cool that would be

634
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:56,399
awesome this guy he uh I met him at a uh

635
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:58,158
Bob Weir Show in Detroit in like

636
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,798
95

637
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,760
and um right after I had been attacked

638
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,839
by a giant Pink dragon that came out of

639
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:08,158
the

640
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:10,720
sunset yeah yeah so he he uh he saved me

641
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,440
that night I had I got a really crazy

642
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,399
story I don't think I should record but

643
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,399
I I'll bring it

644
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,080
up on Hangout story go ahead then then I

645
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,278
want to add something but go ahead yeah

646
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,678
I'll was just going to throw in there I

647
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:27,440
don't know again like I don't know if um

648
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,080
if there's too much interest in like the

649
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,278
facility side of things as opposed to

650
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,480
just like your own personal like grow

651
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:37,440
and exploration but uh a little context

652
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,798
from the facility side of things um I

653
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,360
guess the commercial is we're always

654
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:44,679
seed testing we're always pheno hunting

655
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:47,079
because if you stop moving in this

656
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,159
industry you're you're behind

657
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:53,278
yesterday so um if you do have some

658
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,039
space it's really fun to do um obviously

659
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,000
as long as you're not going to be you

660
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:00,119
know putting any stress or strain or

661
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,278
pollen on the stuff you don't want it on

662
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:06,119
but um as far as like figuring out like

663
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:07,599
you know for us too then from a facility

664
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,558
standpoint like we need to try to do

665
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,599
this as quick as possible um and just

666
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,119
getting to that flowering stage to

667
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,959
figure out if it's a male or female can

668
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:19,278
take a long time and use up a bunch of

669
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,278
resources that theoretically 50% of

670
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,640
those plants will end up dying anyway so

671
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,519
we do sell these Leaf Works kits these

672
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,919
gender kits um in fact I'll throw them

673
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:33,240
into the chat right now link to the

674
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,080
website if you're curious um so that way

675
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,399
you basically just take a little

676
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:41,240
leaf smoosh Leaf in there and then send

677
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,359
it and mail it in and uh they'll get

678
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,159
back to you and went and let you know if

679
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,558
you got a male or a female well before

680
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,799
you need to take that thing all the way

681
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:52,599
to flower to figure it out on your own

682
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:54,879
um so it helps that process a lot faster

683
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,678
early on and that way you don't have to

684
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,480
have as much space in your veg or your

685
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:03,480
pheno hun space right because you can

686
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,480
weed those out no pun intended um a lot

687
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:10,398
quicker had 100% with them yeah only

688
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:13,278
I've used them the only thing I've ever

689
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:16,079
had happen is I did have one plant Herm

690
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:20,919
that I said but that's not the Test's

691
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:23,038
fault that the test read correctly so

692
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,679
yeah since we're talking about moms I

693
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,879
know there was another question about

694
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,840
moms in general in terms of how to best

695
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,320
keep them and what size container and

696
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,240
some of that I thought that might be a

697
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:37,200
good transition um and and like you guys

698
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,919
touched on the Woody stems is a big

699
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,759
thing over time these plants every time

700
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,759
you take a cut you know you're gonna end

701
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,319
up with more offshoots and it just

702
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:48,038
becomes a a nightmare over time of a of

703
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,319
a plant um plus I think the the health

704
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:52,519
of the plant and the viability of the

705
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:55,759
plant goes down uh over time with just

706
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,839
continual wounding and pruning um when

707
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,720
we talk about a long time but uh in

708
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,638
terms of how people are storing these

709
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,038
plants most of the facilities we work

710
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:09,199
with are organic so um most of them are

711
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:11,240
in a range of containers ranging from

712
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,360
I've seen them as small seven gallon

713
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,278
typically 20 or 30 gallon pots uh

714
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,558
Collective elevation if you go check out

715
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:21,119
that tour on YouTube they did it they

716
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:25,119
did two plants in a 4 by8 bed with a

717
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,638
trellis and it looks awesome um I I

718
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,918
don't know if the workflow on that is

719
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:30,038
better but but I have to say it's one of

720
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,360
the coolest looking mom rooms I've ever

721
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:35,240
seen um so you should definitely check

722
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,918
that out but the The Challenge on the

723
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,079
fertility side with moms is what I

724
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,759
wanted to touch on before you guys jump

725
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:45,319
in and that's that's really interesting

726
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,759
because you know a lot of us with the

727
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,439
with the soil beds you know the way that

728
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,278
we like to grow a kiss with with beds

729
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,200
and reimen the soil with soil testing

730
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,079
every cycle that's really challenging

731
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,919
with moms especially if you keep moms

732
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,720
for more than a cycle or two because

733
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,240
it's uh one there's not going to be a

734
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,839
lot of soil left in that pot it's be

735
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,960
mostly root mass and two managing to

736
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:09,959
fortil in that pond with top dressing is

737
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,679
really challenging um in terms of

738
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,840
keeping that Mom healthy and and healthy

739
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,000
moms is the most important thing for

740
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,798
your facility uh having success and even

741
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,519
for hom Growers and having Success

742
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,398
Through flour is starting with like a

743
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,960
really healthy clone if I don't have a

744
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:28,879
healthy Mom I'm not going to start my

745
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,798
next cycle uh it's that important

746
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,679
um that's where little things like uh

747
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:37,720
fish

748
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,919
hydracy um a bottle nutrient program

749
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,120
with light doses com in really handy or

750
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,519
um even something like Jacks like a

751
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,918
conventional salt based fertilizer in

752
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:51,038
small doses uh those things are all just

753
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,480
really effective ways to keep your mom's

754
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,679
healthy I would much rather you know for

755
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,720
example run jacks or use a bottle of

756
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,919
Nutri UT line to make sure I'm keeping

757
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,000
my fertility up in that 30-gon pot my

758
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,278
mom looks healthy then madly trying to

759
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,679
top dress as I see deficiencies knowing

760
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,039
that they're not going to get into the

761
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,240
plant for another seven to 10 days and

762
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,679
now my plant's stressed and I'm gonna

763
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,759
have to take cuting off of it so it

764
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,358
becomes a

765
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,000
real hassle and it's to me it's not

766
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,319
worth it um so unless because every

767
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
genetics are gonna they're all going to

768
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,838
be a little bit different so I can't

769
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,200
just say here's a top D kiss kit for

770
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:28,639
your mom's um and it's going to work for

771
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,358
all your moms because of the wide

772
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,079
variety of genetics that we have so um

773
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,878
that's a that's that was a good question

774
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,760
that was asked in our in our Q&amp;A list

775
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,559
and that's sort of how I would address

776
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,119
it um do someone else want to add

777
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:45,559
anything or com on that yes can can I

778
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,838
add something oops sorry okay go on you

779
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:50,918
can go hey you you you guys should check

780
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:52,599
out a Grassroots superfood Veg it's it's

781
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:54,719
fish hydraulis State it's a powder it's

782
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,879
a fish hydraulis State base it's got

783
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,559
camag bunch of other nutrients in there

784
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:02,440
and that is exactly what I use to feed

785
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:06,159
my mom's I've got them in um 15 gallon

786
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,159
uh fabric um Grassroots pots and uh

787
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:09,279
they're

788
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,598
probably uh they got to be about three

789
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,240
foot by three foot by four foot tall and

790
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,280
uh I have zero issues I feed them once a

791
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:20,399
week um with their with their superfood

792
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,960
and then I hit them once uh once a week

793
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,039
with um what is it Pacific uh Grove fish

794
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,800
hydraulis State and uh yeah Z gr

795
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,358
nutrient

796
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,880
deficiencies

797
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:38,519
and I mean faster growth than I've seen

798
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,680
in um in h and faster growth than seeing

799
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,480
in a soil situation with um bottled

800
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,480
nutrients just my

801
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,159
input no how long are you running player

802
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,719
what's that how long are you keeping

803
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,399
those moms alive so and I kind of wanted

804
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,279
to try him in a couple minutes ago too

805
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,358
because generally what I do is when I

806
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,000
find a pheno that I like um it is my fir

807
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,400
my my F1 my first generation mom I

808
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,159
probably keep it around for like six or

809
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,160
seven months and then I take a cutting

810
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,118
off of it and I Mark the Tad Second

811
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,598
Generation and then I'm able to keep

812
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,280
that around for last like SE some of

813
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:17,039
them upwards of a year um but I kind of

814
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,920
see around like eight nine 11 12 months

815
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,358
they kind of start to get finicky and I

816
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,880
think that's that whole fertility thing

817
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,078
um that you're talking about not to

818
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,880
mention trying to up poot from a 15 or

819
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:32,119
20-gallon pot into like a 30 40 it's

820
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:35,559
just it's not feasible yeah for me when

821
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,720
I when Dwayne put the question forward

822
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,199
because I work at kiss and because I use

823
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:44,838
kiss soil I know and because I regularly

824
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:48,358
rotate my mom at least every three

825
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:51,279
months I know that I can keep a a nice

826
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,440
vigorous healthy plant that was vegged

827
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,359
in a one gallon I can throw that into a

828
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:01,400
10 or a 12 gallon smart pot and and I

829
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:04,639
can run that and kiss biochar water only

830
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,480
CGM for 3 months and I'm not going to

831
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,799
see any deficiencies that plan will be

832
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,280
fine uh as far as the nutrient side of

833
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,599
things calcium and phosphorus are the

834
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,800
two that I try to make sure on point for

835
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,880
my moms just as far as having the best

836
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,640
propagation results you know so those

837
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,400
those are the two elements that show up

838
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,239
as being an issue if somebody is just

839
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,079
you know if you're if you're not if your

840
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,078
clones are not rooting first thing you

841
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,400
want to do is get a scope out and look

842
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,039
at your moms and make sure you don't

843
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,318
have russets or something horrible like

844
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,639
that going on um that that's definitely

845
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:40,400
you know something that can happen

846
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,679
you'll see propagation numbers drop off

847
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,480
with russets but you'll also see it drop

848
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,239
off with calcium you'll see it drop off

849
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,920
with

850
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:50,639
phosphorus um and then when the the

851
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,400
environment of the of the propagation is

852
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,519
not ideal you've got super low uh

853
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,240
relative humidity or something like that

854
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:01,039
but for me because I'm doing regular

855
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:04,679
rotating my mom's I I like a 10 or 12

856
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,679
gallon smart pot I

857
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:12,079
like like at least

858
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:15,118
450 for my ppfd I'll go as high as 600

859
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,920
um for my moms I feel like that's that's

860
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,960
adequate and um you know it just I just

861
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,480
try to make sure I have enough to cover

862
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,720
my needs I try to make sure I've got

863
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,880
cuts that I don't need need sitting

864
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:32,118
around um and I try to make sure I've

865
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,240
got Cuts before I need them I I would

866
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,920
always rather have a plant that's a

867
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,439
little bit bigger that I can trim back

868
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,159
yeah that nice big root mass because

869
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,760
when you've got a small shoots and a

870
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:45,838
giant root mass and you throw it into a

871
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,040
bed it goes crazy um I just did the

872
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:51,119
opposite big shoots almost no roots and

873
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,400
you know lost power for two days so it

874
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,358
got cold and so everything's just moving

875
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,400
a little slowly this

876
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:02,159
time but as far far as you know metrics

877
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,280
that's that's you know what I'm shooting

878
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,239
for for a

879
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,560
mom yeah for for us at the facility it's

880
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,519
um we really don't like to let them go

881
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:16,358
more than really three months maybe

882
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:19,039
four the big imp reason for that is um

883
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:21,159
obviously we've got a whole area ready

884
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,639
to go for clone so why not use it for

885
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,000
just moms as

886
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,400
well um and the thing to think about too

887
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,639
guys is plants are a lot like us in some

888
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,760
respects like the hormones change over

889
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:34,639
the years guys it sucks but it happens

890
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,200
um when they're young and ready to grow

891
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,318
they're going to be moving stuff all

892
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:40,519
over their body so taking cuting from

893
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:43,079
anywhere is going to give you a really

894
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:46,880
good shot at getting some really

895
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,079
vigorously ready to go babies um once

896
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,440
those moms get Woody and older it takes

897
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,480
it's a lot harder it's Fighting Gravity

898
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,599
more um those things get woodier it's

899
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,679
hard those and just the the the the

900
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,079
hormones change right the plant changes

901
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:03,279
all that stuff changes so it's a lot

902
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,119
harder to clone off of an older plant

903
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,680
even if it's the healthiest prettiest

904
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,599
happiest looking thing in the world just

905
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:12,039
because the starting materials that you

906
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,240
want in a clone aren't going to be there

907
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:19,199
in abundance as you know using from a

908
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:21,959
younger mom so um it that it helps to

909
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,318
keep them young for sure as far as your

910
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,760
success

911
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:28,639
rate yeah and I think it's it's also

912
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,480
good to um take into consideration that

913
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,598
we we are growing in

914
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,119
annual so even in the best of conditions

915
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,440
let's say Southern California you start

916
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,599
your seeds in February they're flowering

917
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,760
in August so that's six months and even

918
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,680
by then I I think that's a bit of a long

919
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,720
you know most people are looking at May

920
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,358
to August which is three months um and

921
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:53,039
that plant's just ready to flower like

922
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,119
it doesn't want to keep growing it wants

923
00:40:53,039 --> 00:41:00,079
to flower um so I've found that

924
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,800
I take biocharge soil and I'll either

925
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,318
add a couple cups of Bloom booster or

926
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,880
I'll just specifically add fishbone and

927
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:11,519
gypsum and then um I keep my mom's in

928
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,838
one gallons it's definitely the bigger

929
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,679
the pot the longer you can keep it happy

930
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:20,559
but in one gallons every two months um I

931
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:23,279
take the most atypical branch and I take

932
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,799
it down about 8 in and then I use that

933
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,240
to reset um I found that they don't

934
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,960
skape a beat as long as you use

935
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,679
enough plant material and it has

936
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,440
dominance because there's going to be a

937
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:40,279
higher concentration of oxin and you're

938
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,039
kind of taking this the brain center of

939
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,640
the plant at that point um and then when

940
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,639
that goes into the soil and that Roots

941
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:50,639
the amount of growth you're going to see

942
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:53,440
come off of that clone after it's rooted

943
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,519
is way more growth than you would see

944
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,800
from trying to keep a mom for six seven

945
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,280
months but it is more work to

946
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,640
continually reset and if your watering

947
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,920
not on point those one gallon pots can

948
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:09,039
can really kill you so I would say beds

949
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,680
are the best but who's got beds

950
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,800
available for each mom you know what I'm

951
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,919
saying now you made me feel better I'm

952
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,240
in like two gallon pots resetting like

953
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,880
every two to three months basically just

954
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:24,919
trying to get two runs out of them so

955
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,039
I'm glad I'm not the only one I I i'

956
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,639
I've done it with Jack and Solo cups you

957
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:34,358
know like I was just doing

958
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:38,318
hydroponically you know so I mean Hing

959
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:43,039
on how you feed it there's really no

960
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:45,719
limit um we had a question on IG um from

961
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:48,639
ecothrift um saying I'm noticing a

962
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:51,919
turned away from the standard 18inch

963
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:55,000
Grassroots make uh towards shallow 12 in

964
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,440
and 10 in and I've also seen few

965
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,119
facilities used taller 24in Beds which

966
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,440
seems excessive so the question he's

967
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,358
asking is um when planning to use beds

968
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,039
what consideration should be taken into

969
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:12,480
account for the bed

970
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:14,558
depth 10 to 12 inches it's just for me

971
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,719
the analogy I always use is if you've

972
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:21,359
got a a tall beer glass and then a short

973
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:23,399
wide Scotch glass and you have them full

974
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,598
of sand and you pour water into them and

975
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,200
come back in a half an hour that tall

976
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,960
beer St it's going to be pretty wet at

977
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,960
the bottom and pretty dry the other 2/3

978
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,159
that Scotch glass because it's short and

979
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,159
wide is going to be much more uniform in

980
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,879
the moisture and so it just makes your

981
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,879
moisture management that much easier

982
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,000
we're also dealing with really rich

983
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,760
organic soil which holds a lot of water

984
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,838
and has a lot of weight to it um adding

985
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,119
another 12 Ines another 6 in adds you

986
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:57,920
know a lot of weight and a lot of water

987
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:00,160
weight and so um yeah for me I like a

988
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,200
shallower bed I was gonna chime in we

989
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:06,598
haven't uh we haven't determined what

990
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:08,480
the minimum depth is for growing in beds

991
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,838
and constantly testing and recycling the

992
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,880
soil so but what we have found is

993
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:17,000
facilities like gold leaf where Ben

994
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:19,680
works as well as a research scientist um

995
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,239
10 inches has been sufficient and we

996
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,159
there's multiple places we work with

997
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,598
that have gone with 10 in and that's

998
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:26,598
just a nice one because if you have a

999
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,599
12in bed you have a nice little twoin

1000
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:33,440
lip um to keep things from spilling out

1001
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,880
and uh I I don't see any advantage

1002
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,679
really to going a lot deeper than

1003
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,200
that you know we we haven't done a side

1004
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:43,440
by side uh here here at my place I'm a

1005
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:44,799
little bit deeper than that but only

1006
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,159
because I had an excessive amount of

1007
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,039
soil and I just wanted to fill the bed

1008
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,759
up more because the beds were so deep

1009
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:52,599
from Grassroots but I don't think I

1010
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,400
needed that much

1011
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,480
soil yeah does anyone want to add

1012
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:01,000
anything to that just you can oh go

1013
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:05,480
ahead BR say if you want to buy more

1014
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
soil from Kiss we're happy to do

1015
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,400
that but a lot of I end up talking

1016
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,519
people they're like okay well I've got

1017
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,838
18 or 24 inches and we end up talking

1018
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:16,440
them out of buying a bunch of soil just

1019
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:18,920
because it's going to make their life a

1020
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,440
lot easier as the grower you

1021
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,000
know oh also I'll mention the math works

1022
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,880
out really well so a 4x4 works out

1023
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
perfectly for a half a yard of soil

1024
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,800
so yeah like Brandon said we've had

1025
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,239
people call up and say I need 100 yards

1026
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,480
of soil and then we redo the map and

1027
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,639
we're like you only need 60 you know and

1028
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,800
that's yeah thousands of dollars in

1029
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:43,358
Savings in freid and and and cost on

1030
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:45,960
soil um on that note that's also why I

1031
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,199
personally prefer the shorter blue matte

1032
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,480
carrots because I know that was a

1033
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:51,199
question someone was asking me about too

1034
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,639
I don't like the really deep carrots

1035
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:56,799
because I want to know my soil moisture

1036
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:59,239
uh closer to the surface for the most

1037
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,480
part um unless I have a really really

1038
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:04,000
deep bed but even then I haven't seen

1039
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,119
any data to support needing a deeper

1040
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,159
carrot um so I almost exclusively use

1041
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,599
the short carrots with cannabis if we're

1042
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:11,879
talking about like a fruit tree or

1043
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:13,960
something then that's a different

1044
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,960
conversation but soil is going to dry

1045
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,000
out from the top first I want to keep

1046
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,000
that point moist so um that's sort of

1047
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,199
where I want to be sensing soil tension

1048
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,318
um Ben do you want to touch on that at

1049
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:28,279
all yeah for sure

1050
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,960
um the thing too to think about again

1051
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,440
from a facility and production

1052
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,760
standpoint is depending on the size of

1053
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,159
bed you're growing in you're going to

1054
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,079
likely be bringing in six to nine maybe

1055
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:41,679
12 gallons of soil every transplant

1056
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:43,000
round because you're going to be adding

1057
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,759
those one gallons if that's what you're

1058
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,318
growing in so if you do start your beds

1059
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,920
with less than the lip then you're going

1060
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,199
to actually get quite a few rounds

1061
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,318
before you have to deal with taking soil

1062
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:57,078
out of the bed because you've you know

1063
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,199
continually added more um as you go

1064
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:01,800
through the rounds same thing for soil

1065
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,358
moisture um you guys can think of water

1066
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,400
as kind of like a a pyramid so when it

1067
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:11,159
drops onto the surface it kind of does

1068
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:14,280
this kind of thing so um at some point

1069
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:16,920
if you have too much you know volume in

1070
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,280
your beds because of how you know the

1071
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,240
the cycle of the plants in you know 70

1072
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,920
some odd days um you're just not going

1073
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:28,759
to be accessing that bottom Horizon of

1074
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,119
your soil it's just going to sit there

1075
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,319
maybe go anerobic if you're not careful

1076
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,519
so it it you know you're you're

1077
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:38,639
basically making things easier on

1078
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,880
yourself um for a few different reasons

1079
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:45,000
by not just going like yeah I'm G to

1080
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,480
have an 18inch 16inch bed um we at Gold

1081
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,039
Leaf the the max will do is 12 inches

1082
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:54,440
and that's after probably a half a dozen

1083
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,838
maybe eight or so rounds of just adding

1084
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,639
nine gallons every ch transplant to each

1085
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:00,078
bed and then eventually we'll take it

1086
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,078
out what we do with that we'll actually

1087
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,519
let it rest we'll put it back in a a

1088
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,599
tote and take it outside and let it sit

1089
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:09,280
for a year and then after that we'll

1090
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,599
actually reuse it and turn that back

1091
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,400
into

1092
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:17,000
a you know veg mix that we'll reuse to

1093
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,920
shuffle in with some new stuff and um

1094
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,119
just kind of keep it sustainable as

1095
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,079
possible were you doing the bottomless

1096
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,760
plots or planting directly in your beds

1097
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,359
it's a really good question Tad and I

1098
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,319
talked about this a couple hours ago we

1099
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,759
just go straight into beds um it's a

1100
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:36,159
trial that we're going to try to get

1101
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,400
going on here pretty soon um I know that

1102
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:42,078
uh Green Life Productions does great

1103
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,680
with that um methodology of just

1104
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,318
plopping those things right on the bed

1105
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:50,798
um my questions that we want to

1106
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:53,400
investigate are one like how much uh

1107
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:56,559
height do you lose if any you know

1108
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:59,280
you're sitting on top of a bed now um

1109
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,480
and secondly I really want to get at and

1110
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,000
I haven't figured out how we're going to

1111
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,318
do this yet but I would really love to

1112
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,239
figure out the lag time

1113
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:10,519
between you know when you put that pot

1114
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:13,239
on top of your soil surface versus

1115
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:18,440
getting that rizosphere already down

1116
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:19,798
into a network of roots and microing and

1117
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,358
all sorts of stuff that were there from

1118
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:24,280
the previous round and how fast can

1119
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:26,679
those handshakes happen and does that

1120
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,200
show up in your results

1121
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:31,199
um whether that's yield or quality you

1122
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:34,199
know cannaboid all that kind of fun

1123
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:36,598
stuff but that's my kind

1124
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:38,598
of that's my thinking as far as the

1125
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,798
reason why I'm not out here just you

1126
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:43,079
know slinging them because I I really

1127
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:44,838
don't know yet if you're the time it

1128
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:46,798
takes for those roots to be like oh yeah

1129
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:49,119
this looks cool and get down into there

1130
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:51,480
versus just them already showing up

1131
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,000
there yeah I mean anecdotally I would

1132
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,079
say from my experience there's a little

1133
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,199
bit of a difference but also I kind of

1134
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,480
like the idea of removing the root mass

1135
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,919
every time too because I'm scared of

1136
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,119
hlvd and stuff that's right yeah and we

1137
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,960
do that when we go straight into the

1138
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,760
store we'll pull the main root ball up

1139
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,559
we'll shake off most of that dirt though

1140
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,359
because that's the gold that's that you

1141
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:14,839
know handshake between micro risal and

1142
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,400
all those inoculant that we want to try

1143
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:19,639
to keep in there and then recharge them

1144
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,680
with some amendments and plants are in

1145
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:26,358
the next day Justin has large beds moo

1146
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:28,118
Farms he does not

1147
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:30,279
uh so he always he ends up with an

1148
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:31,880
excess amount of soil as well so he's

1149
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,960
probably at this point got 20 or 30

1150
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,160
yards of soil that he's moved out of the

1151
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,720
facility and

1152
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,239
he's he's afraid of bringing that back

1153
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,959
in because if he did have like let's say

1154
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,959
you had some rude AIDS or something like

1155
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,760
that um you're potentially bringing it

1156
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,000
back into your vegro so that's one risk

1157
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,000
or if you know it's going outside you

1158
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,838
could be bringing in rips or you know

1159
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,599
other exterior pest potentially back

1160
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,159
into your room so he made a decision to

1161
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,920
always use fresh soil to start his veg

1162
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,798
because um you know your veg is has to

1163
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,920
be your your mother's and then your veg

1164
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:10,079
has to be the cleanest place in your

1165
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,039
facility Gold Leaf less stressed about

1166
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,039
it they move it out for a year tow it up

1167
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:16,960
it stays in the back in but um that is

1168
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:20,199
something to consider in your decision

1169
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,838
making on reusing soil once it's you

1170
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:23,399
know once your bed gets too full so I

1171
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:26,558
just wanted to touch on that sorry go

1172
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,119
ahead Louisa's got a potato farm next

1173
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,040
door and

1174
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:33,200
potatoes rud Aid they go hand inand like

1175
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,558
peanut butter and jelly and so after

1176
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:40,399
getting bit by root aphids in the

1177
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:44,040
previous grows he's decided not to risk

1178
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,960
it we could finish up about watering um

1179
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:47,880
we had a lot of questions about blue

1180
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,760
mats a lot of which you've already

1181
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,079
answered but do have a question from

1182
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:57,079
Nathaniel um his question is about

1183
00:51:53,079 --> 00:52:00,440
watching after transplanting um he asks

1184
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:03,640
um about how to water before and when to

1185
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:07,960
do water after he fills his plants often

1186
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:11,519
stall at transplant um and also he asked

1187
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,400
when to add blue mats R transplanting

1188
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,920
should you wait for roots to get to the

1189
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:19,079
bottom or should you add blue mats right

1190
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,680
away and always keep so saturated I can

1191
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:23,720
start with that if you like all very

1192
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,318
very good questions um and it's going to

1193
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,919
be maybe a little bit of a frustrating

1194
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,639
answer because so much of it depends on

1195
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,400
your environment and your grow room

1196
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:34,318
whatever you're doing it in because it

1197
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,960
really is a matter of how much those

1198
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,279
plants are transpiring and how fast

1199
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,240
they're going through whatever water

1200
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:44,400
you're giving them um at the

1201
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:47,838
facility our flower rooms will get hit

1202
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,639
they'll um the previous day they will

1203
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:53,358
get hit with a good a a good flesh not a

1204
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:55,719
crazy flesh but we will try to move some

1205
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,318
of those sodium that built up sodium I

1206
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:59,199
mean we're you know for what it's worth

1207
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:01,759
again at Gold Leaf I think we're coming

1208
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:05,879
up geez Tad what is it I think nine

1209
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:09,119
years of reusing the same soil um we're

1210
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,318
getting there so sodium can show up

1211
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,680
every now and then because we've been

1212
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:13,079
using the same medium over and over

1213
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,879
again so we will do a flush in which

1214
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:19,119
case those beds are Ultra wet we don't

1215
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:23,119
really have that um impact too much

1216
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:26,680
though they'll still go in the next day

1217
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,798
um they get hit with a compost te right

1218
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:33,239
after transplant regardless so those

1219
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:35,920
beds are very very wet um and based on

1220
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:38,959
our environmentals the size of the rooms

1221
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:42,358
air flow all that stuff it's actually

1222
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,679
not until 10 more days until that soil

1223
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:47,119
is back within range to where we want to

1224
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:50,719
put those blue mats back in and that's

1225
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,720
been all figured out just by um trial

1226
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,679
and error of you know using the moisture

1227
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:55,759
meters and you know testing a bunch of

1228
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:59,118
beds

1229
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,559
and figuring out the Sweet Spot of that

1230
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,039
80 to 100 maybe 140 M Bar and that's

1231
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,680
when that kind of levels out and then

1232
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:10,079
the blue mats go in

1233
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:13,519
um when to put blue mats in again that's

1234
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:16,599
going to depend heavily on how much

1235
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,559
water you're adding pre during post

1236
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,000
transplant and then you're really just

1237
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,119
going to want to keep an eye on the

1238
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,280
moisture levels in the you know whether

1239
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:28,920
you want to spot check like randomly so

1240
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,960
go to a container or a bed and just say

1241
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,480
literally throw a dart and be like I

1242
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,838
want to know what it is here and then I

1243
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,798
want to know what it is here um and then

1244
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:40,358
another really

1245
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:43,000
valuable method to doing to keeping an

1246
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:46,119
eyon moisture level is you know get like

1247
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,719
a plastic uh Chopstick and put a little

1248
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,200
piece of flagging tape on it and just

1249
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:51,719
stick it in the bed or in a container

1250
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,759
somewhere at the exact same spot and

1251
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:55,519
then that's your senting spot so every

1252
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,160
time you want to take a mo you know soil

1253
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:00,280
moisture reading if you got a meter you

1254
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,078
go right topstick put it in the exact

1255
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,680
same spot so that way you have a

1256
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,599
consistently consistent spot to get a

1257
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:10,000
sense of how fast water might be moving

1258
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:11,760
through um so there's there's there's

1259
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,480
pros and cons to both of those different

1260
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,119
methods as far as figuring out exactly

1261
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,559
what your soil moisture is and when to

1262
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:21,760
install blue mats um that's that's

1263
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:23,400
pretty much it and in that process

1264
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,599
you're going to learn a lot about your

1265
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,599
room just by experimenting and figuring

1266
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,200
out when do I put that one question

1267
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:35,318
you're going to be like holy smokes like

1268
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:36,439
I watered these beds to 20m Bar give you

1269
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:40,639
know for

1270
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:42,639
example and then I'm on day seven and

1271
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,798
we're you know at

1272
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:48,440
50 right and that really is the kind of

1273
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:50,960
like holy smokes this they don't need

1274
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,318
that much water or oh my God you know my

1275
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,519
room's super hot I'm on day four and I'm

1276
00:55:53,318 --> 00:56:00,119
at 160 like whoop oops so that's that

1277
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:02,519
kind of experimentation um that you know

1278
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:05,358
just the question of when do I put blue

1279
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:07,239
mats in and really be a very powerful

1280
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:08,880
learning experience for how your plants

1281
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:11,279
interact with their

1282
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,559
environment and I did just want to add

1283
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,079
real sometimes people U miss a step on

1284
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,319
transplanting

1285
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,960
because their plants are slightly

1286
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:24,719
overwatered or very saturated before

1287
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,480
they go into the beds so I always let my

1288
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:30,399
V plants dry down before transplanting

1289
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:33,159
into the bed um that way they're like

1290
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,039
hungry for the water and any soil

1291
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:38,318
without root mass is probably going to

1292
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:40,920
hold or retain extra water so having

1293
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:43,358
those plants be really hungry for water

1294
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,960
drives the roots down further into the

1295
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:48,119
bed faster and you're going to have a

1296
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,798
less likely time of overwatering like

1297
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:54,440
Ben said even if it's really wet

1298
00:56:51,798 --> 00:56:55,679
bed the plants will have a time to

1299
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,599
bounce back back as long as you don't

1300
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,440
continue watering if you're watering

1301
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,720
every day and the soil's

1302
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,798
wet those plants could have serious side

1303
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:10,919
effects if not slow down growth

1304
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:12,280
altogether yeah good point Andre oh I'll

1305
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,880
go real fast Brandon but basically I

1306
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,240
just want to say some best practices

1307
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,160
with transplanting um make sure to

1308
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:19,639
transplant the optimal time for that

1309
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:21,038
plant which means the roots are just

1310
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:23,679
reaching the edge of the pot they're not

1311
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:25,799
starting to wrap around or girdle I see

1312
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,038
photos all the time on social media

1313
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:29,119
where people like look at my healthy

1314
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,280
roots and it's really just root girdling

1315
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,039
because the roots have already started

1316
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:35,400
circling around and if that is the case

1317
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:37,680
because it happens um you need to really

1318
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,798
be aggressive and actually cut and break

1319
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:41,598
up those roots otherwise the plant will

1320
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:43,440
continue to struggle because where

1321
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,480
growth happens is or where nutrient

1322
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,400
exchange happens is at the root tip so

1323
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,280
if that root tip is circling back into

1324
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,680
the plant it's not able to access all

1325
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,480
the soil and from coming from Nursery

1326
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,639
background you know when you buy a

1327
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,159
nursery plant a lot a lot of them are

1328
00:57:55,639 --> 00:58:00,199
already girdled and so if you just take

1329
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,199
that plant it's called a rose or an

1330
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:03,598
arbid or whatever and just plant it

1331
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:06,318
right in the ground like that you can

1332
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,680
come back six months later and that root

1333
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,400
ball will look exactly the same because

1334
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:13,038
the roots aren't able to work out into

1335
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,639
the soil um we don't have that same

1336
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,480
issue in cannabis indoors because we're

1337
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,759
using all the same media but if you do

1338
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,559
plant outdoors same sort of thing make

1339
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,599
sure to mix in some of

1340
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:26,680
your native soil with maybe some 50/50

1341
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:28,000
with compost and create a transition

1342
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:29,639
into your native soil if that's what

1343
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,559
you're going into rather than into your

1344
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:34,078
beds um also like Andrew mentioned the

1345
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,359
other thing that's really important is

1346
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,519
making sure that your plant is not too

1347
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:40,759
wet going in because you want to water a

1348
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:42,679
transplant that's just really important

1349
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,200
so that means your plants have to be

1350
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:46,199
ready to accept water I mean they don't

1351
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:48,239
need to be super dry but they should be

1352
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:50,239
ready for a watering event at the time

1353
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:53,038
of transplant so plan that and then

1354
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,919
after you water them in Thoroughly you

1355
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,319
are waiting longer because just right

1356
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,760
after transplant your plants aren't

1357
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:00,599
going to it's going to take a while for

1358
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,440
those roots to really start growing that

1359
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:04,318
plant to take off so that's going to be

1360
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,079
probably the biggest Gap that you have

1361
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:10,119
in as a from a watering perspective for

1362
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:11,559
the entire cycle of the plant um short

1363
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,440
of when you first plant your rooted

1364
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:15,480
clone the same sort of same sort of

1365
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,960
principles so Brandon go ahead I just

1366
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,240
wanted to get that stuff in there oh no

1367
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,199
just the you covered it but in the same

1368
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,959
way that we're trying to coax you know

1369
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:26,519
roots to come out of a plug we want to

1370
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,960
do the same thing when we're planting

1371
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:32,480
and so I I think Andrew and Tad covered

1372
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,199
that the thing too guys if you are going

1373
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,039
to be transplanting from one container

1374
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:42,078
pulling it out of that examine the roots

1375
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:44,920
look at it and also um keep an eye on

1376
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,119
that the soil moisture of that that pot

1377
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,920
or that container that you're going to

1378
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:51,039
be going in right because if you that's

1379
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,720
dry enough and you water your bed it

1380
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,200
might not be getting anything right that

1381
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:58,239
soil that in the the the first container

1382
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,719
might be hydrophobic to the point where

1383
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,759
everything else and you're planted and

1384
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:03,759
everything right so it looks good but

1385
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,119
that Cube might just have shed water

1386
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,599
already and you wouldn't know it

1387
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,358
so you want to make sure that you're at

1388
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:13,838
the appropriate moisture level in your

1389
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:15,598
veg pots before you go into your beds

1390
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,078
otherwise you're going to think you're

1391
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,280
doing fine and that might be another

1392
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:21,798
reason for slowdown too if if people are

1393
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,359
you know thinking that well I want my

1394
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:25,000
plants to be thirsty and they dry them

1395
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:26,880
out a little too much and then you're W

1396
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,960
you're watering but that stuff's not

1397
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,000
even really registering to the

1398
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,480
plant so Brandon posted this in the chat

1399
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,318
and because I know people aren't going

1400
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,639
to be able to see the chat uh when they

1401
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,199
watch if they come back and watch the

1402
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:42,078
recording I just want to get that into

1403
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:44,318
the into the recording which is that uh

1404
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,440
if you want to do a light compost tea

1405
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:49,279
area compost tea or a light fish

1406
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,400
hydraulic application for that watering

1407
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,880
event that you do at transplant that can

1408
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,680
also help too just give them a little

1409
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,000
bit of available nutrition as they're

1410
01:00:54,679 --> 01:01:00,558
switching over into the new transplanted

1411
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,079
soil I think that's a great idea yeah

1412
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,480
that was just a challenge for me when I

1413
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,720
started with Organics because I wasn't

1414
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,000
used being you know having salt

1415
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,038
experience I was like what what's this

1416
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,159
stall out what's this one week two week

1417
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,520
stall out I don't have time for this

1418
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:18,239
that the air rated compost tea and fish

1419
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:21,119
Hydro just gets me right through

1420
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:23,838
that um Ben there's a question for you

1421
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,920
in the chat um what is your facility's

1422
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:29,719
protocol for bringing in soil uh

1423
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,119
bringing in soil back in from outside do

1424
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:34,798
you do any IPM are you re amending that

1425
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:37,358
soil before you store it outside uh so

1426
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,679
those Amendments have time to break down

1427
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,838
are you watering in any microbes to

1428
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:44,239
facilitate the breakdown yeah it's a

1429
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:45,798
really good question um we do a couple

1430
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:47,719
of things first is when we put it

1431
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:49,318
outside we do tie the tote up so it's

1432
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:52,598
not just got all sorts of nonsense

1433
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:54,838
falling into it um we let it a solid

1434
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:57,760
Year and that thing will freeze and then

1435
01:01:54,838 --> 01:02:00,599
get really hot and that whole cycle

1436
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,680
happens when we do come bring it back in

1437
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,119
uh we do make our own lactobacillus so

1438
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:07,679
we'll put some of that through there and

1439
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:11,838
then um it will get recharged with some

1440
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:15,278
amendments um and then the other thing

1441
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:18,400
that's helping us is it's not like it's

1442
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:21,000
going from a a rested state to an empty

1443
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,599
bed it's also going to be going back in

1444
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,119
with the native soil that's still being

1445
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:28,240
used in the facility so there's going to

1446
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:30,838
be a lot of already happy microbes and

1447
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:32,759
good things that's already there you

1448
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:34,759
know to compete any with anything that

1449
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,839
might be bad that's coming in but that's

1450
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,760
the other thing to think about with

1451
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:41,920
Organics is you know a lot of these big

1452
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:45,480
bad microbes that we talk about they all

1453
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,358
have competition in our system so yeah

1454
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,199
they they're probably in there but

1455
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,759
they're at such a low population number

1456
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,038
relative to the other things just

1457
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,680
because they're all competing for the

1458
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:58,278
same resources um we don't really ever

1459
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,719
see any flare ups of anything too gnarly

1460
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:03,278
but um yeah super good question so we do

1461
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:05,358
do a lab uh we recharge with microbes

1462
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:08,519
the compost teas that we add so we try

1463
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:11,278
to bring out those the populations of

1464
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:13,798
the really good stuff and you're I mean

1465
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:15,159
I think it's a Fool's errand to try to

1466
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:17,159
make sure that you're not going to have

1467
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:18,078
any bad guys in there because we're

1468
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:20,558
talking

1469
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:23,278
about you know trying to do this

1470
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:25,920
organically um but you know as long as

1471
01:03:23,278 --> 01:03:28,880
you're giving helpful Warriors enough

1472
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,798
food rest and whatever um they should be

1473
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,358
able to outcompete anything um that's

1474
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:34,278
you know going to G to end up biting you

1475
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:37,480
in the

1476
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:40,480
butt I think regular applications of

1477
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,400
either trichoderma or lab or rotating

1478
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,199
them is something every facility like

1479
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,079
you could get away with not doing it at

1480
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:49,838
home because if you lose a 4x4 it's not

1481
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,240
the end of the world but a

1482
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,639
facility there's it would be part of my

1483
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:57,439
protocol that I was doing one of those

1484
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:59,519
every week just it's it's going to out

1485
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,599
compete and there's some you know like

1486
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:03,880
one of the things that uh lactobacillus

1487
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:07,119
one of its exit dates one of the things

1488
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:10,720
that poops out is oxay oxas helps Drive

1489
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:14,000
tpping uh and triome production so

1490
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:17,159
winwin but definitely do be doing

1491
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,159
something to keep your soil microbes the

1492
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:21,798
good guys able to out compete the bad

1493
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:24,000
guys we've all got everybody in this

1494
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:24,759
chat's got fusarium and betrus on their

1495
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,760
face

1496
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:30,960
right now you cannot exclude it just out

1497
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:34,559
compete it we have a question from Keith

1498
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:37,278
um how do you use the pce test to help

1499
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,760
you create a soil prescription how does

1500
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:42,719
knowing what is in the soil solution

1501
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,000
help you know what to put in the

1502
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:49,639
soil this one's from you for you Brandon

1503
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,559
um so I'm looking at the pace test I'm

1504
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:56,480
I'm using both I I use the mic 3 the

1505
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:59,278
soil report as kind of my my savings

1506
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,838
account and then the paste reports

1507
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:03,039
what's available now that's what's in

1508
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:05,480
your pocket or in your wallet purse

1509
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:09,760
whatever and

1510
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,519
um the paste I I'm mostly looking for

1511
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:16,278
Bad actors

1512
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:19,960
chlorides um I'm looking at

1513
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:23,480
um sulfur on the paste as opposed to I

1514
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:25,720
don't look at sulfur on the mik 3 I just

1515
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:28,480
want to see what's available uh sulfur

1516
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:29,959
something that like phosphorus I'm also

1517
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,679
looking at the available

1518
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,838
phosphorus um they're they both can sit

1519
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,879
in the s for a long time before they're

1520
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:38,880
liberated so I really want to see what

1521
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,000
that available level for both of those

1522
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,079
are uh I really want to see that

1523
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,559
available phosphorus so I can compare it

1524
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,720
back to the reserve to see how

1525
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:50,359
efficiently you're cycling if you've got

1526
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:53,000
a really nice Reserve but you've got

1527
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:54,719
really poor cycling and or or low

1528
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,199
available phosphorus

1529
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,598
then we're going to look into why it's

1530
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,679
not you know is the temperature is there

1531
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:06,359
just not enough biology is it not the

1532
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:10,480
right biology um you know microbial Mass

1533
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:13,038
Mammoth p tribus uh I think somebody did

1534
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,119
ask about different uh phosphorous

1535
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,039
solubilizing bacteria and those are

1536
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,838
three good ones uh I've seen really good

1537
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:22,240
stuff already from the microbial Mass

1538
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:24,199
the folks that are using it uh microbial

1539
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:30,118
mass is also supposed to liberate

1540
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:32,879
calcium so another win-win um but I I

1541
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,838
want to see those numbers um I want to

1542
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:38,838
see if you you know like I saw a bunch

1543
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:44,239
of tests today with really poor Reserve

1544
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:47,000
but better than normal um available that

1545
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:49,598
tells me that the grower is feeding some

1546
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
sort of their phing with phosphoric acid

1547
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,278
they're feeding with fish hydrate but

1548
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,239
they're doing some sort of suppl Al

1549
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:59,480
feeding and so that just tells me

1550
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:01,118
something about the grow so I can kind

1551
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,199
of understand what that grower is doing

1552
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:07,160
a little bit because I personally am

1553
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:09,598
trying to set my grow up for a onetime

1554
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:11,278
pre-plant uh Amendment application and

1555
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:14,039
that's it then you know I'll do my

1556
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:17,400
little potassium thing at the end of

1557
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:20,960
week three but you know that that's how

1558
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,838
I'd like to do my fer fertilizer routine

1559
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,519
so I don't have to worry about it I can

1560
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:28,199
just kind of forget about about it um I

1561
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:31,639
also you know and

1562
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:36,919
then the the real money on the the pace

1563
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:41,038
report is the cat ions and um one I'm

1564
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:43,358
looking for the the actual balance of

1565
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,200
what your plant is seeing I'm looking

1566
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:48,000
for the you know to try to hit my target

1567
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:50,719
metrics but to make sure you're in

1568
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,159
Balance um it's going to give me some

1569
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:53,679
information if you're seeing something

1570
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:56,199
weird on your plant that's where I'm

1571
01:07:53,679 --> 01:08:00,838
going to look at it and I do look at the

1572
01:07:56,199 --> 01:08:02,038
the mik 3 for the Caton numbers but I

1573
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:05,519
you

1574
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:09,079
know we can go back to book club and you

1575
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:11,519
know doing doing Steve Solomon's

1576
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:13,400
approach which is you know I would agree

1577
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:14,920
that that's the right approach for

1578
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,399
outdoor

1579
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,759
grow um we're going to balance off of

1580
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:21,920
that we're going to look at sulfur

1581
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:24,679
phosphorus everything on that but with a

1582
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:28,640
potting substrate where

1583
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:31,640
the total exchange capacity is just not

1584
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,400
accurate we we can't balance that way

1585
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,159
and so we need to see what's available

1586
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:37,759
to the plant and the pace report gives

1587
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:40,559
us uh a way to do that and a way to make

1588
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:44,158
sure that there's sufficient nutrient

1589
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:46,798
and balance so um we had a couple of

1590
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:49,198
questions about phosphorus cycling uh I

1591
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:50,838
think you've covered some of it Brandon

1592
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,399
um and we have talked about it in the

1593
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:58,759
book club the recordings are all

1594
01:08:53,399 --> 01:09:01,399
available B in patreon um Pete asks um

1595
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:02,759
what are phosphorus sources and bacteria

1596
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:06,358
that cycle

1597
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:08,880
phosphorus um and Greg also um he's

1598
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:12,239
noticed through rounds of amending that

1599
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,440
his beds uh in his beds that phosphorus

1600
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,798
never seems to cycle at a rate we'd want

1601
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:19,919
to see it at um and he ask if there's an

1602
01:09:17,798 --> 01:09:22,519
any option to do something like verac

1603
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,279
composting with bone meal to really

1604
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,279
Target casting

1605
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:30,400
that would be high in phosphorus while

1606
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:32,719
trying to minimize heavy metal

1607
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,639
inputs jump in that and then I think Tad

1608
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:40,560
was just talking to Bryant about some of

1609
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:42,359
that um the as far as the the specific

1610
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,480
biology I think we already touched on

1611
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:49,480
that uh stuff like uh microbial Mass

1612
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:51,959
Mammoth P those are bi that's bacteria

1613
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:54,599
that specifically targets phosphorus

1614
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,079
solub uh solubilizing

1615
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,840
um so that would be what I would use for

1616
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:01,960
that phosphorus

1617
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:04,679
sources um you know we talked about this

1618
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,800
in book club but you know in the pursuit

1619
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:08,800
of you know and it was my challenge

1620
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,000
thing is heavy metals so in the pursuit

1621
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,480
of managing heavy metals we've really

1622
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,238
reduced our Rock inputs our soft rock

1623
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:18,399
phosphate it's still a really good input

1624
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:20,919
I don't like to do guos just because

1625
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:23,319
it's not sustainable um there's a bunch

1626
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:25,319
of environmental impacts and potential

1627
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:29,399
um

1628
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:31,679
uh bacterial um infections that can be

1629
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:35,960
passed along that way I just it's just

1630
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,440
not it's not the path forward um uh

1631
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:41,359
fishbone or

1632
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:43,639
Bine um those are those are really good

1633
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:46,399
sources um they're going to bring in

1634
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:48,840
nitrates as well um so you just need to

1635
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,759
make sure that you're balancing you know

1636
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,279
that you're managing your nitrates so

1637
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,119
that you're low enough at the end of the

1638
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:57,639
round that you can use bone meal or

1639
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:58,960
fishbone meal to bring in phosphorus

1640
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,440
that way you don't have to lean on

1641
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:03,079
softrock my favorites cow fos just based

1642
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,919
off the California registry it has the

1643
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:08,359
best heavy metal numbers so that's the

1644
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:10,279
one I would use there and then as far as

1645
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:15,559
compost and vermac

1646
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:16,960
compost um that does seem to be a you

1647
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,679
know obviously that's going to be very

1648
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,560
labor intensive and would depend on if

1649
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,640
you

1650
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:25,440
know you know Greg is somebody that's

1651
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,320
you know obviously capable and would be

1652
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:31,119
willing to to do the labor to do

1653
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:32,880
something like that uh you know homow

1654
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:36,079
you just might not have the space to do

1655
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:38,079
that um you know and so it might just be

1656
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:40,519
better to really super load up your

1657
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:42,279
reserves you know go way over your

1658
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,920
Target and then just do weekly

1659
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:51,039
applications of microbial mass or

1660
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:54,279
Mammoth P um but uh I have read stuff uh

1661
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,079
I've not personally done it but um

1662
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:59,359
we talked about that book club as well I

1663
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:03,399
think uh last week or the the one before

1664
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:05,880
where uh Steve was suggesting putting uh

1665
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:08,879
phosphorous sources into compost or

1666
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:11,039
vermac compost so that it would be you

1667
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,520
know we're talking about particle size

1668
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,399
and the more something's broken down the

1669
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,320
more readily available it will be and

1670
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:21,638
that sort of stuff and so it would um it

1671
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:23,119
would follow that adding phosphorous

1672
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:24,039
source to compost would make it more

1673
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,760
available

1674
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:29,079
and so that would be a a good longterm

1675
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:32,159
project uh it wouldn't be a quick fix a

1676
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:35,079
quick fix would be something like uh uh

1677
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:39,519
Pacific grow seos just a liquid low

1678
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:41,840
nitrogen um cheat and uh pH and with

1679
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:45,239
phosphoric acid is a great way to have

1680
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:48,400
available uh P so I think I answered all

1681
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:51,238
that um yeah that's great thank you um

1682
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:54,198
so we're trying to wrap up does anyone

1683
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:57,799
have any final questions

1684
01:12:54,198 --> 01:12:59,839
I do did we get even close questions

1685
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:04,480
yeah we're about we've covered about

1686
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:07,079
maybe 50 60% of questions um that came

1687
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:10,678
up so I mean we by all means we can do

1688
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:14,920
this again or we can try and cover some

1689
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:17,239
of the questions either on IG or on on

1690
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:20,279
patreon um I mean we have a lot of Food

1691
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:22,359
For Thoughts so one one note to add just

1692
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:24,960
because um well two notes so the first

1693
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:27,119
thing on the Foster thing um from a

1694
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,439
plant perspective if if your plant needs

1695
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:31,960
available

1696
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:35,079
phosphorus phosphoric acid is the best

1697
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,560
option even though it's not organic just

1698
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:40,719
in terms of the plant the plant doesn't

1699
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:45,120
care if your nitrate comes from calcium

1700
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:48,198
nitrate not organic or um you know fish

1701
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,519
meal for example um so like I just want

1702
01:13:48,198 --> 01:13:50,879
to mention that so when people are

1703
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,400
thinking about options now fish

1704
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,880
hydrolysate is stabilized with

1705
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,599
phosphoric acid that's sort of the cheat

1706
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,639
on the in terms of the national organic

1707
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:02,120
program of what they allow because it it

1708
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:05,400
stabilizes the the fish

1709
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:06,800
so that some people are GNA be like nope

1710
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:09,399
I'm not going to touch that because it's

1711
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,520
not truly organic and I totally respect

1712
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:14,559
that I think that's fine um but for

1713
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:17,480
people that are less concerned about

1714
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:20,719
that sort of organic you know synthetic

1715
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:22,319
conventional argument um phosphoric acid

1716
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,000
is the is the easiest way to get your P

1717
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:26,039
levels up

1718
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,399
and Banos is too is another one but

1719
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:29,039
there's a lot of reasons not to use

1720
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:30,638
those but I see when people add Banos

1721
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,439
into their soil their available p is

1722
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:34,560
quite High um and then just the other

1723
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:36,759
thing I want to mention to you guys

1724
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,840
totally unrelated to Q&amp;A but we just set

1725
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,600
up the Discord so you should be able to

1726
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,600
like share your own grow on there and

1727
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,199
people can comment on it U so people can

1728
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,719
have their own uh you know posts or

1729
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:51,599
channels and then um we can all chat on

1730
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:53,679
there better than patreon because I'm

1731
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,679
gonna something that we want to add I'm

1732
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,520
going to send out an invite for that to

1733
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,480
everybody

1734
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,960
tomorrow sweet I'm looking forward to

1735
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:04,599
seeing everyone's uh grow on there too

1736
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:09,239
yeah did did you guys want me to touch

1737
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:12,679
real quick on a lwh heavy metal um

1738
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:15,919
compost mix that people can try

1739
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:19,480
sure yeah um so you could just use Pete

1740
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,399
Moss because um Pete Moss is usually

1741
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:25,399
very low in heavy metals and then we've

1742
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:27,198
also found that um base of pee Moss

1743
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:29,479
which is probably going to be what's in

1744
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:31,719
your growing media anyway so it'll mix

1745
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:33,359
well if you're using it to a mend um and

1746
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:35,239
then you can just add

1747
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:39,119
fishbone

1748
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:43,519
gypsum and um insect brass and all those

1749
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:46,158
have very low levels of arenic um gypsum

1750
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,840
will have a tiny bit of lead so if you

1751
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:52,519
are worried about lead um leave the

1752
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,719
gypsum out but if you add something like

1753
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,000
agline

1754
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:59,039
or other calcium sources most of those

1755
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,800
come with some arsenic so it's kind of a

1756
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:04,679
battle you got to pick most of the time

1757
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:07,039
between arsenic or lead um unfortunately

1758
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:09,719
calos has a little bit of both which is

1759
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,359
why we've been reducing it in our mixes

1760
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:15,158
and leaning on the fishbone um because

1761
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:18,559
the fishbone is just super clean and the

1762
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:23,439
insect frass um that we have right now

1763
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:27,320
is super clean so you could get a very a

1764
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:28,839
high phosphorus based casting with um a

1765
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:34,000
good reserve of

1766
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:35,480
calcium that is virtually arsenic free

1767
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,279
with a little bit of lead from the

1768
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:40,519
gypsum and then if you take out the

1769
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:42,800
gypsum there is calcium in fishbone and

1770
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:46,239
worms naturally coat their calciums in a

1771
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,639
calcium bicarbonate so there should in

1772
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:51,519
theory be enough calcium without the

1773
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:54,560
gypsum but the extra calcium in sulfate

1774
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,760
that comes with the gypsum um I I love

1775
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,719
that combination when we're talking

1776
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,560
about cannabis so personally if I was

1777
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:04,359
going to set up like an ultra clean

1778
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:07,560
vermac composting setup I would amend

1779
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:10,479
Pete Moss with insect frass fishbone and

1780
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,760
gypsum uh add my worm population once I

1781
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:14,839
made sure that that was not enough to

1782
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,480
heat up the Pete in any way so once I

1783
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:20,719
know that it's a safe environment add

1784
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:24,359
your worms and there there's really not

1785
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:29,000
going to be much of a um resting period

1786
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:29,000
needed for that for that type of a

1787
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:33,599
mix and you can hit us sub if you want

1788
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,239
to know the brands that we've tested

1789
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,719
because depending on where the gypsum's

1790
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:38,359
mined will'll have different levels of

1791
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,319
heavy metal so don't just think that all

1792
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:43,519
gypsum's the same that's throw that out

1793
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:45,599
there yeah sorry these are specifically

1794
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,840
the products that we stock are the ones

1795
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,840
that we've tested I couldn't speak to um

1796
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,440
every brand and gypsum is one of those

1797
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:56,440
things where the lower the quality the

1798
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:58,759
more heavy metals you'll see so don't uh

1799
01:17:56,439 --> 01:18:00,479
skimp on the gypsum just because you

1800
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,760
think you can get it from the paint shop

1801
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:02,759
down the

1802
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:07,359
street good tip well you can always get

1803
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:10,198
the brands that we carry but yeah sorry

saying those are good tips and uh it's

1806
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,679
