32
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,158
on to the

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,400
show so a couple of things that you've

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,400
taught me again correct me if I misspeak

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,960
uh around oils and the reason that you

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,640
like sufff oil which is mineral oil

37
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:44,599
based also montere Garden horticultural

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:47,920
oil is because uh it has uh less REI

39
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,718
requirements um it biodegrades faster

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
and it's something that you can spray

41
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:53,478
pretty easily and it has a lot of data

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,478
showing its Effectiveness uh there is a

43
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,718
new product called EP Shield um we're

44
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,438
working with them right now to try and

45
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,280
get into this smaller container size so

46
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:06,038
that it can be available to a wider

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,478
range of Growers uh and that product has

48
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,159
no

49
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,400
REI um and smells phenomenal and it's

50
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,759
Botanical based uh so and there's a lot

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,879
of data to support it but um that's one

52
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,039
of the advantages of these oils is that

53
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,439
they work as a suffocant and so the the

54
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,318
pest can't really develop a resistance

55
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,359
to them like they could something that

56
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:33,399
has a you know neural effect or or other

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,440
mod of mode of action um do you want

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,080
to correct anything there well I mean

59
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,878
you're absolutely right on you know the

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,640
the stff oil I mean one of the reasons I

61
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,479
like that too is because of particle

62
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:49,679
size it's a very small particle oil um

63
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,119
so that when you spray you just spray a

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,800
Mist you do not spray to runoff and you

65
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:00,560
have such fine thin particle layer it

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,120
can coat very tiny insects and mites um

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,799
that's why it works really well on area

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,879
fiad mites and even area fied eggs is

69
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,239
because you have just you know billions

70
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:14,639
of these tiny particles that can coat to

71
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,680
suffocate the eggs and um the the the

72
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:21,598
adults larval stages all those different

73
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,599
things um and so far we've not seen any

74
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,878
resistance to it and that's what I also

75
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,679
like I also like that once it's dry you

76
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,598
can release beneficials there's no

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,599
residue from it and ites doesn't clog

78
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,399
pores or stroma in your plants I mean we

79
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,079
you know as long as you use it according

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,438
to the label um you know you're not

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
going to have any issues with it it's

82
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,878
when people accidentally like oh my gosh

83
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,518
I applied it at you know a 4% rate and I

84
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:49,840
burned my plants or I sprayed it noon

85
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,879
you know those kinds of things um the EP

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,039
Shield is super interesting um because

87
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:58,399
it does have plant Botanicals but they

88
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:01,280
don't understand completely how

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,640
Botanicals always work as

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,840
pesticides um and so the exact mode of

91
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,039
actions are always not worked out on all

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,158
these compounds they just know they work

93
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:17,120
um and they break down quickly um

94
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:21,279
because uh they are uh derived from

95
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,759
plants and generally aren't very stable

96
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,799
ones applied

97
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,120
um uh

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
so we we again the EP Shield is

99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
interesting because we don't don't fully

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,720
understand all the mo of actions of it

101
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,918
but it's the right combinations of

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,440
different things that the the the trials

103
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,159
have been excellent with it on mites um

104
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,879
especially two spot spidermite all life

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,120
stages and it's been looking very good

106
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:53,279
on cannabis aphid 2 without having an

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,639
REI um on it that

108
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,719
said you know if you have allergy

109
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,840
problems as I do that doesn't mean you

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,120
could not have a reaction from some of

111
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:08,719
these uh compounds um I've actually in

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
recent years because I've done so much

113
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,919
work with hibiscus the years when I go

114
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,240
into hibiscus greenh houses I tend to

115
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:18,560
now have some respiratory stuff

116
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,560
happening um because long-term low dose

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,639
exposure to anything uh can trigger

118
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,240
allergens over time um so even though

119
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,199
they have a zero

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,600
REI and don't have the restrictions I

121
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,000
would still it still is a pesticide and

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,960
I still would you know treat it with

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
respect and one of the nice things about

124
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:47,000
those two products that you you touched

125
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,120
on too is uh less risk of phytotoxicity

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,319
and lower you're using much lower

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,519
concentrations of active ingredients

128
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,840
than you might with other commercially

129
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,959
available products on the market would

130
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,719
you say you're making a face at me I

131
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,399
mean I I've one of the things I've seen

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,960
when reading about let me clarify this

133
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,159
maybe active ingredient was the wrong

134
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,359
word the the concentrations that you're

135
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,759
you're able to spray from what I've seen

136
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,520
is much lower and I'm getting this from

137
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,160
reading on the bioworks website with a

138
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,639
product like epich Shield than some of

139
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,400
the other commercially available

140
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,160
products how would you phrase that

141
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,239
better than I just did so

142
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,439
um just

143
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,800
like other thing you can buy different

144
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,319
things in different

145
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,240
concentrations and generally Big Egg buy

146
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,879
stuff more concentrated and dilute it

147
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
more homeowners pesticides are generally

148
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,839
more

149
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:43,000
dilute um and so that they because when

150
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:46,000
you mix up super concentrated

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,038
things and you mess it up a little bit

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,079
it can be disastrous because those are

153
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,959
so concentrated so sometimes dealing

154
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,680
with more dilute things are easier for

155
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,318
mixing does that that make sense yeah I

156
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,038
think what I was getting at is the

157
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:07,160
concentration needed for efficacy so Epi

158
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:11,759
yes so Epi Shield the way the product is

159
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,199
made um it takes a lot less active

160
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,759
ingredient to see the results than you

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,038
would with seoil x suffoil x typically

162
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,960
you're at a 1 to

163
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:28,719
2% active ingredient per set amount of

164
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,399
water so if you have 100 gallons of

165
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,240
water you're going to add one to two

166
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:37,519
gallons of suffoil X into it and you're

167
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,120
going to see efficacy there because of

168
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:44,719
the active ingredients in Epi Shield its

169
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,720
rate is

170
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:55,038
0.1% so it's you need a lot less of it

171
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:59,638
in order to see efficacy when you mix it

172
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:02,598
up the concern I have with that

173
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,158
is when you if you're a hom grower or

174
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:09,120
doing small amounts and you're going to

175
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:12,199
mix up one gallon if you get your rate

176
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,439
just slightly off it's going to be a

177
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:20,439
huge mistake um and can then cause burn

178
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:24,598
because you you uh are putting out too

179
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:27,719
much suffoil X um again you've got more

180
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:30,719
wiggle room on mistakes there and that's

181
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,200
why um if you go by biow Works booths at

182
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,080
trade shows they're providing syringes

183
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,000
to help measure because if you're trying

184
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,479
to pour out a tablespoon or a teaspoon

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,158
you know I do this because I do a lot of

186
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,479
candy making I pour you know cinnamon

187
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:43,879
oil into a spoon and they pour it out

188
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,519
and I'm like wow how much is really

189
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,240
staying behind and it's stuck to that

190
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,320
spoon because you're getting that full

191
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,639
amount and so that's why I think the

192
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,200
syringes are a much better way to

193
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:59,519
measure um for a homeg grower anybody

194
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,640
that's you know mixing up anything under

195
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,360
10 gallons of of product because um it

196
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,360
would be very easy to make a mistake on

197
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,879
the Epi shield and burn your plans um

198
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,320
also doing the math okay cannabis

199
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,078
Growers stop contacting me asking me to

200
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,278
figure out your rates for small amounts

201
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,719
for

202
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:22,120
you you um I math is not one of my

203
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,160
strongest points bio works for their

204
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,600
products does have a rate calculator on

205
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,519
their website that you can put in the

206
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,120
product you're using and how much you

207
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:35,159
want to make and it can help calculate

208
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,799
that for you also today with you know Ai

209
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:41,278
and all that stuff they can easily um M

210
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,559
do your rates for you but with the EP

211
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,519
Shield again a little more because more

212
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,199
is better is not good in this situation

213
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:53,759
you really need to stay with that um

214
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,959
recommended labeled rate for that

215
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,759
product so in my head what I was

216
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,000
thinking of with my comment about

217
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,078
concentration

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,039
was more was less comparing suffoil and

219
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,559
EP Shield but comparing EP shield and

220
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:11,958
suffoil to other commercially available

221
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:14,559
products less with epy Shield a lower

222
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,479
concentration of final applied product

223
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,639
that you're less likely to see compared

224
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,320
to other Botanical 25b products on the

225
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,039
market that don't have as much research

226
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,879
around them you're less likely to see

227
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,480
phytotoxicity or other issues and still

228
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,600
get the efficacy that you want um at the

229
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,278
end of the day that's what I was okay

230
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,839
yeah because you're you're putting out

231
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,519
less

232
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,959
AI um active ingredient not artificial

233
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,839
intelligence but you're putting out less

234
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:42,759
active ingredient and still getting the

235
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,360
results um for a good price point CU you

236
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,799
know at the end of the day Money Matters

237
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,480
on the cost of these things and I know

238
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,039
some people when they look at the cost

239
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,000
of epy Shield they're like oh my gosh

240
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,838
it's a tiny bottle it's so expensive but

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,039
you have to realize at the rates you're

242
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:01,040
going out at are very low um and so it

243
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:04,439
it doesn't take as Much Chemistry to

244
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,719
kill because of the not completely

245
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,320
understood ways it kills compared to an

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,560
oil or even a soap that you need a

247
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,879
higher percentage to smother and

248
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,078
activate it but yeah I think I think

249
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:19,639
when it comes

250
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:23,199
to um these

251
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,720
um plant Botanical

252
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,160
based uh products I think EP Shield's

253
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,278
going to I think it's going to take over

254
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,360
the market and that's going to be the

255
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:35,078
one standing um because of all the I

256
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,519
mean it's it's been a really really good

257
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,599
product now one thing it's not as

258
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,000
effective with as I understand it is

259
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,680
with uh

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,958
thrips that are pupating inside the leaf

261
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,879
tissue like whereas

262
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:53,119
with you're making faces at me I making

263
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,879
faces at you this is good this is good

264
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,039
cuz I I am not an expert here and I'm

265
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,000
learning myself so as I understand it uh

266
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,759
thrips can

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,078
can lay eggs inside of the leaf tissue

268
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,240
of cannabis and then when they emerge

269
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,679
there is some efficacy with seoil but

270
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,919
that is you don't get that efficacy with

271
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:17,439
EPA shield now please correct me if I'm

272
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,879
wrong on that okay so epy Shield was

273
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,040
originally the market was going to be a

274
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:27,360
midde that's you know where the focus

275
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:29,799
was but as the product's been used um

276
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,159
we've seen activity on other end insects

277
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,799
and that's where it's like wait a minute

278
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:36,360
you know it's knocking back a it's

279
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:39,759
pretty good um with rips you are correct

280
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,278
most not all thrips but most thrips do

281
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:46,278
lay their eggs inside of plant tissue

282
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:49,639
Western Flower thrips onion thrips Ayo

283
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:52,399
thps um parvy spinus they lay their eggs

284
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,399
in the plant tissue now there has been

285
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,720
some new information and I feel like a

286
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,278
dumbass because I didn't know this and

287
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,680
apparently there was some research done

288
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:07,559
in Canada looking at suffoil

289
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:10,759
x and they did find and I I'm I'm

290
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:13,638
guessing this didn't get published um

291
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,679
and our our buddy Mr MB over there is

292
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,360
the one who told me about this and he's

293
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:22,359
like well how do you not know this

294
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,440
Suzanne um they found with stff oil they

295
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:30,560
were able to kill about

296
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:33,639
50% of Western Flower thp's eggs why is

297
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,679
because when insects lay their eggs

298
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,560
inside a plant tissue and if you come

299
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,799
doing my presentations you know I've got

300
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,759
videos of like oras inserting their eggs

301
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:46,240
and things like that they they leave the

302
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,278
tiniest bit of the eggs sticking out and

303
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,240
that's where the air exchange is

304
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:53,720
happening they're respirating through

305
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,240
that little tip there and if you put an

306
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,399
oil over it it suffocates the eggs just

307
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,159
the same way as if an egg is laid on a

308
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,639
plant surface and you cover it with an

309
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:09,559
oil it will suffocate it because they do

310
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:13,000
need to respirate so this is some newer

311
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,479
information that the suffoil can and

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,958
again the work was only done on Western

313
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,959
Flower thrips which you know we

314
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:23,439
generally do not find in cannabis um uh

315
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,879
but it's very interesting now I don't

316
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,959
know if they

317
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:33,198
have done any of the work looking at egg

318
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:36,198
efficacy with epy Shield my guess is

319
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:39,319
leaning towards no because I don't think

320
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:42,879
it's as much as a Suffocation mode of

321
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,959
action and it's more of a chemical um

322
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,759
you know I don't want to say it akin to

323
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,719
pyrin but something's happening with

324
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,000
those

325
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,079
Botanicals um in there and the other

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,480
ingredients but I I don't think they

327
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,799
know because they haven't looked at it

328
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,519
because for years we've always said you

329
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,000
know no pesticides kill um Western

330
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,799
Flower thrips eggs but then all of a

331
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,278
sudden Boop wait a minute no oils can

332
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:12,000
kill like 50% of the eggs but after they

333
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,720
do hatch and I think where you're going

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,480
for with the not all that's that's where

335
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,399
I was going actually because I talked to

336
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,199
Michael two weeks ago and he explained

337
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,679
this to me so that was what I was trying

338
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:26,198
to say but they don't the the pupa is

339
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,278
not in the leaf tissue okay so depending

340
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:29,639
on the thrip species some drop to the

341
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:33,559
soil to pup

342
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:38,480
others pupate on a leaf surface but they

343
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,479
don't go back into the tissue to

344
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,799
pupate okay that makes sense so I you

345
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,719
were close screwed it up but I was close

346
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,519
it was just one word but that's okay I

347
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,879
mean no that's that's good that's good I

348
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,278
and I appreciate the correction because

349
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,480
that's how I learned too um on that note

350
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,600
with thrips one of the things that

351
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,360
Brandon shared with me from from one of

352
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,759
your workshops was that or webinars was

353
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,199
that you're seeing a higher incidents or

354
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:09,800
or primarily onion thrips now in

355
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:12,159
cannabis not now I've always found onion

356
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:14,078
always onion thrips okay so some of our

357
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,399
management options should not be based

358
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:22,638
around Western Flower

359
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:25,519
thrips Behavior yes or life cycle yes um

360
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,799
I if you go out online a lot of people

361
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,839
talk about Western Flower thrips and

362
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,719
Canabis and I mean it's because they're

363
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,440
not doing their due diligence collecting

364
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,360
samples and identifying things I not

365
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,199
going to say you cannot find Western

366
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:43,159
Flower thrips and cannabis um but every

367
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:46,758
sample well let me just say this I I

368
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:50,278
have not gotten a Western Flower thrips

369
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,560
sample from a cannabis grower I found

370
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,639
other thri species um and we just had

371
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,159
you know you were mentioning before

372
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,000
about oh you've always got interesting

373
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,879
stories you know I just had a a thing

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,318
not too long ago with somebody had

375
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,519
another consultant in there the

376
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,199
consultant told him they had Western

377
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,838
Flower thps they wrote him this whole

378
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,919
thing about managing Western Flower

379
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:15,838
thrips um I went in behind this other

380
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:20,400
person in his facility and immediately

381
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,879
I'm like those are weird thrips um and

382
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,679
they were absolutely they did weren't

383
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,000
even close to being Western Flower

384
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,640
thrips cuz so Western Flower thrips and

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,960
onion thrips you almost have to micro

386
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,200
put them under a microscope and slide

387
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,960
mount them to tell them apart um because

388
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,200
you have to look at the positions of the

389
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,919
hairs on the pronotum you have to look

390
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,440
at the sil ey color those are the spots

391
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
on the top of their head you have to

392
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,400
count antennal segments and you have to

393
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,879
do all that to tell them apart I think

394
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,480
people are just doing quick looks and

395
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,240
doing quick picture matches um so I mean

396
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,839
I could understand where people would

397
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,159
get onion thrips and Western Flower

398
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:01,759
thrips confused that's easy but this

399
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,880
thrips wasn't even close um

400
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:07,440
and

401
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:11,880
uh I had to reach out for help because I

402
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,880
could only get it to genus um and it's a

403
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,880
species that hasn't even been really

404
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,039
described in the last report of it was

405
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,880
in the

406
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:24,200
1960s um

407
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,480
and so my point is on on the thrips is

408
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,360
you have to do your due diligence and

409
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,240
identify which one it is so that you can

410
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,479
put a better Management program together

411
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:40,880
um and this is true ornamentals

412
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:43,798
vegetables cannabis everybody um

413
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,280
because uh onion thrips and Western flow

414
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:49,798
thrips do have

415
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,839
different chemistries that work on them

416
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:55,558
differently because of resistance issues

417
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,079
um the biology between onion thrips and

418
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:58,599
Western Flower thrips are very similar

419
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:02,079
but once you start getting into a kind

420
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:06,199
of thrips and this other thrip species

421
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:08,240
um they're not the same biologies so um

422
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,880
you just you know you got to stop

423
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,679
guessing and you've got to stop matching

424
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,559
pictures of just people's quick pictures

425
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,519
online um because you're going to end

426
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:20,519
you're going to get yourself into

427
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,960
trouble so we're we're already getting

428
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,240
run out of time here I had a few other

429
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,360
questions for you maybe I just wanted to

430
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,519
skip to do you have any other sort of

431
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,439
stories of common misidentifications or

432
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,000
where these improper application rates

433
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,440
cuz I know you and I have talked off air

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,960
and you've talked about how like

435
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,840
sometimes people will work with a

436
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,319
consultant or a thirdparty distributor

437
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:51,199
of of beneficials like myself that

438
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,158
supplies you know we sell biob insects

439
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,080
for example and they might prescribe

440
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:59,679
rates that are wildly too high or too

441
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,639
low to get control um so people may

442
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,480
either be wasting money or they may be

443
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,360
spending money but not enough to get

444
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,640
actual control at based on the size of

445
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,000
their

446
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,000
crop I mean I think the problem with the

447
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,798
rates is if somebody calls me and

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,440
they're like hey you know I've got two

449
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,798
spot spider M and I want to control a

450
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,000
pmus what's the

451
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,119
rate it's it's there's not an easy

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,159
answer

453
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:29,839
because is a propagation where your

454
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,440
plant is an inch tall or are they 10-ft

455
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:36,798
palm trees and so rates can be all

456
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,558
across the board I know I know companies

457
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:42,200
try to put out a

458
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:44,038
basic middle of the road kind of rate

459
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,558
but you really if if you just call

460
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,079
somebody and they don't ask you more

461
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,119
about you know what you're spacing how

462
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,119
tall the crops even Leaf texture can

463
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:55,558
make a difference um we're talking about

464
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:57,079
spider mites like in tomatoes uh pmas

465
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,319
really struggle to get through those

466
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:01,678
tricomes so you really have to up your

467
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:04,079
rates of per simulus in tomatoes

468
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,759
compared to Tropical foliage because you

469
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,720
have that smooth Leaf surface where they

470
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,480
can run around it's like ice skating for

471
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,558
them so there's a lot of variables that

472
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,200
go into rates um and so that's why it's

473
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:18,119
important to talk with somebody and it

474
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,519
does not have to be me um but talk with

475
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,278
somebody that's

476
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,319
really

477
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,480
understands these systems and you know

478
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,720
takes the time to ask you questions to

479
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,839
figure out what the right rate for what

480
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,440
you're going to to need is now when it

481
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,359
comes to Hom grows homeowners you got

482
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,960
five or six plants you can afford to put

483
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,678
out insane numbers of mites because even

484
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,159
like pilus I think the smallest they

485
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,679
come in really is like

486
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,080
2,000 and that that covers a lot but you

487
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,600
know you're talking maybe 15 bucks you

488
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,839
know so a homeowner's like yeah I can

489
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,119
afford that for my commercial Growers

490
00:21:53,839 --> 00:22:00,240
when we need to treat like 50 acres you

491
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,959
we really like have to get the numbers

492
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,880
exactly right because if not it gets

493
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,840
very expensive very fast so there's all

494
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:13,400
these variables that go into making um

495
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,959
rate recommendations and that's where I

496
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,798
really you know working with a lot of

497
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,600
bug people out there um you know the

498
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:26,440
guys from biob guys from beneficial

499
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:27,959
insectary um you know um copert um

500
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,360
biobest you know of all these different

501
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,400
companies

502
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,599
most of their people have had a better

503
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:39,240
experience and that can take the time to

504
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,959
help put those better rates together

505
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,038
what we did see happening is when

506
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,880
cannabis legalization happened there

507
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,278
were some unscrupulous people that are

508
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,880
like well cannabis don't know any better

509
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:52,960
and they were selling them ridiculous

510
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,440
rates of products I mean it it was

511
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,079
insane and in charging Crazy

512
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,759
Prices like for what my girl are paying

513
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,639
14 cents for I saw Growers paying $2

514
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,720
cannabis Growers paying $2 for which I

515
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,278
just have zero tolerance for that kind

516
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,558
of you know gouging um I think that the

517
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:16,480
Cannabis scores have become more

518
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:19,319
educated on bios and even chemistries

519
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,038
and how to purchase and they're buying

520
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,599
for more traditional suppliers or

521
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:27,119
they're getting better pricing these

522
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:29,278
days um but we pesticides the label is

523
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:33,839
the law the rates are right there it's

524
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:37,519
easy to figure out bio rates are very

525
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,959
subjectives and um you really need if if

526
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,519
you're new you need to work with

527
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,679
somebody that can help guide you um on

528
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,359
the program because again there's a lot

529
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,120
of variables that go into making these

530
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,278
rate

531
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,399
decisions yeah and I just wanted to do

532
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,119
one quick Shameless plug because we do

533
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,000
work with biob and Ship Direct from

534
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:01,038
insectary and when we have situ with

535
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,359
like a facility or someone U you

536
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,400
mentioned you know you're not the only

537
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,918
one that can do this frankly you can't

538
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,559
do this for everyone um so if you can't

539
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,120
afford to have Suzanne come out uh one

540
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:15,000
of the resources that we do have is uh

541
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:19,359
Kelly Vance and Saul Alba with biob both

542
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,679
excellent um technical advisers and uh

543
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,678
friends of Suzanne and so uh it's been

544
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,559
great to be able to use them as

545
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,360
resources at least with helping our

546
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,079
company and and other companies should

547
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,079
have someone similar something similar

548
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:35,319
that would allow you to get uh better

549
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,678
dialed rates for what you're doing um in

550
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,678
your facility or even in your home grow

551
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,000
I love

552
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:45,480
Kelly yeah I mean I you guys are good

553
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,278
friends I I've known him a long time um

554
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,960
and um he's a real I mean Saul's awesome

555
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,880
too but I know Kelly much better I've

556
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,519
known him a lot longer um and I'm I'm

557
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,120
always proud to walk into a greenhouse

558
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:02,480
with Kelly next to me because he's not a

559
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:06,479
bullshitter he is you know he was a

560
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,798
grower he he knows um he's been in your

561
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,120
shoes and so he doesn't want to be taken

562
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,679
advantage of um so he doesn't take

563
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,918
advantage of people he's a he's a really

564
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,840
good

565
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,240
guy yeah so if you're listening to the

about insects or get in touch with with

568

571
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,480
connection Okay so moving on last

572
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,278
question of the day I'll let you get

573
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,519
back to your day

574
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,880
um common misidentifications that you

575
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,839
see in the Cannabis

576
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,679
industry um I know a lot of times people

577
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,959
will at least online say like what is

578
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,480
this and it turns out it's um like a

579
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,960
mold Mite that may have been introduced

580
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,720
when they introduce beneficials or

581
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,038
another one would be springtails that I

582
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,880
see things that are not necessarily of

583
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,558
um considered pest

584
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,720
within

585
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:06,119
um within within your within your garden

586
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,440
I don't know what what are your thoughts

587
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,558
um I think the Cannabis grows have

588
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,880
gotten a lot better um I I've saved on

589
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,558
my computer that in the early days of

590
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,520
legalization somebody put out this ID

591
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:21,359
manual and for their fungus naap picture

592
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:24,879
they had a winged aphid and I think that

593
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:27,479
started everybody off onto the wrong

594
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,000
footing um because people were trying to

595
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,000
be helpful but they put out a lot of

596
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,159
misidentification and there's still a

597
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,319
lot

598
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:41,360
of bad ID photos online um I've seen

599
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:44,200
pictures of pilus that are actually

600
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,839
velvet mites

601
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,798
um so I mean again I think the Growers

602
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,359
have gotten better um they they've

603
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:54,319
learned from coming to classes whether

604
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:57,119
it be my classes or you know hearing

605
00:26:54,319 --> 00:27:00,398
talks from again like Kelly or Stephen

606
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,439
authors um they've gotten better so

607
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:04,558
there's less

608
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,759
misidentification um but there is still

609
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:13,720
confusion between fungus knats and um

610
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:16,558
winged rude aphids that does come up um

611
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,120
broad mites and area fied Mite sometimes

612
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:22,398
can be a little confusing um for for

613
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,759
Growers if you don't have enough

614
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:28,359
magnification uh to look

615
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:31,440
at um I also think another thing that

616
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:33,599
periodically comes up and it's not a

617
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,558
pest issue but their concerned it is is

618
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,759
if is

619
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:40,639
um insects from outside flying in and

620
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,720
then flying up to the lights and then

621
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,320
dying and then falling back onto the

622
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,480
plants I've had that a handful of times

623
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:50,599
now where people think they're these

624
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,720
weird insects on their plants

625
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:56,519
and excuse me they're typically some

626
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,440
kind of mge um that have come from some

627
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,359
fresh water that got sucked in some

628
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,840
somewhere and they come in and die but

629
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,678
because of the tricomes they stick to

630
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,119
the

631
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,919
plants and so those can be mistaken

632
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,558
sometimes for fungus Nets but you have

633
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,440
to look at you know the venation on the

634
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,839
wings um to be able to tell these

635
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,480
different species apart but I do overall

636
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:16,759
I mean I think the Cannabis SES are

637
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,200
getting smarter um they're getting

638
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:24,919
better um they've done a really good job

639
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:28,600
of of um getting educated but just make

640
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:32,120
sure you're getting education from good

641
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,359
sources um because there there's still a

642
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,558
lot of bad information out on the

643
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,240
internet and the stuff in the internet

644
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,000
just never goes

645
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,200
away on that note of bad information one

646
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,398
last friendly reminder uh to not buy

647
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,440
ladybugs and in my opinion please don't

648
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,398
support the companies that are sending

649
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,080
them for free in with their product or

650
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,759
selling them now there are a few there

651
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:57,199
there is some commercially rear lady

652
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,398
ladybirds available now correct but it's

653
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,480
rare well it's not that they're rare

654
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:07,518
it's they're expensive because they have

655
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:11,839
to rear them um which um I'm waiting to

656
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,759
see on the permit uh but we might may

657
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,839
have some other ladybird species

658
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:21,359
available on the market this year um

659
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:24,959
more to report on that um and also which

660
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:28,359
this is kind of important um if you're

661
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:32,278
looking for ladybug alternatives

662
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:35,639
micromus which are the brown lace wings

663
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:41,519
um beneficial inory and applied

664
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:44,038
bionomics now have permits for the US um

665
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,919
it's not that it's a it's not a new

666
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:48,640
species to the United States it's here

667
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,278
already in the environment it's that

668
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,600
they have the permits to sell them here

669
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:59,079
in the

670
00:29:53,599 --> 00:30:01,480
US um and um it's it's a little bit

671
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:03,639
state byst state basis so you have to

672
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,519
check to see if they're available in

673
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,759
your state but why BR Brown lace wings

674
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:12,640
are

675
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:14,759
interesting is they are as their their

676
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,240
cousins I going use it

677
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,558
usely to to to try to put in perspective

678
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,000
they're kind of like cousins to a Green

679
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:26,278
Lace Wing um but what the difference is

680
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,079
brown lace Wing as adults are predatory

681
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:31,519
Green Lace wings as adult are not

682
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,439
predatory so with brown lace Wings not

683
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,599
only do you get the larvae feeding you

684
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,759
get adults feeding and the adults fly

685
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,359
around they're a little

686
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,839
bit the wings are a little bit I don't

687
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,439
know how to describe it they're like not

688
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,079
as long and narrow they're a little

689
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,759
shorter and fatter where their larval

690
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:51,240
stages are a little bit longer and

691
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:52,879
skinnier than Green Lace wings but what

692
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,960
I really hope with these is we'll be

693
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,720
able to release some of the adults out

694
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,440
they'll be able to fly around in crops

695
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,639
and

696
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,519
they are excellent aphid predators and

697
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:04,839
I'm hoping with their size because they

698
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,919
are larger um that they wouldn't get

699
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:09,638
stuck in tricomes but at the same time

700
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,120
there's a chance they could get stuck in

701
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:14,959
your buds just like ladybirds could but

702
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,798
they're big enough that you could you

703
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,919
know remove them uh easily because of

704
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:23,720
their size but it also may be something

705
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:27,639
that will want to use earlier in the

706
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:31,440
crop cycle to help manage uh fuler aphid

707
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:33,359
speed species um so it's all they it's

708
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,639
kind of new on using them we've got I've

709
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:40,359
got one trial going um on Botanical

710
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:42,519
plants at a Botanical Garden in Georgia

711
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:45,439
we're doing a test there because they've

712
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,880
got birds in the area and so they can't

713
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,200
use any pesticides um so we are doing

714
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,240
some trials now with them um I have not

715
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,759
had any of my cannabis scorers use them

716
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,319
yet but I'm hoping we can not I'm not

717
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,919
hoping for a cannabis squore problems

718
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,558
but waiting for an

719
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:08,679
outbreak of of either cotton melon aphid

720
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:11,240
or cannabis aphid um to see if we uh

721
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,320
release some adults how well they'll do

722
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,200
in the system one of the drawbacks is is

723
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,638
there's almost zero information on

724
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,880
pesticide compatibility where there's

725
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:23,319
seems to be a lot more information on uh

726
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,600
you know the Green Lace

727
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:28,359
wings um and other commercially reared

728
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,918
beneficial since this is so new there's

729
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:35,199
not much information available on it um

730
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:39,080
also the permits have come through now

731
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,240
for anisus which is uh the whirly gig

732
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:44,199
Mite um if you're outside during the

733
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,240
summertime and you like look down on the

734
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,200
sidewalk and you see a m running in

735
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,240
circle crazy patterns um that's the

736
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,720
whirly gig Mite um I find him in Florida

737
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,399
all the time on hibiscus uh I sometimes

738
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,720
find them in trees it is a larger

739
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:05,199
predatory frite that looks more like a

740
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:08,798
crab um but um applied bionomics uh did

741
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,080
get the permit for them to come into not

742
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,119
every state but certain states in the

743
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:16,199
United States and again we're setting up

744
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,599
some trials right now it's generally

745
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,960
going to be more of an aphid Predator

746
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,759
even though they can feed on thrips the

747
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,079
concerning thing about this one is it is

748
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:29,638
very non-selective and it will Le your

749
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:32,678
predators just as much as it would eat

750
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:35,199
your pest but if you if it eats your

751
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:38,320
other beneficials to maintain its own

752
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,038
population you know I kind of you know

753
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,359
I'm kind of okay with that as long as

754
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:45,519
they're controlling um the other pest

755
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:49,479
but again zero pesticide compatibility

756
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,839
information and it's still so new um

757
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,599
that we really is it going to be happy

758
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,879
on cannabis don't know is it going to be

759
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,000
happy on tropical foliage don't really

760
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,159
know we've got to you know trial and

761
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,398
test all this stuff um to see how it's

762
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,679
going to work out in the real

763
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,918
world oh that's great I love hearing

764
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,519
that there's new stuff coming along and

765
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:14,158
for those just to go back to the

766
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:15,519
ladybugs ladybirds uh the reason we we

767
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,200
don't want to be buying them is because

768
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,398
they're wild harvested they can spread

769
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,279
disease to Native ladybug populations

770
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:23,918
even though they're the same species if

771
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,399
you want to read more about it they're

772
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,000
they're the same species but remember

773
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:28,319
they're the just like cannabis has

774
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,358
different strains

775
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,159
the ladybird beetles even though it's a

776
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:33,559
species because it's hippodamia

777
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,519
convergence and you you know if you're

778
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,119
in Virginia you're like oh hippodamia

779
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,599
convergence here it is a different

780
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,720
strain of hippodamia convergence that is

781
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,919
on the East Coast so you're you know

782
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:49,158
you're a as science goes on and we're

783
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,398
there's more molecular work and genetics

784
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,280
and all that happening you know you're

785
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:54,918
going to really un we're going to

786
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,440
understand more

787
00:34:54,918 --> 00:35:01,239
how we need you know

788
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,119
basically more taxonomic levels breaking

789
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:06,598
down even further I mean you know we do

790
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,119
have subspecies and and things like that

791
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,039
but we're really starting to understand

792
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:14,119
it more but you know I always relate to

793
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:16,400
plants you know Acer rubri red maple the

794
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,599
ones growing in in Maine and the ones

795
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,160
growing in Florida those are not the

796
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,320
same plants you can't dig that one up

797
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,039
from Maine and send it to Florida and

798
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,039
the Florida one and send it to main

799
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,679
they're not going to do well so we

800
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,079
definitely have to think about that with

801
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:32,199
insects and just like Bavaria basana now

802
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,359
you have the strains of Bavaria it's

803
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:37,358
more than Bavaria basana is it the ant

804
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:38,799
strain is it the GHA strain same when

805
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,239
you're getting

806
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,960
into um insects I mean like pilus

807
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,719
commercially there's several different

808
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,000
pilus strains on the market phyto cilus

809
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:52,879
pilus is not phyto cilus pilus um there

810
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,800
was some very interesting research done

811
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,599
by um a friend of mine where she

812
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,440
actually looked at can cannibalism rates

813
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,800
between the different commercial strains

814
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,400
of pmus and there are actually different

815
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,599
cannibalism rates between the different

816
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,720
colonies which are basically different

817
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,720
strains or cultivars to put into to uh

818
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,078
plant

819
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:18,759
terms that's I wasn't aware that that

820
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,039
applied with insects as well as with uh

821
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,680
plants because I think of it from a

822
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:26,480
microbial perspective like micro risal

823
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,639
uh inoculant Riso fagus irregularis is

824
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,240
not the same from different companies so

825
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:34,039
you and sub one particular spray and may

826
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:35,559
have offer better drought resistance um

827
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:37,679
may be able to survive in a different

828
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,159
range of abiotic conditions than another

829
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,279
one so trying one if it doesn't work

830
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,960
doesn't mean that micro risal fungi

831
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,440
couldn't work in your environment it

832
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,480
just may mean that you need to try a

833
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,920
different strain out and it sounds like

834
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,960
the same could be said for

835
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,838
insects well the thing with the insect

836
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,119
is is is I mean the damage is kind of

837
00:36:53,838 --> 00:37:00,039
done because of everybody buying them

838
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:02,880
and shipping them around but um back if

839
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:06,239
you go back into the 90s um back when I

840
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,880
actually sold beneficials um uh we used

841
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:12,759
to sell uh one of our one of our native

842
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,599
species comum Milla macula and we

843
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,160
actually had they they sold different

844
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,599
strains of it or different cultivars

845
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,879
whatever term you want to use for

846
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,519
Association but depending on what part

847
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,680
of the country you were in so there was

848
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,838
like a West Coast one and there was an

849
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,159
East Coast one so if you in Pennsylvania

850
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,480
you'd get the East Coast if you're in

851
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:35,759
California you get the West Coast they

852
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:40,800
had actually different colonies um to

853
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,400
have the right one and they've just with

854
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,160
and now it's a hot mess from all the

855
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,160
plants moving around people moving bugs

856
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,480
around I mean again the whole rly poy

857
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,960
thing you know with all the hobby

858
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,440
trading and this and that you know it's

859
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,519
going to be hard to even track any of

860
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,200
all this um because humans have just

861
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:02,199
moved all this stuff around without a

862
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:03,919
thought a care and of the environmental

863
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,960
impact and essentially what you're

864
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,200
saying is we don't know what the

865
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,960
ecological impact may be and we've made

866
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:14,799
this mistake in the past with uh

867
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,599
introducing species to a to a new

868
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,440
environment and causing problems I I

869
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,318
think of Hawaii as a great example of

870
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,039
that but yeah I mean Hawai is a good ex

871
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:27,920
I me Florida Florida gets um One new

872
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,599
invasive a month I I think is the

873
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,720
current going rate and the thing is is

874
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,280
is like everybody knows about you know

875
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:37,118
the problem with like the iguanas in

876
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Florida and everybody knows the pro the

877
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,000
problem with pythons in Florida because

878
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,160
they're big and it's very easy to see

879
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,039
with the insect stuff and even microbial

880
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:51,159
stuff we don't see it so directly so

881
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:53,639
people don't think about how harmful it

882
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:55,639
could be but it's one of these things

883
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,440
that I think one of these times

884
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,838
something bad's going to happen and it's

885
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,000
it's going to catch up and even though

886
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,679
everybody's intentions are good people

887
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,440
need to stop and think about where

888
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:09,679
they're sourcing all this stuff from and

889
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,599
should it be here or not um granted a

890
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,039
lot of mistakes were made early on uh

891
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,599
with moving stuff around you know the

892
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:19,960
can toads released in Florida for

893
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:22,200
control of pests in sugar cane big

894
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,119
mistake again happened a long time ago I

895
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,279
always compare it to Medical Science

896
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,079
because Medical Science again when we

897
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,760
had our last the Spanish Flu our last

898
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,560
big world pandemic problem they were

899
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,119
bloodletting giving whiskey enemas we

900
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,920
were doing all kinds of crazy stuff that

901
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,760
doesn't mean we throw all medical

902
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,519
science out and don't do it because they

903
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,240
made mistakes years ago we learn from it

904
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,480
and try not to repeat those mistakes but

905
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,078
unfortunately when it comes to the

906
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,838
insects and the other arthropods and

907
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:59,160
things and microbes since it's so

908
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:02,599
small we don't see it the same way we do

909
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,598
as with like hey I've got mice in my

910
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,519
yard I'm going to go buy some cheetahs

911
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,680
from Africa and release them nobody

912
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:13,679
would think to do that um and it's it's

913
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:17,199
weird why people aren't concerned as

914
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:20,159
much about moving arthropods around I

915
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:23,078
mean the government is but not Growers

916
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,679
because a lot of I know there's a lot of

917
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,680
legal movement of arthropods in this

918
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,679
country

919
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,838
so some of these more exotic species of

920
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,440
isopods probably are not legal to sell

921
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:37,759
just because of the risk of them getting

922
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,679
out and we don't know what the

923
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,040
ecological implications are but also at

924
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:46,639
the same time the government doesn't

925
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:49,119
have the capacity to really enforce or

926
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,279
regulate as well as they probably should

927
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,440
for this sort of thing right right no

928
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,079
they they don't have the manpower to do

929
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,838
it and to move the isopods R you do have

930
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,640
to have permits you can't just ship them

931
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,519
around there's a permitting process

932
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:07,078
involved just like with uh the

933
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:09,400
commercial beneficial insects pimus Cuca

934
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,318
Merit you those things there are permits

935
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,838
and that is all regulated by the USDA to

936
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:19,119
make sure people aren't moving invasive

937
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:24,000
things around um

938
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:26,039
but with the the pet trade of of uh

939
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,920
these other arthropods it's it's there's

940
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:30,119
all these shows

941
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,519
that you can go buy stuff at and this

942
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,160
you know it's it's just there's not

943
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,280
enough

944
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,118
government they don't have the manpower

945
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,960
to regulate all of this and I think

946
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,000
we're setting ourselves up for some

947
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,720
serious problems down the road and how

948
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,838
the best way to stop this stuff is you

949
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,318
know make sure if you're buying

950
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,358
something do you have the right permits

951
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:54,480
is this legal for me to buy and be a

952
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,799
better human and don't be like oh the

953
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,440
government's just you know trying to

954
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,519
control us and there's a reason why this

955
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,599
stuff is in place to prevent these major

956
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,920
problems we've had with invasives in the

957
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,720
past and be a better human being and

958
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,039
think about the impact down the road of

959
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:12,919
what you're doing not just what's right

960
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:12,920
in front of your face

961
