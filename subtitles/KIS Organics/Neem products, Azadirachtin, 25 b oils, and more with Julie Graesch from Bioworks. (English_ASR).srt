1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,699
all right so I'm here with Julie gresh

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:09,300
from bioworks and she did a presentation

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,099
yesterday on neem and azadaractin and I

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,480
put up a quick post on my story and

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,820
there were a lot of questions about it

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
so I tracked her down and I thought we

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,778
could do a little

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,239
short little mini session on Neiman as

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,259
direct and so thanks for taking the time

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,899
to do this

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,480
and thank you Ted I appreciate it

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,538
um yeah so why don't we start off with

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,500
how the neem tree gets processed just a

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:39,058
real quick explanation on that so the

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:42,960
seed the fruit is small almost Olive

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:45,179
shaped and it as it progresses to

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,640
maturity it goes to this nice yellow

18
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,759
orange color and it will fall from the

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,960
tree where it's harvested and

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,619
the neem seed has after the fruit

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,259
um

22
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:03,119
flesh has been removed you're left with

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:04,978
the the kernel and it does have a hole

24
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,298
on it which needs to be removed like a

25
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,239
pistachio

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,540
so once that's removed you get the the

27
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:17,519
kernel or the seed which is either

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:21,540
solvent extracted or also pressed to

29
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:24,840
remove the oil and from that oil you

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,100
have that the raw oil it you have an

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,439
additional

32
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,099
process where it's separated into two

33
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:35,099
different products one is Asda actin and

34
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,919
one is clarified hydrophobic extract of

35
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,478
neem oil since that's a lot of words and

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
most people don't like to say a lot of

37
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,978
words it is shortened off and down to

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,099
just saying neem oil

39
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,078
so it's really important to note that a

40
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,839
neem oil product does not have acid or

41
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:55,019
actin and a nasider actin product does

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,420
not have neem oil however there are some

43
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,399
combo products that may have both

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,420
depending

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,060
um so

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,780
it's important to make sure you look at

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,000
the label to ensure that you are

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,318
when you're wanting to purchase do you

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,080
want a neem oil

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,659
for Suffocation or do you want acid or

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,099
actin that will have additional

52
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,959
insecticidal capabilities

53
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:21,959
and those neem oil products are

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,378
typically formulated in an oil like a

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:29,159
sunflower oil and those will then help

56
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:31,859
facilitate the the application and the

57
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,199
spread and the absorption of that

58
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,260
chemical into the insect's cuticle which

59
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,318
there can be some contact

60
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:43,679
efficacy but um mainly it needs to be

61
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,318
ingested for maximum efficacy

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,360
as interactive the azador ACT incorrect

63
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,579
okay so with the neem oil it's

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,440
Suffocation or cuticle disruption which

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,780
you're gonna have a little bit of that

66
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,878
with the azidaractin products as well

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,140
because oftentimes they're formulated in

68
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,679
oil

69
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:05,399
but not neem oil so what what is

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,800
uniquely special about neem oil then if

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,400
as a compared to other oils

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:17,159
if anything so they're

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:20,819
um there can be so Anem is the neem

74
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:23,579
oil comes from a Botanical source so you

75
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,339
can have a product like soft oil X that

76
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,099
is

77
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:33,719
made from a Horticultural mineral oil

78
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:35,639
and that is different than something

79
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,459
that is botanically produced so it's

80
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,279
produced from something in nature this

81
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,158
neem tree the seed that we talked about

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,878
so in a um

83
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:50,699
each of those can be highly efficacious

84
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,679
and it will have their place and you can

85
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,539
oftentimes even use those in rotation

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,840
just depending on you know what your

87
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,818
goals are and what insects may be on the

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,519
label or even what diseases or mites are

89
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:05,359
on those labels so again make sure you

90
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,158
read the label because not all of them

91
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,500
will be targeting the same insects mites

92
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,060
and some of these products are also

93
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,620
fungicidal

94
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:20,280
so I would say there are differences in

95
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,800
the oils and a reason you may choose say

96
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,918
a neem oil over

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,040
a Horticultural mineral oil is that it

98
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,620
is plant-based and there is going to

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,520
it's going to be

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,639
more

101
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,680
complex I would say than something that

102
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,500
is more of a pure

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,160
mineral oil

104
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,259
and there's going to be several

105
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,460
compounds that come from the tree with

106
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,600
that

107
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,299
um but again there it it's it's

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,320
fundamentally different you know from a

109
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,139
Horticultural mineral oil from a neem

110
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,360
oil so try them both

111
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,540
see what works best for you sometimes

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,060
like I said they are used in rotation I

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,699
wouldn't tank mix them but they can be

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,800
used in rotation especially if you're

115
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,199
trying to Target specifically things

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,699
that are on the label

117
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,919
okay and uh neem oil is uh EPA regulated

118
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,259
products or registered products sorry

119
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,719
and some of these other oils like some

120
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,879
of the time all time products lavender

121
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,919
those are all 25b products so there's a

122
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:33,779
little more regulation around neem

123
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:36,180
as well so your acid or actin products

124
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:41,879
your neem products and your combo

125
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:44,340
products will all be found listed in at

126
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,199
the Environmental Protection Agency EPA

127
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,399
and

128
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,038
um

129
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,978
there are a number of

130
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:56,639
neem and acid or actin-based products

131
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,740
that do have hemp on the label and you

132
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,759
can go on to the EPA website and look

133
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,160
for product search as a directin or neem

134
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,680
oil or clarified hydrophobic extract of

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,780
neem oil and it should pull up and hemp

136
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,300
and it should pull you up that that

137
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,339
short list I think there's around 10 to

138
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,699
15 different

139
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,899
[Music]

140
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,860
um

141
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:24,538
uh labels that are listed on the EPA now

142
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,120
at the state level there may be

143
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:31,318
additional products that the states have

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,660
approved for use so do look at your

145
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:38,699
state to see if you you do have maybe

146
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,800
more options now as far as the 25 B's

147
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,639
those are

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
um

149
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,879
considered safe by the NOP or national

150
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,379
organic program

151
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,800
and because those are considered safe to

152
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:58,259
humans and crops

153
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,079
they have less regulations associated

154
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:06,600
with them many of them are essential oil

155
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:09,918
based and as Tad said they could be a

156
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,660
time oil based or peppermint oil

157
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,159
rosemary oil sometimes you'll have a

158
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,699
combination of many of these different

159
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,560
oils they do have an odor to them and

160
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,560
they can work through

161
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,240
um not only just the Suffocation but you

162
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:30,839
can also have some Direct effects on the

163
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,720
insects it may disrupt you know some

164
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,959
sort of insect physiology just depending

165
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,060
on what oil it it essential oil is in

166
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,698
those 25 B products

167
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,740
there's also an odor associated with it

168
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,199
some people depending again on the

169
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,780
central oil can think that it is a

170
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,580
pleasant odor other people don't think

171
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,619
it's a pleasant odor that does seem to

172
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,859
be a little bit dependent on the people

173
00:07:52,620 --> 00:08:00,240
but it's it's not an offending like

174
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:03,479
maybe a chemical smell would be so

175
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,639
um but again those are 25b products and

176
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,740
they're not registered with the EPA so

177
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,180
there are less regulations associated

178
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,240
with them

179
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,620
um maybe many of them don't even have a

180
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,139
PPE requirements although I would always

181
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,500
tell you that it's important to wear PPE

182
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:25,680
such as gloves while making the

183
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,319
application maybe just like a a dust

184
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,418
mask or something so you're not inhaling

185
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,899
particles and that sort of thing safety

186
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:38,819
should always be first when dealing with

187
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:40,979
any kind of spray so in addition to the

188
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,839
Suffocation or maybe some sort of

189
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,320
physiological effects with the insect

190
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,860
that odor can make insects not also not

191
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,720
like it and so they may

192
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,120
disappear they may try to go to a

193
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,920
different plant they may leave the if

194
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,720
it's a greenhouse if it's a grow

195
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,338
obviously you know there's only so far

196
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,339
for them to go but they may not come

197
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,140
back to the plant so they would then at

198
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,260
that point starve so there's a neem oil

199
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:09,659
might have that effect too

200
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:11,159
and one thing on 25b products I want to

201
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,278
mention is there's no requirement for

202
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:17,699
any efficacy data on them so I could mix

203
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:20,639
in my garage rosemary oil

204
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,100
uh peppermint oil and and slap it on a

205
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,620
label and make a product and and pretty

206
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,180
much say that it kills these things but

207
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,980
I don't have to actually prevent private

208
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,139
data so as a consumer you guys have to

209
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,100
be very careful

210
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,139
absolutely and thank you for bringing

211
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,800
that up what

212
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:40,319
you could do what you just said and

213
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:44,419
um however companies

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,940
that produce 25 bees have scientists

215
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:51,360
research and development that formulate

216
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,720
these products together and have very

217
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,600
specific ratios and there is

218
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,440
um for the

219
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,500
reputable companies there is or should

220
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,860
be some research and development that

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:12,080
has been done to ensure that you have a

222
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:15,720
good Emulsion of the essential oils with

223
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,759
various formulation components that is

224
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,920
going to make a good product and most

225
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:24,480
importantly that that product will not

226
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:28,079
say burn the crop or cause any other and

227
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,060
correct phytotoxicity crop tolerance and

228
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,500
potentially a number of other things and

229
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,359
that's obviously really important you

230
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,278
don't want to burn your crop so if you

231
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,120
mix something up in your own basement

232
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:41,820
and try to apply it to your plant it may

233
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,159
not mix in water very well it may want

234
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,560
to just float right up to the surface a

235
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:49,620
lot of the essential oils are very

236
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:53,338
volatile and so if you put it into water

237
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,200
it may just volatilize and go poof so

238
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,839
many of these essential oils have been

239
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,959
formulated to almost encapsulate the

240
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,240
essential oils so it doesn't volatilize

241
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,458
until it gets to the plant where it's

242
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,940
going to have that efficacy

243
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:10,439
so it's more complicated

244
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,019
than just

245
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,519
you know putting putting some of these

246
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,179
things together and applying it to your

247
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,820
plant there are dangers with doing that

248
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,219
um and I think mainly you know crop

249
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,339
damage being the the biggest concern so

250
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:30,420
so getting back to the neem stuff

251
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,160
we carry a cold pressed neem product

252
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,059
um

253
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,719
you don't know that know that but we do

254
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:38,939
uh and um one of the things around that

255
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
as you mentioned it does have a level it

256
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,360
can potentially have levels of azure

257
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,919
direct and I know originally I had the

258
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,079
manufacturer send me

259
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,179
stuff and it showed you know the PPM of

260
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,979
azure act and in the product so when you

261
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,539
said Nemo didn't contain Azure actin

262
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,459
that kind of surprised me and then you

263
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:54,419
mentioned this cold pressing

264
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,979
um

265
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,620
so

266
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,440
I I guess my question around that is the

267
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,360
neem cake and the neem oil if it's cold

268
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,700
pressed will have

269
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,480
some as a direct and level but it'll be

270
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:13,800
exponentially lower than the pure acid

271
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,899
or actin product is that correct so the

272
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:20,519
the cold-pressed name is basically

273
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:23,399
that kernel that we talked about earlier

274
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:28,259
it's pressed the seed or the kernel is

275
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,519
about 40 oil so with that comes all of

276
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:30,360
the

277
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,360
um

278
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,360
compounds

279
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,600
um that are in there and acid or actin

280
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,639
is actually Collective term

281
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,620
um because it is Botanical you have more

282
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,899
than just Hazard act and Aster actin is

283
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,000
the most insecticidally active and

284
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,759
highest concentration of those various

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,639
compounds that is now known as acid or

286
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,519
actin so you get depending on the seed

287
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:01,259
quality you can have anywhere from 300

288
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:03,379
to I think 2500 parts per million as a

289
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:06,958
directin from

290
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:11,220
a cold-pressed neem oil or the raw neem

291
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:14,099
oil and so for instance with an azador

292
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,899
actin product it can be anywhere from

293
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,820
0.15 or less if for homeowners

294
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:24,839
up to about six percent acid or actin

295
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,500
and so like Tad said it's exponentially

296
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,920
higher for an Azar actin product

297
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,100
um with with as a interacting in it now

298
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,559
with your cold pressed neem oils

299
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,379
you're only going to have a few hundred

300
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,899
to maybe a few thousand parts per

301
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,240
million astero actin so your main mode

302
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,278
of action really with a cold pressed is

303
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,320
going to be the Neema oil it is

304
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,720
basically more of a neem oil than it is

305
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,180
an acid or actin product but you do you

306
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,339
will have some of those still in there

307
00:13:54,179 --> 00:14:01,078
and potentially get a little bit of

308
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:05,160
additional benefit than a pure

309
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:08,039
neem oil product because those those

310
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:11,778
Tetra terpenes haven't been removed and

311
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:14,578
one other thing from Suzanne it was that

312
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:16,259
beneficial insects you may need to wait

313
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,739
to do a release with some of these more

314
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:23,220
uh pungent oils because the beneficials

315
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:26,159
may not want to uh colonize or infect on

316
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,660
the leaf surface as compared to like a

317
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,919
horticultural oil so I just want to

318
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,759
throw that in for folks because that's

319
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,799
something

320
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,679
Suzanne has shared research on in the

321
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,859
past yeah so your essential oils and

322
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,198
your neem oil products or anything that

323
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,539
has a lot of fragrance to it or may have

324
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,539
a mode of action associated with

325
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,539
repellency

326
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:53,040
not only may it repel the insects that

327
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:55,500
you don't want but it may also repel the

328
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,099
beneficial insects now

329
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,278
um

330
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,060
those benefits those those effects are

331
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,980
typically fairly short-lived so

332
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,619
um maybe a little bit longer than what

333
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,800
you can smell because insects are very

334
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,600
sensitive to the odors and so on the

335
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,979
leaf surface level you may have

336
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,959
additional

337
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,778
um

338
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,979
odor and repellency then what you can

339
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:22,320
detect

340
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,480
but I would say that

341
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,000
um if you're planning a timing is

342
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,759
everything with making spray

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,820
applications of biopesticides and using

344
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,220
beneficial insects so it in it's

345
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,600
important that as you plan out your

346
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,019
program

347
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,180
um and if you are wanting to if you see

348
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,919
an increase in the number of insects

349
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,259
that you want to maybe Target with the

350
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,500
spray and you want to use a neem oil or

351
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,120
a 25 B product and you're using

352
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,000
beneficials as well and you don't want

353
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,940
to kill those beneficials typically the

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,259
best timing would be before your next

355
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,980
release

356
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:06,838
so that and I would for your neem oils

357
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,720
for 25 bees I would leave a good I would

358
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,420
say at least three day buffer maybe

359
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,820
longer three to five day buffer before

360
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,039
you you make your next release just to

361
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,260
ensure that you're not killing off those

362
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,419
beneficials that you're releasing which

363
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,059
you don't want to do is release and then

364
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:28,139
do a spray because even a water spray

365
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:30,419
can kill a beneficial so just being very

366
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,299
cognizant of the timing of your

367
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,338
applications of both your bio pesticides

368
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,240
and your natural enemies is going to be

369
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:42,420
really important and that's the best way

370
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,778
to develop these programs to ensure that

371
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:48,120
you get the best bang for your buck both

372
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:50,220
bio pesticide and natural enemy

373
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,980
what are the risks associated with

374
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,040
azador actin products I know

375
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,920
um they're harmful to Aquatic

376
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:01,019
Aquatic Life marine life so you don't

377
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,179
want to use them around water are there

378
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,980
any other are they the mode of action

379
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:06,139
with them is a is are there a neural

380
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,900
disruptor

381
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,299
they are mainly as a direct and huh

382
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,240
anti-fedient what yeah there's

383
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,699
anti-fedient and repellency properties

384
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,578
those are typically dose dependent and

385
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,318
short-lived so typically

386
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,359
um as we just mentioned with the natural

387
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,740
enemies

388
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:30,178
the higher the dose the longer the

389
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:33,120
response may be and that typically is

390
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,620
only going to last a couple of days at

391
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,798
most

392
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:41,219
so the other mode of action specifically

393
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,900
with acid directin is that it's an

394
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,240
insect growth regulator which means

395
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,820
they're mainly targeting juvenile

396
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,259
insects and

397
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:50,339
those

398
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,919
um

399
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,779
those juvenile insects are

400
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,460
um your target so you want to make sure

401
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,678
that juvenile insects are there at the

402
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,200
time of application and that you're not

403
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:06,000
targeting your adults because adults

404
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,140
will not be impacted or much less so

405
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,940
um

406
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,919
I went off on a tangent what was the

407
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,440
original question uh any risks

408
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,100
associated with azador acting thank you

409
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,100
um so

410
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,740
um

411
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,460
mode of action is insect growth

412
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,519
regulator so

413
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,519
um

414
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:32,660
I'm sorry you can come back to it

415
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
um

416
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:38,640
yeah ask another question because I um

417
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,980
or ask the same question again just so I

418
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,900
can just as interacting products what

419
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,339
are the are there risks associated with

420
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,798
them

421
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:50,038
as opposed to like using neem oil or

422
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,139
Seth oil or some of these other uh

423
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:56,460
pesticides

424
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,059
so nemes neem and Azure actin products

425
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,460
are a safe

426
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:06,000
really low mammalian toxicity as Tad

427
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,519
mentioned if you apply any product that

428
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,259
is oil based to water it's going to

429
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:15,298
create an oil slick so it's going to be

430
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:15,298
toxic to fish also invertebrate

431
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,340
um uh insects in the water will be

432
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:23,759
harmed by the asterect and

433
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:27,418
so that's a concern if you directly

434
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,919
spray the beneficials there may be some

435
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,980
impact

436
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,960
just because it's a spray if the if your

437
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,640
beneficial insect sips from the plant

438
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,640
there could be some

439
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,980
impact to the more impact to those

440
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,739
insects than the insects that purely

441
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,200
just eat insects as a food source some

442
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,919
beneficials will sip from the plant

443
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,620
um

444
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,000
so there could be a little bit of more

445
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:57,899
impact for those but for the most part

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,480
most beneficials are not harmed by as

447
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,679
direct and if it is

448
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,200
um

449
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,080
if it is a neem oil though of course

450
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,179
there's that Suffocation factor and or

451
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,460
formulated in an oil there is a

452
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,140
Suffocation Factor so once again you

453
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,538
want to try to minimize as much as

454
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:20,660
possible contact with your natural

455
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:20,660
enemies to avoid that risk

456
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,120
um

457
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,020
great well I think we covered quite a

458
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,459
bit

459
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,619
um so I really appreciate it thank you

460
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,519
for for doing that today thank you Chad

461
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:31,519
I appreciate it
