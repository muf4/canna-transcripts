create sustainable systems I'd like to

58
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,859
welcome to the show thanks dr. Faust for

59
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:20,769
taking the time to chat with me today

60
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,740
and I'd love to dive right in with a

61
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,560
little bit of your personal history in

62
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,770
terms of how you came to work with humic

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,960
acids and a little more about that well

64
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:38,439
I come from Southeast Pennsylvania and

65
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:42,280
you know my family had a farm and it's

66
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:44,349
it's I grew up in the city I went to the

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,080
farm on the weekends my grandfather's

68
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:50,049
farm so I was highly influenced by being

69
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,990
around it I guess I just got on the

70
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,060
organic movement I was like one of the

71
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:59,409
first people involved in bio dynamics

72
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,650
and organics was me back in the 60s but

73
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:04,659
I went to the University of Delaware and

74
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,959
studied entomology and applied ecology

75
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:11,289
and just about every other science they

76
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,849
offered that was back in Vietnam days so

77
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:16,629
we wanted to stay in as long as possible

78
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:18,579
so I grew up in Wilmington Delaware

79
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,280
which is the chemical capital of the

80
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,910
world and I didn't want to go that

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:30,189
direction I wanted to be the alternative

82
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:32,769
to toxic technology so I started farming

83
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:35,650
while I was still in finishing college

84
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,170
running our family farm and started you

85
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,390
know be an organic grower a member of

86
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:44,049
the biodynamic Association trying to

87
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:47,439
understand biodynamic farming which of

88
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,239
course relies on houmous so through the

89
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,400
years my whole goal was to provide

90
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,400
alternatives to toxic technology because

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,969
I saw what damage could be done by

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,450
synthetic pesticides and herbicides and

93
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:06,129
relying on that technology you know and

94
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:08,439
which is unsustainable so at one point I

95
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:11,739
decided to move west this was in the

96
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:15,489
early 70s and I bought a small piece of

97
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,530
land in Montana Flathead Valley and I

98
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,298
wanted to improve the soil because it

99
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,638
was over grazed it was hard

100
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:27,538
you know I wanted to raise purebred

101
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,699
sheep and so I was looking for a way of

102
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:32,339
improving that soil and I noticed a

103
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,220
little ad in Montana farmer Stockman

104
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:40,109
magazine and it had an advertisement for

105
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:44,729
clod Buster soil softener supreme it's a

106
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,500
human and so I called him up this is

107
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:51,800
before the internet so yeah I did call

108
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:54,899
people and it was magazine type articles

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,538
of course I was describing organic farm

110
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:01,049
and garden magazine that influenced me a

111
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:04,560
lot but I talked to the supplier of this

112
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,569
so-called clod Buster humate and I'd

113
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,780
never heard the term humate I know what

114
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:14,669
houmous was but I didn't what Hugh made

115
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:18,869
was so they sent me a small sample maybe

116
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:21,829
a couple ounces and I set up took some

117
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:25,468
of my soil put it in pots I had a little

118
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:29,218
greenhouse and I dope and I set up test

119
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:31,228
plots with sweet corn with and without

120
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:33,449
you know putting a pinch of course we

121
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:35,758
didn't even know how much to use then

122
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,550
putting a good pinch on an honest four

123
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,658
inch pot they didn't and then planting

124
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:46,710
corn and then having control untreated

125
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:49,529
control and the results were dramatic

126
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:53,899
within two or three weeks germination

127
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:57,568
was quicker the shoot the plant itself

128
00:05:53,899 --> 00:06:00,508
the corn was bigger I mean it was

129
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:03,060
outgrowing the control the root system

130
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,699
when you wash the soil off was extensive

131
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,740
I said well this stuff does something

132
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,348
okay so that's where it all started a

133
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,788
little sample overall humate

134
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:15,839
from New Mexico you started out with

135
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:17,879
essentially learning about humates from

136
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,068
trying out this product where did that

137
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,538
research take you had you already done

138
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,360
your doctorate at that point already

139
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:27,658
does oh no no no no no that's a long

140
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,788
time after I wasn't until 1986 this was

141
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:33,599
like my first experience with humates

142
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:38,709
wasn't like 73 74

143
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,230
and actually it got me into the next

144
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:44,039
level you know a master's in agronomy

145
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:47,470
and then a PhD in biotechnology and

146
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,770
agroecology so it sort of fed my

147
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,380
scientific curiosity because here's a

148
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:57,430
product which the university system says

149
00:06:53,379 --> 00:07:00,519
nothing about never mentioned and if you

150
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,639
did mention it to an academic I saw wow

151
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:05,649
that's that can't work you know you're

152
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,079
not putting on enough per acre that it

153
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:09,099
could do anything and you know that's

154
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,859
snake oil

155
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,980
but I knew different because my eyeball

156
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,639
I use the scientific method here's the

157
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:21,910
experiment it's doing something so don't

158
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,689
tell me it isn't my eyeballs tell me and

159
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:30,070
the fact that the negativity surrounding

160
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:34,779
humans or humic substances in American

161
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:38,079
academia just stimulated me more because

162
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:39,729
I knew what it was doing and the fact

163
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:44,079
that they were suppressing that

164
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:47,410
information or actually you know

165
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:50,349
negative going negative on it made me

166
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,340
even more interested what's going on

167
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:56,890
here you know so I went to the next

168
00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:00,189
level because I was working with with

169
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,659
farmers in the seed potato industry you

170
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,079
know I was involved in seed industry

171
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,420
they seed potato seed beans as an

172
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,389
agronomist as a advisor pest control

173
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,230
advisor so I had a client to grew seed

174
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:15,129
potatoes and these are very sensitive to

175
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:19,180
everything you had to produce it's got

176
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:23,980
to be disease-free certifications and

177
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:28,000
all that so we bought a truckload 20 ton

178
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:31,090
24 tons of this humate material from New

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,460
Mexico and we did test plots 20 acre

180
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:37,659
test plots 20 acres with 20 acres

181
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:40,360
without on potatoes seed potatoes okay

182
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:42,189
now what I saw right to the RO and I

183
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,019
still have the pictures of this which

184
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,050
I'm going to present at a conference

185
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:50,230
this fall American Society

186
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:52,719
Arata me and what happened there was we

187
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:58,089
had a lot of leaf damage the feeding

188
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,790
activity on the untreated potato plot 20

189
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:04,120
acres and then right to the row I mean

190
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:07,659
where we applied the humic acid humate

191
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,589
product there was little if any insect

192
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:14,919
damage at all I mean plants right next

193
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:18,779
to each other one row over no insect

194
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:21,490
averages back over to the right you know

195
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:24,789
lepidopterist defoliator holes like

196
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,490
Swiss cheese in these plants and then of

197
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:29,740
course the plants were more vigorous and

198
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,289
the treated side and they yield higher

199
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,379
okay so that obviously got me interested

200
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:37,809
I mean as an idealistic young guy who

201
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:41,139
wanted to provide alternatives to toxic

202
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:43,419
technology I saw something there that

203
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,409
was amazing I put this stuff on I don't

204
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,969
know what it is

205
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:52,990
and somehow the insects

206
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:54,610
it provided a level of resistance to

207
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,470
potatoes I mean this could be an

208
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:01,089
incredibly important thing for the

209
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:04,540
organic industry so is the pest it's

210
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,920
like a pest control advisors dream you

211
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:08,889
know you can put this stuff on the

212
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,899
ground get better growth resist insects

213
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:13,750
and get higher yield Wow

214
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:18,370
you know but nevertheless the folks

215
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:21,458
Montana State University who I knew you

216
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,220
know they they just discounted it oh no

217
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,958
you know how much you using per acre and

218
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,350
of course those days we were using a raw

219
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:33,309
humate product unprocessed dusty kind of

220
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:36,009
messy and we're using - 200 pounds or

221
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,409
more per acre - to - up to 400 pounds an

222
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:40,389
acre and so they're saying wow there's

223
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:44,278
not enough houmous organic matter in

224
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:47,470
that to do anything so based on their

225
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,289
limited knowledge really since they

226
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:54,060
couldn't really wrap their minds around

227
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:56,639
how it was working they just denied it

228
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:59,379
that it could do anything you know like

229
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,549
well there it is there's a result well

230
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:04,480
buddy

231
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:07,838
can't work because it just okay but

232
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,550
bottom line is I knew it did and things

233
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,730
just progressed you know and we were

234
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:15,359
involved in many other crops a lot of

235
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,759
potato crops a lot of bean seed a lot of

236
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,240
vegetable crops and I was growing giant

237
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,100
squash in Montana I bring the County

238
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,560
Extension agent over to look at it and

239
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,110
he just stand here with his mouth open

240
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,549
and and I said well what do you think he

241
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,470
says well you're growing stuff that

242
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:35,740
really you shouldn't be able to grow

243
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,560
here in Montana so I just got more and

244
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,379
more involved you know and then I moved

245
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,049
to a larger agricultural area a major

246
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:47,350
agriculture area where I set up a farm

247
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:52,419
services consulting program testing

248
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:55,028
organic certification and an formulation

249
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:58,419
of products an application of products

250
00:11:55,028 --> 00:12:01,958
and so we started using humates in

251
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:05,439
combination on a lot of crops everything

252
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:11,979
from sugar beads to barley to potatoes

253
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:16,600
dry beans corn so a full range of crops

254
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:20,649
and at that time I started doing more

255
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,200
formal research and my research was in

256
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,639
what are the limiting factors what are

257
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,430
the limiting factors that hold back the

258
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,278
yield of crops in other words once these

259
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:32,699
crops have a genetic potential far in

260
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:36,519
excess of what you're actually seeing

261
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,950
done so what's holding them back and so

262
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,629
my research over the years has been crop

263
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,800
limiting factors and that was part of my

264
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:48,338
master's thesis in agronomy and you know

265
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,599
on beans potatoes barley things like

266
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,120
that common crops

267
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,500
okay what's holding back to you you know

268
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,360
so we get up to yields like 237 bushels

269
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,828
an acre on corn which was really big

270
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,860
time in those days 100 and over 120

271
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:08,528
hundred 60 bushels barley on and on and

272
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,889
on and I talked to older farmers that

273
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:14,139
farmed there and Twin Falls Idaho and

274
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,360
when it first opened up

275
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:19,000
it's irrigated flood irrigated farming

276
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,110
forgetting farming and they talked about

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,509
45 sack beans and now the problem was

278
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:29,800
the the bean yields have dropped to 15

279
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:33,759
sacks 10 sacks from 45 sacks and that a

280
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:36,639
good yield was 25 24 25 well what

281
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,909
happened to the 45 sacks that the

282
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,679
original farmers in that area had so

283
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:48,429
there must be a limiting factor what is

284
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:52,179
it and so over the years we found out by

285
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:56,069
leaf analysis soil analysis and trial

286
00:13:52,179 --> 00:14:00,129
and error that the limiting factors were

287
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:03,790
well not only trace elements but root

288
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:06,759
growth itself the lack of root growth

289
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:08,349
and there was reasons for that part of

290
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,649
it was the use of the herbicides they

291
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:15,850
were using other parts was this is a

292
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:18,370
desert soil and you know that kind of

293
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:22,409
farming oxidizes the organic matter and

294
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,600
the organic matter gets down to below 2%

295
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:28,750
so with the experiments that we did we

296
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,899
found that humic substances apparently

297
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,778
are the limiting factor a major limiting

298
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:37,600
factor and of course since then there's

299
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:40,450
been a lot that's 40 years ago since

300
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,440
then working with other scientists from

301
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:47,050
around the world in doing pretty big

302
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,910
formal trials and tests we found that

303
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:52,599
the main limiting factor on any given

304
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:56,620
soil is activated humic substances or

305
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:01,240
human compounds and mono silicic acid so

306
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:04,269
when those substances are depleted and

307
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,919
organic matter of course is unstable it

308
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:13,419
oxidizes it leaches blows away the

309
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:17,049
yields come down because it's just like

310
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:20,229
when people migrated to the west they'd

311
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:23,439
move into the Midwest Ohio let's say

312
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:27,039
Indiana clear the forests and that was

313
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,939
hardwood like oak and birch in various

314
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,788
hardwood species

315
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:32,828
he's on they would clear that and then

316
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:37,208
they plant and they'd get high yield for

317
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:39,818
a few years and then the yields would be

318
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:43,258
reduced and then they'd move west so it

319
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:51,248
was a constant moving West soil mining

320
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:53,889
and West westward movement and so my

321
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:56,199
whole concept is we either figure this

322
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:59,438
thing out or you know agriculture

323
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:02,558
becomes unsustainable and it's just

324
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:04,389
relying on chemical inputs and you know

325
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:08,499
more and more disease issues and

326
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:13,808
resistance issues problems with

327
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:17,558
production you know a new spray but my

328
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:20,428
background in as a farmer my family had

329
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:24,009
been farming in Pennsylvania since 1733

330
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:27,639
and so you know we had basic grasp of

331
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:31,859
organic methods going way back you know

332
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:36,369
using compost having livestock systems

333
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:38,589
where you compost manure and put it back

334
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:41,349
on crops so you could grow corn to feed

335
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:44,409
your livestock that kind of mixed

336
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:47,919
farming scenario so we knew the value of

337
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:50,759
human compost and then the biodynamic

338
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:55,088
people tried to put some science to that

339
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:59,859
like Pfeiffer dr. Pfeiffer and Steiner

340
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:02,439
and people like that it influenced me so

341
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:05,230
we knew you know I was already kind of

342
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:07,000
sold on the idea of organics because I

343
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,240
kind of grew up with the Amish and

344
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,939
Mennonites and so the results were

345
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,449
obvious matter of fact my first time I

346
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:20,350
use maxi crop kelp on corn was on

347
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:22,058
suggestion of an Amish neighbor and you

348
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:28,928
just couldn't deny him they knew what

349
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:31,119
they're doing but so over the years you

350
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:36,429
know the humane thing I got more and

351
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:40,639
more deeper into it including many many

352
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:44,030
trials in greenhouses and in field crops

353
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,770
row crops specialty crops and tried

354
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:49,069
different deposits from around the world

355
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:51,349
okay so we found out that some of those

356
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,359
deposits don't do anything you know

357
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:55,699
you'd be disappointed but you didn't

358
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,409
know why you know how come this one

359
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,740
doesn't work it's got the same humic

360
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:04,308
acid content as this one let's say from

361
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:07,339
New Mexico versus Wyoming let's say or

362
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:11,899
another location within New Mexico or

363
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:14,058
Utah and as far as we knew based on the

364
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,660
only testing available was just for

365
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:21,319
humic acid which isn't really even a

366
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:24,679
real thing but there was adequate

367
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:28,308
differences either sometimes no results

368
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,950
sometimes negative results so we're

369
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:35,450
looking at a why what's the difference

370
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:38,569
here they all analyzed humic acid some

371
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,390
of them are higher in humic acid like 80

372
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:44,359
percent or so but didn't provide the

373
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,890
results on actual plant growth where

374
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:49,699
there's some of the products that were

375
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:52,040
as low as 25% humic acid had spectacular

376
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,179
results so there's a lot of mysteries

377
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:58,519
involved at that at that point dr. Fox

378
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:01,280
can I pause you for a second for our

379
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,700
listeners could you give a quick

380
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:08,359
definition of the differences between

381
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:11,210
humans humans humic and fulvic acids so

382
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:15,289
that people have an idea of what those

383
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:19,880
differences are you know well humans you

384
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:24,619
know what's gonna form under on let's

385
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,840
say an undisturbed forest it's under the

386
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:29,449
Duff layer you know which is sort of the

387
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:32,949
leaves and the bark and so it's a

388
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:37,190
decomposition of organic matter

389
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:39,259
specifically leaves bark twigs you know

390
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:44,029
the stuff that falls from the forest and

391
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:45,919
is decomposed by fungi okay and it's the

392
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:48,759
same as what would happen in a compost

393
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,970
pile you know it's a range of

394
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:53,660
microorganisms

395
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,019
really dominated by fungal organisms

396
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,529
that can

397
00:19:54,019 --> 00:20:01,339
take apart cellulose and produce an

398
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:05,299
phenol and lignin lignin is a big factor

399
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:09,589
in lignans in bark twigs leaves like oak

400
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:13,099
oak as a high tannin lignin and so some

401
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:14,000
of the best soils word evoke and that's

402
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:18,919
what we see here in the Willamette

403
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,019
Valley - okay so you have microorganisms

404
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:27,019
breaking it down so the definition of

405
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:29,299
human is the raw undecomposed organic

406
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:33,440
matter that you'll find you know next to

407
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:35,690
the soil in the upper profile just a so

408
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,539
the definition I've heard for houmous is

409
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,330
that it's the decomposition of organic

410
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:43,250
matter to the point where under a

411
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:46,399
microscope you can't tell the difference

412
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,480
if that was originally a peat leaf or a

413
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:54,259
dead animal or some other remains and

414
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,819
that he mistakes time so it's not

415
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:58,009
something we're gonna get in a compost

416
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,329
pile in a period of a few months would

417
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,930
you agree with any of those statements

418
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:04,460
oh absolutely absolutely

419
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:07,220
because you have different levels of

420
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,110
humic acids see and then that's where

421
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,430
these different definitions are like

422
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:16,609
fulvic acid humic acid human h um i n

423
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,590
that's an insoluble fraction so it's one

424
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:22,279
of the only substances or chemicals

425
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:24,409
defined as a fraction so humic acid is

426
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,240
not a substance it's not a chemical that

427
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,810
you can analyze and this is humic acid

428
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,140
no humic acid is defined as the alkaline

429
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:36,109
soluble fraction of organic matter or

430
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:40,430
houmous and fulvic acid is defined as

431
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:43,309
the acid soluble fraction okay so these

432
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:46,070
can be separated by alkyl and extraction

433
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:50,389
and acidification and so you have the

434
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:52,669
humic is black and and gray dates in two

435
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:57,230
different shades of brown and then

436
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:59,240
fulvic oh you still there you broke up

437
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,140
for a second there so you said the the

438
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,980
humic acid is black yeah it's black or

439
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,820
brown it can gradate from brown and the

440
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,610
full the gas

441
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:13,490
it is go over yellow but here's the

442
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:16,909
story on that it's about molecular

443
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:20,870
weight the low molecular weight is the

444
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:23,660
yellow stuff the gold the fulvic

445
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:26,269
so-called fulvic acid acid soluble that

446
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,300
has got a low molecular weight okay so

447
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:31,369
that can be absorbed by plant roots that

448
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:34,250
can be absorbed by cells it can be

449
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:38,750
absorbed on a foliar application the

450
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:42,500
black stuff can't it's a high molecular

451
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:46,309
weight and so plants can't directly

452
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,859
utilize that and in fact it's got a

453
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:51,649
colloidal structure and if you put it on

454
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:54,859
too heavy it tends to plug the roots up

455
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:58,370
it globs on to the root system and kind

456
00:22:54,859 --> 00:23:02,869
of plugs it up and you can get negative

457
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:04,279
effects so only the golden fulvic

458
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:08,899
fraction is actually going to be

459
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:12,379
absorbed by a cell and it really is a

460
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,210
cellular phenomenon so the black stuff

461
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,190
can be utilized by soil microorganisms

462
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,090
and fungi and it does have effect on

463
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,279
matter of fact the last paper I

464
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:25,939
published which was last year in Japan

465
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:27,710
at the iMix substance Society was the

466
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,920
effect of these products on soil

467
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:33,230
structure and Bach bacterial versus

468
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,420
fungal dominance so you can take a

469
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,240
burned-out soil like we have here in the

470
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:41,450
laminate Valley it's been over farmed

471
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:44,420
hardest cement or turns into muck clay

472
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,519
you know and when it's wet and my

473
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,610
experiments applying a humic and fulvic

474
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,369
acid to the soil in pots and in

475
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:54,879
greenhouse incubating it for different

476
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:57,649
periods of time and then looking at

477
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,920
sending it to local labs here that do

478
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:04,340
fungal you know do do soil food web

479
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,400
analysis so what we found in there is

480
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:10,720
that the controls went were totally

481
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:14,660
bacterial dominant and you know hard

482
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,089
pretty much unproductive and when we use

483
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,730
treatment so the humic substances and

484
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:21,388
then in 60 days different intervals

485
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:25,019
testing you see

486
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:28,378
that it reversed everything so the soil

487
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:31,618
went from bacterial dominant to to more

488
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:34,648
fungal dominance and that's really what

489
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:38,519
you're looking for so is that because of

490
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:40,618
the additional carbon and the chelation

491
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:44,548
that you're getting with the humic acid

492
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:47,939
molecules well that's part of it it's

493
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:49,888
actually way more complex than that you

494
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,419
know there's a certain amino acid for

495
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:54,328
instance another thing that we've

496
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,609
noticed is that and farmers would would

497
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:59,009
report this over and over and over is

498
00:24:56,608 --> 00:25:00,989
once we use the humic acid products on

499
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:04,019
the soil they start to see earthworm

500
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:05,940
activity they hadn't seen in years

501
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,399
you see castings on the surface they'd

502
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,588
see earthworms when they plowed you know

503
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,988
and that impressed them okay so what is

504
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:16,440
it that's causing it so a small amount

505
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:19,469
of humic substances per acre it's almost

506
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,249
nothing two or three hundred pounds of a

507
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:22,078
a cur

508
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:23,999
with our newest products of course

509
00:25:22,078 --> 00:25:26,190
they're activated concentrated and

510
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:27,989
they're effective it you know thirty

511
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:32,399
pounds I think or even ten pounds I

512
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:35,278
think but it has substances like certain

513
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:38,458
amino acids like TOC which are a

514
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:41,308
requirement for earthworms and it's got

515
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:45,479
a fair amount of complex biochemistry

516
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:47,219
that isn't totally defined okay but

517
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:53,489
there are these are requirements for

518
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:55,859
fungal fungal propagation and and so

519
00:25:53,489 --> 00:25:57,509
forth in other words humic acids are

520
00:25:55,858 --> 00:26:02,598
even effective at increasing mushroom

521
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:02,598
growth you know mushroom media you know

522
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:08,298
I'm not sure we're really there you know

523
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:14,959
but it's it's it's you know it's like we

524
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,639
didn't know what caused scurvy either

525
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:19,528
but they found out that lemon juice or

526
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:22,138
lime juice would prevent it but we

527
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:25,739
didn't know what vitamin C was at the

528
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:30,568
time so I see these humic substances as

529
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:33,509
the vitamin C scenario of modern times I

530
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:35,079
mean it's a requirement to prevent

531
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:39,009
diseases

532
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:40,898
and provide optimum growth and we know

533
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:42,849
it works just like they knew that if he

534
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:47,229
ate lime she wouldn't get scurvy but

535
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:49,089
they didn't know about vitamin C so they

536
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,079
are there are components in there that

537
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:56,138
we just have not we're not there yet

538
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:58,720
what the specific components are they do

539
00:26:56,138 --> 00:27:02,709
that but they're there it's a cellular

540
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,690
your thing it's essential for for

541
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,139
cellular life we know that on a broader

542
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:12,788
scale humic substances are protein

543
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:17,138
acceptors and protein donors so you know

544
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:18,759
at a higher level of cellular biology

545
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:23,428
they have the ability to increase

546
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:26,169
acceptance of electrons and protons

547
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:32,528
that's been published research pretty

548
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:36,788
recent so it has a very basic effect on

549
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:41,138
some very basic properties in nature of

550
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:44,470
life and it's hard to say it's cause the

551
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:48,689
chelation or this or that it's much more

552
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:51,519
complex than that it has to do with

553
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,580
molecular genetics as it turns out I'm

554
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,378
jumping ahead 40 years now yeah let's

555
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:59,199
let's talk a little bit about that

556
00:27:56,378 --> 00:28:01,898
chelation benefit just because that is

557
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,869
something that is most widely known

558
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:06,518
about humic substances and for those of

559
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:08,589
you that may not be familiar with the

560
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:12,278
term chelation it's really just a fancy

561
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:15,878
word for bonds with essentially the

562
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,769
minerals in the soil and helps you can

563
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:21,189
expand on this helps make them more

564
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:23,679
plants available well it has a buffering

565
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:26,320
effect okay so if you make a nutrient

566
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,690
solution and you try to make a

567
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,099
concentrated nutrient solution you know

568
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,899
you're gonna have bonding you're gonna

569
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:33,959
have like phosphate tying up with

570
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:37,148
calcium or iron you're gonna have

571
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,850
nutrient interactions it's hard to keep

572
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:42,428
that those elements as individual

573
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:44,349
elements in solution you're gonna

574
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:47,320
they're going to react they're going to

575
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,519
combine you know into an insoluble

576
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,490
precipitate

577
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:54,549
okay the humic substances prevent that

578
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:57,339
in other words that's sort of the

579
00:28:54,549 --> 00:29:00,549
chelation effect in other words so you

580
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:04,089
take zinc zinc by itself if you add to

581
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:06,579
the soil and of course it's crucial zinc

582
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:10,720
they can tie up with iron you can tie up

583
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:13,960
with manganese you can you know excess

584
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,089
phosphate can tie up zinc in the root

585
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,829
system and you get all those problems

586
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,889
now that's that's that's part of the

587
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:23,649
reason the agricultural decline because

588
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:26,380
it lacks buffering substances this is

589
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:31,450
what humic substances do so you take

590
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:33,850
zinc like zinc sulfate and you combine

591
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,269
that with the humic substance you have

592
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:40,569
something called zinc full-volume 8c so

593
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:45,308
you've created you you've put the zinc

594
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:48,819
in an organic form you know slash

595
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:52,299
chelation chelated form in other words

596
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:54,819
it's it's part of an organic complex and

597
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:57,190
now it's not going to combine with

598
00:29:54,819 --> 00:30:01,450
something else and this would allow you

599
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:04,019
to use lower concentrations of zinc

600
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,640
sulfate then for example oh absolutely

601
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:09,519
because otherwise you have to use a huge

602
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,259
amount because it ties up so fast yeah

603
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,910
and and so these elements are mostly in

604
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,129
the soil anyway but they're already

605
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:22,269
insoluble precipitate you've already

606
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:25,770
combined so use of humic substances on a

607
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:29,349
natural soil tends to reverse that so

608
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:32,289
for instance humic substances fulvic

609
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:35,199
acid are really big-time responsible for

610
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:37,000
phosphate availability in the soil and

611
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,269
as the organic matter is depleted the

612
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,269
humic acids complete it depleted

613
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:46,058
phosphate availability is reduced and so

614
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:48,609
the farmers respond by huge amounts of

615
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:53,319
phosphate because it's gonna get tied up

616
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:55,659
almost literally within days so you know

617
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:59,859
they're using high doses every year and

618
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:02,439
you can't tell them otherwise okay but

619
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:05,688
my and this is a big part of my work

620
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:07,429
and I know and in other places I'm

621
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:10,308
telling the farmers no wait a minute no

622
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:13,969
let's test the total phosphate levels in

623
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:16,158
your soil because this use of excess

624
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:18,588
phosphate is tying up zinc and now

625
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,719
you're having like reduced maturity

626
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:22,519
reduced growth because you're causing a

627
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:25,879
tie-up of zinc because of the excess

628
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,009
phosphate and when you flood your again

629
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:29,838
you're forming phosphite which is toxic

630
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:32,838
it's causing problems with the root

631
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:36,288
system okay so we'd actually test the

632
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:37,969
soil for total phosphates and because

633
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:40,068
high as 10,000 pounds an acre

634
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:43,038
I mean they've been putting putting it

635
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:45,168
on for so long you know but the soil

636
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,489
organic matter depleted to less than 2

637
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:50,119
percent so they weren't getting

638
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:53,088
availability and so you know we would

639
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:54,138
put humic acids on and do leaf analysis

640
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,019
and you're good

641
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:58,758
matter of fact in decades of me doing

642
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:00,949
this kind of work I've never seen a case

643
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:04,459
yet where the phosphate didn't come up

644
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:08,239
to optimum level without adding any

645
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:10,939
additional phosphate so it's a matter of

646
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:14,209
humic substances maintaining

647
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:17,329
availability this is particularly a

648
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:20,509
phosphate but also trace elements

649
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:23,418
well biological activity good diversity

650
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:25,399
and bioactivity help as well in dealing

651
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:28,699
with with remediation in situations like

652
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:30,888
that yeah because you know biological

653
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:32,899
activity is what's producing natural

654
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:34,938
humic substances in the soil to begin

655
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:38,448
with okay that makes sense

656
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:41,839
so when you use a human product it's

657
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:43,909
like priming the pump none other words

658
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:46,759
we put it on in the spring and the

659
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:49,189
organic matters 2% or less like 1.5

660
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:52,128
percent phosphate levels by the

661
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:55,639
availability scale would be 5 or 6 ppm

662
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:57,759
and then by fall after a human

663
00:32:55,638 --> 00:33:01,478
application the organic matter

664
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:04,699
inexplicably could come up 2 percent you

665
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:06,979
know so 4 percent you know three and a

666
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:09,318
half percent and the phosphate

667
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:11,568
availability would be good the entire

668
00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:15,259
growing season based on leaf analysis

669
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:15,869
petiole analysis so you had a very rapid

670
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,990
effect

671
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:21,689
but why how could it possibly increase

672
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,819
the organic matter that machi you're

673
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,470
talking about thousands of pounds per

674
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:28,740
acre of organic matter and you've only

675
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:33,390
used it the most let's say when we use

676
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:35,970
the raw stuff 200 pounds an acre it's

677
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,660
impossible okay but what's going on

678
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,700
there is you're stimulating root growth

679
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:45,750
you're stimulating fungal biomass

680
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:48,900
big-time so then you have a mic mycelial

681
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:52,890
mass for them in the surface okay and

682
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:55,050
then that becomes organic matter so so

683
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,900
that'll test as organic matter in other

684
00:33:55,049 --> 00:34:00,419
words you stimulated a lot of activity

685
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,750
and and the fungi can break down raw

686
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:05,730
organic matter like straw

687
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:10,648
roots and dead root systems you know

688
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:12,780
plant residues and and then that soil

689
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:16,409
test will show an increase in soil

690
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:19,679
organic matter but it took that priming

691
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:22,980
the pump with the humic substances to

692
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,500
kick off you know that activity and of

693
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,168
course I'd also advise them on different

694
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,909
tillage methods no we're not gonna plow

695
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:33,418
deep we're not gonna plow the good

696
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:35,490
organic matter deep in the cold soil you

697
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:38,069
know organic matter humans forms on the

698
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:39,869
surface that's where a fence post rots

699
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,720
right on the surface that's where the

700
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:45,659
activity is so we had to change tillage

701
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,138
methods tilling a surface you know

702
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,690
keeping the organic matter what we call

703
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:55,590
managing to decay systems so that we do

704
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,300
get humic substances so that's pretty

705
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:00,180
much what's going on you're stimulating

706
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,200
oh and of course we didn't have a soil

707
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:06,869
food web analysis then like we do now so

708
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:10,169
now we can look at these things and see

709
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:14,039
what's really going on and that's what's

710
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:16,530
going on the fungal biomass increases

711
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:19,529
and just forms a mycelial mat you know

712
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,900
within the whole soil and forms crumb

713
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:24,630
structure because you know it tends to

714
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:28,750
form a stable crumb structure because of

715
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:32,170
the mycelium activity and sort of forms

716
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,780
in the soil so you go from a slimy soil

717
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:37,360
that sticks together to one that it has

718
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,660
a crumb structure and part of that is

719
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,510
the colloidal effect of the humic acid

720
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:48,629
which tends to coat the soil particle

721
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:51,280
with it so it's a it's a living layer

722
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,920
between the dead mineral of the soil and

723
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,430
the living plant root so and it also

724
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,940
state causes formation of crumb

725
00:35:57,429 --> 00:36:03,699
structure and the soil so this this is

726
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:08,380
really crucial stuff I mean the humic

727
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:09,519
acids are humans in the soil is you know

728
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,360
the only difference between the earth

729
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,230
and the moon

730
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,610
okay now I studied soil formation when I

731
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,260
lived in Hawaii matter of fact I

732
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:21,280
developed all these products that I sell

733
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:25,000
now in Hawaii when I was working with a

734
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:29,560
range of industries in Hawaii because my

735
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,420
specialty was declined at that point in

736
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,000
my life you know I had worked as a

737
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,280
researcher okay why do we have macadamia

738
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,900
decline why do we have avocado decline

739
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,830
what's happening to the trees what's

740
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:46,030
going on with citrus why what's decline

741
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:50,319
systems why why do they orchards go the

742
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,850
other way so I looked at South formation

743
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,650
in Hawaii you can see everything from

744
00:36:51,849 --> 00:37:00,639
fresh lava that's 2,000 degrees to 150

745
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:05,710
foot tall rainforest depending on the

746
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:08,230
age of the lava flow so how can you get

747
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,010
six feet of soil of what they call

748
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:13,179
histah Sol's

749
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:19,180
or organic soils form over sterile lava

750
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:23,109
rock kind of important information well

751
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:25,929
it all starts with with with sterile

752
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:29,099
rock it's pretty highly mineralized

753
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:32,230
though and then you have you begin with

754
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:35,139
lichens that start to grow on that rock

755
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:39,880
and then you get higher plants like

756
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:41,150
grasses lichens break down and and

757
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,818
houmous again

758
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:47,559
it's all about humic substances or humic

759
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:53,150
acid formation it's a gradual process

760
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:57,170
and as a succession progresses you know

761
00:37:53,150 --> 00:38:00,108
from lichens to grasses to brush you

762
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,210
know and the soil layer gets deeper

763
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:04,548
thicker and then trees start to appear

764
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,949
and then they start dropping leaves and

765
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:09,199
bark and then you know then the soil

766
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:11,960
gets deeper and deeper you know and then

767
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:16,578
people come in cut down the rainforest

768
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:19,548
plant coffee or whatever macadamia or

769
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:25,130
whatever it is pineapple and then over

770
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:27,048
the years the soil just goes away it is

771
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,690
oxidized this now you're right down on

772
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:30,798
lava again basically the Hawaii and

773
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:35,528
Native Hawaiians

774
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:39,048
before Europeans knew how to handle this

775
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:42,019
they knew how to be sustainable on that

776
00:38:39,048 --> 00:38:44,659
in those conditions we didn't we were

777
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:47,480
just soil miners that came in and

778
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:50,239
wrecked it but bottom line is nature can

779
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:54,338
make you know deep very rich very

780
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:58,129
balanced soil starting with sterile lava

781
00:38:54,338 --> 00:39:01,880
and there's so what we're doing is we're

782
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:05,568
just speeding that process up by taking

783
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,329
mind mind materials yeah so that brings

784
00:39:05,568 --> 00:39:11,088
up a couple questions for me we because

785
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:12,589
houmous is caused by the the composting

786
00:39:11,088 --> 00:39:16,219
process or the breakdown of organic

787
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:19,940
matter if I had a compost pile and I

788
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:23,480
think every every gardener should and I

789
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:27,528
wanted to increase that decomposition

790
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:30,349
rate in terms of in terms of making my

791
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:33,139
own houmous you know that we'll have

792
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:38,028
that humic acid and fulvic acid fraction

793
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:41,558
should I be applying any of the humates

794
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:44,659
to my compost pile in addition I assume

795
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:46,670
things like aerated compost teas could

796
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:47,960
also help in increasing that biological

797
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,269
activity and helping speed up

798
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,250
decomposition it sounds like I should

799
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:54,800
use a lot of things that are high in

800
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,349
lignin for example you talked about

801
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,140
because that'll write it down into that

802
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:02,119
that humic acid fraction what what do

803
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:02,960
you recommend in terms of optimal

804
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:08,630
composting

805
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,760
well I've different compost achieving

806
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:14,450
that because we can go right back to

807
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,940
biodynamic compost preparations which

808
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:18,169
influenced me back in the 60s we didn't

809
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,679
know what they were but it was this

810
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:24,110
black powder you know and you added that

811
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,940
to your your raw materials and

812
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:31,789
composting yeah that's called the

813
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:34,849
biodynamic preparations what I have now

814
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:37,639
our product like full humic and all that

815
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:41,360
basically our modern biodynamic

816
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:44,839
preparations but you see if you compost

817
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,829
with deficient organic matter in other

818
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:51,410
words you're taking organic matter

819
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:55,039
whatever it may be straw or whatever it

820
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:58,670
is off of deficient soil well you're

821
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,529
gonna have deficient compost so I mean

822
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,450
you can't make a silk purse out of a

823
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:05,360
sow's ear that's what my grandfather

824
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:08,929
used to say it's pretty hard to find

825
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:12,620
like virgin materials to compost it

826
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:16,119
would have the right balance of trace

827
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:19,969
elements there's always a problem there

828
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:23,269
so we've done a lot of trials at em7 and

829
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:26,239
of course in compost tea we've done all

830
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:29,570
kinds of analysis and bike microbial

831
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:32,419
testing same thing you get the increase

832
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:37,670
in fungal biomass and then what are the

833
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:40,090
best things for compost well you know

834
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:44,300
it's kind of interesting what that is

835
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:46,340
municipal wastes in other words right

836
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,400
here in Oregon and in Washington you

837
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:51,260
know they're taking like leaf all the

838
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,990
stuff they they rake up in the city you

839
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:56,660
know all the leaves the fallen leaves

840
00:41:52,989 --> 00:42:01,159
all the wood waste and stuff and then

841
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:03,440
composting it and that's got lignans

842
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:07,730
tannins you know it's oak leaves it's

843
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,780
hardwood broadleaf leaves and bark and

844
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,990
twigs

845
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,870
that's your best stuff now now I do

846
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:17,079
agree with you that leafmold compost is

847
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:20,389
some of the best and I love collecting

848
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,250
leaves and also you know all their

849
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:26,480
softwood and a combination of softwood

850
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:29,809
and hardwood woodchips but our municipal

851
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,579
compost up here in Washington I found is

852
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:34,460
is really not all that good because it's

853
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:36,650
one processed very very quickly in uni

854
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,480
the couple runs and so it's it's a lot

855
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,450
of time not even finished it's still hot

856
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,550
that bacteria is highly dominant and

857
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:47,389
still creating a lot of thermal energy

858
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,760
and I don't know if my neighbor or

859
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:52,400
someone down the road used you know high

860
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,710
levels of herbicides or pesticides on

861
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,610
that leaf surface that may end up in my

862
00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:00,500
compost right exactly and that's true

863
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,840
that's very true the compost they sell

864
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:06,530
and there's we have a couple sources

865
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,480
here yeah it's hot it's not done it's

866
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,960
not finished I mean if you go back to

867
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,530
biodynamic theory you don't want to use

868
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,679
a compost until it's well rotted that's

869
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:21,080
the term they use well rotted okay now

870
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:24,829
it also you don't want to use a compost

871
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:28,029
until it's got critters in it okay so in

872
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:32,150
other words earthworms insects little

873
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:34,190
things crawling around right see so it

874
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:36,559
has to be you know go through its cycle

875
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,990
you know the heat and all that the act

876
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:43,159
any of my CDs and all these things and

877
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:44,929
then it goes into a fungal stage in

878
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:47,299
other words I actually grew up around

879
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:50,839
the mushroom industry in Pennsylvania

880
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:53,210
and I've been a mushroom grower so these

881
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,610
folks know more about composting than

882
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:58,849
anybody you know because you have to

883
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:02,180
push this compost through all these

884
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:07,400
stages to where it's a media for fungi

885
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:09,710
and that requires it's it's a lot more

886
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,289
elaborate than your municipal compost

887
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,490
for sure

888
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:16,489
and it takes time

889
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:22,129
in other words on the conventional or

890
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:25,879
let's say classic bio dynamics you might

891
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:30,349
the composting process might last two or

892
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:34,309
more years before the compost is cured

893
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:36,349
and that is contains you know little

894
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:38,450
critters running around and inside of it

895
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:41,028
I think that's a really important point

896
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:43,818
that you bring up static composting or

897
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:45,528
giving the compost time to really break

898
00:44:43,818 --> 00:44:49,250
down is something that's really lacking

899
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:51,048
in I'd say 90% of commercial composts

900
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,190
that are available so if you want to

901
00:44:51,048 --> 00:44:54,288
make your own you really have to

902
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,599
dedicate time to it just like you would

903
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:59,539
a fine wine or a whiskey or anything

904
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,450
like that absolutely and then you have

905
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:04,849
to keep aerating it because if you let

906
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:06,919
it go anaerobic there's toxins there

907
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:08,838
that roots will touch that and stop

908
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,588
growing if there's any clumps of

909
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:14,778
anaerobic stinky stuff I call it yeah

910
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:17,659
and then the compost should have that

911
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:21,380
good rich smell - not a rotten smell not

912
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:24,828
a soured on a septic but a rich houmous

913
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,869
any good Pennsylvania Dutch farmer knows

914
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:29,059
with what I mean okay

915
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:31,970
or any good farm really well I don't

916
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:34,490
know about that but yeah so these

917
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:36,739
municipal compost products they're just

918
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:40,278
the beginning stage I bring that stuff

919
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:43,189
in here i truckload and yeah and and

920
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:46,759
then I recom post it i reformulate it

921
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:49,568
pilot aerate it and you sit out here for

922
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:52,429
a year or two before i'm gonna use it

923
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:55,509
you know and i add other stuff to it

924
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:57,919
like calcium sources to balance the pH

925
00:45:55,509 --> 00:46:00,528
because that's crucial I mean in other

926
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,180
words for the get the right fungal

927
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:05,420
activity you gotta have calcium you

928
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:07,940
gotta have the pH reasonable the high

929
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:11,809
level so they can mushroom compost you

930
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:15,619
had a lot of gypsum lime let's say and

931
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:21,700
other substances to it because we're

932
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:24,890
really trying to grow fine JA here and

933
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:26,960
so there are negative like for instance

934
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:30,739
a lot of compost and potting soils they

935
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,340
use bark fir bark okay this is a problem

936
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:36,769
like if you use more than ten percent

937
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,960
fir bark in something there are negative

938
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:41,989
effects okay this is because of the

939
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,740
breakdown of that bark dust and it forms

940
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:48,069
phenolic compounds and other substances

941
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:50,329
that are negative to growth and

942
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:55,130
microbial in other words it's sort of

943
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:56,869
like disinfectant and then there's all

944
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,990
kinds of breakdown products that are

945
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:03,639
negative 2 root growth of plant growth

946
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:06,459
so you know bark I'm talking about

947
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:10,009
softly you know pine fir and all that is

948
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:14,630
negative more negative than let's say

949
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:18,530
oak but bottom line is it needs to be

950
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:20,570
all broken down and cured and you'll

951
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:21,170
start to see fungal activity in the

952
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:25,090
compost

953
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:28,070
you know you'll notice fungal activity

954
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:30,350
especially under a microscope now you

955
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,170
have a stable compost and the ammonia

956
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:35,329
levels are gone they've they've the

957
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:39,650
microbial activity that is converted the

958
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:41,569
ammonia to microbial protein and then

959
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:47,059
the fungi actually it's a pretty complex

960
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:51,380
thing composting right but you can cause

961
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:55,309
yourself a lot of problems using what

962
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:57,829
they call compost which is really really

963
00:47:55,309 --> 00:48:01,009
kind of isn't yeah we talked about it on

964
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:03,769
another episode that I did the idea that

965
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:07,340
a lot these potting soils have fir bark

966
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:10,159
but it's also known as forest houmous or

967
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,800
it has it has a bunch of names that make

968
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,359
it sound like it's an beneficial

969
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,760
ingredient but you already discussed

970
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,980
some of the detrimental effects that and

971
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,780
potential it can have in all right

972
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,730
products I mean they use they use bark

973
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:26,960
because they have it it's cheating they

974
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:29,300
have a lot of it yeah cheap but it but

975
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,550
and they use a lot more than 10% we know

976
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,830
that more than 10% is a problem I mean

977
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:36,350
there's there's people out here using

978
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:38,989
you know 40 50 percent I mean I see it

979
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:40,969
all the time I would never use a bark

980
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:43,849
fir bark in any of my pot I make my own

981
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:47,119
potting mix you know and it's pretty

982
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:47,929
much I'm gonna start doing it

983
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,818
commercially

984
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:51,858
it's gonna be sort of a real premier

985
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:56,949
brand you know it's just gonna be sold

986
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:59,538
locally but it's quite sophisticated and

987
00:48:56,949 --> 00:49:03,169
we've been doing a lot of testing here

988
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:05,260
with it and it's basically re composted

989
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:07,760
municipal compost we either get from

990
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,980
McMinnville or south of here by

991
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,130
Corvallis whether it's a big composting

992
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:16,608
operation so weary compost it and we can

993
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:20,349
we we amend it and then we combine like

994
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:23,838
humic substances at a pretty high level

995
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:26,778
and then and then actually we use steel

996
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:30,019
slag which is a high source of calcium

997
00:49:26,778 --> 00:49:33,199
and alyssa Cassatt and trace elements

998
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:37,489
and it's also super cheap so you're

999
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:39,710
talking about you know people are

1000
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:41,239
spending too much for come for some of

1001
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,369
these potting mixes and they're really

1002
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:47,259
inferior I mean I've done a lot of tests

1003
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:50,960
come growth tests comparing my simple

1004
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,000
you know mix it's all local stuff versus

1005
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,510
some expensive potting mixes which I

1006
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,949
won't mention the brand names and you

1007
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:04,520
know I can get about double the growth

1008
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:05,929
out of it out of my mix so yeah there's

1009
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:09,038
a lot of people wasting a lot of money

1010
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:11,659
on some of these potting mixes big time

1011
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:17,329
of course if you take a look at what

1012
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:20,389
we're doing here you'd be a believer but

1013
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:22,789
yeah it just goes back to real simple

1014
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:25,179
biodynamic concepts in good old organic

1015
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:28,309
farming and gardening magazine you know

1016
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:29,808
it's just good basic stuff that you know

1017
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:31,430
that farmers have been doing for

1018
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:35,510
hundreds of years probably thousands of

1019
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:37,759
years see so it's not like we don't have

1020
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:39,440
a you know a model you know that we

1021
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,140
don't know what's sustainable

1022
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,059
I mean I've studied sustainable and

1023
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:47,239
that's part of my PhD thesis by the way

1024
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:49,609
his studying sustainability in other

1025
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:51,259
words which cultures were sustainable in

1026
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:51,969
terms of agriculture and how did they do

1027
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,140
it

1028
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:57,019
and I always thought people would read

1029
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:59,298
really interested in this and I've given

1030
00:50:57,019 --> 00:51:01,789
papers on the subject like one of them

1031
00:50:59,298 --> 00:51:06,380
was called ancient Hawaiian Agricole

1032
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:09,199
as a model for sustainability there's

1033
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,630
some real meat in that but very very few

1034
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,789
people were interested in that because

1035
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,190
it seems like ancient history like no no

1036
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:19,519
no you know that's all that's all hat

1037
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:22,400
you know we're up to date we're mod and

1038
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,230
we're scientific you know and so you

1039
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,300
start talking about ancient agriculture

1040
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:29,240
as a model for sustainability they've

1041
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,860
got you know you get a lot of well

1042
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:33,169
there's just not a lot of interest in

1043
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:35,599
that concept but here's the here's the

1044
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:39,170
bottom line on that these folks for

1045
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,779
farming for thousands of years we've

1046
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:46,309
been farming for maybe while here in

1047
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:49,070
Oregon 150 the u.s. maybe 200 250 let's

1048
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:50,809
say but the Native Americans that were

1049
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:53,890
here before us including here in the

1050
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:58,219
Willamette Valley we're farming for

1051
00:51:53,889 --> 00:52:01,819
thousands of years sustainably not

1052
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:04,039
necessarily farming either they managed

1053
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,600
an ecosystem for instance the Indians

1054
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:08,119
here the Native Americans here in the

1055
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,179
Willamette Valley they were managing an

1056
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:12,619
ecosystem they didn't actually for him

1057
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:14,869
but they were very effective and what

1058
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:17,569
they were doing now the Hawaiians

1059
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:19,339
actually farmed and so did the Mayans

1060
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,830
and I've been in Belize I've studied

1061
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,890
I've been with the Mayan Indians I know

1062
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:27,130
what they do I've been in Egypt I've

1063
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:29,569
been in all over the place

1064
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,880
studying you know ancient agricultural

1065
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:35,210
techniques because they did it without

1066
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,670
chemical inputs and they did it for long

1067
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:40,690
periods of time and we talk about

1068
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:43,010
sustainability you know that's the goal

1069
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,349
sustainability sustainable agriculture

1070
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,570
blah blah blah how many years does it

1071
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:48,920
have to be sustainable to be sustainable

1072
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,760
I mean how many years are we talking

1073
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,210
about

1074
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,130
to qualify for sustainable you know

1075
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,440
because we happen to know that there

1076
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:00,200
were cultures that did farm sustainably

1077
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,119
for thousands of years and we're only

1078
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:04,939
you know we were only here maybe it's

1079
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:06,710
the most 200 well I think we are seeing

1080
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,320
this now I mean there's a big movement

1081
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:11,480
now around Korean natural farming the

1082
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,230
one straw revolution by Fukuoka has

1083
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,469
become really a pillar

1084
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:19,490
I met him I met him in Santa Cruz hit a

1085
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:22,828
conference really oh yeah I was highly

1086
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:25,259
influenced by him I set up raised beds I

1087
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:27,359
tried all his techniques a mixing CD

1088
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,210
pelleting seed scattering it all

1089
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:34,068
together oh yeah you bet

1090
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:38,068
yeah he was one of my examples one of my

1091
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:39,989
studies was was what he was saying and I

1092
00:53:38,068 --> 00:53:42,750
did manage to meet him at a sustainable

1093
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:44,639
AG Santa Cruz that UC Santa Cruz one

1094
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:48,690
year in person

1095
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:51,659
so those quite a breakthrough but again

1096
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,170
he was you know people were skeptical of

1097
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:54,568
him

1098
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:58,619
you know the establishment in Japan and

1099
00:53:54,568 --> 00:54:00,179
yet he proved it he did it but so that's

1100
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:03,450
what we need to be looking at you know

1101
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:06,509
like real examples of sustainability not

1102
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:08,639
just like what we think based on the

1103
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:11,250
conditioning from the you know the agro

1104
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,019
chemical industry I mean they were

1105
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,838
saying oh you don't need compost you

1106
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:17,280
don't need manure you know I just use a

1107
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:20,909
chemical fertilizer you can grow one

1108
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:25,369
crop after another no problem yeah

1109
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:29,429
except soil turns to cement you know

1110
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:31,740
it's totally not sustainable absolutely

1111
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:36,419
not I mean I live around you know I see

1112
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:38,250
it daily where I live and boy it's a

1113
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:41,838
hard time to get these farmers to listen

1114
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:45,030
to you you always get something listen

1115
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:47,099
you know some that succeed

1116
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:49,470
but the rest don't even want to look at

1117
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:52,798
that you know because their worldview

1118
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:56,669
just they're just not there

1119
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:59,880
so you know we need to look more in

1120
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:01,740
organic technique well you know there's

1121
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,200
a demand right now I mean I just came

1122
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:07,308
back from a few more months or two ago

1123
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:12,598
to Salinas Valley right so all the big

1124
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:15,420
buyers like Costco Walmart all these big

1125
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:18,539
produce companies their customers are

1126
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:21,559
starting to demand organic so the the

1127
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:24,329
public about 86% of the buying public

1128
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,920
would prefer organic produce

1129
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:29,530
so we've we got that that is really

1130
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,650
coming on strong so now the big players

1131
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:36,490
that buy a lot of produce are starting

1132
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:38,710
to demand organic production from these

1133
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:41,229
big big growers like in Salinas

1134
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:44,409
you know that girl lettuce and spinach

1135
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:46,719
and grapes and you name it strawberries

1136
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:50,379
and all that so a lot of our products is

1137
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:52,000
being used down there right now and so

1138
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,950
we're seeing a big change I've been

1139
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,630
waiting for a long time for this believe

1140
00:55:53,949 --> 00:56:00,879
me a long time so we're seeing a shift

1141
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:03,119
towards organic even within the Canon

1142
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,940
well even within the cannabis industry

1143
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:11,559
but you know we have quite a quite a few

1144
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:14,230
people growing cannabis organically an

1145
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:16,780
outside Sun grown like the Oregon's Sun

1146
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:19,119
grown growers guild and people in

1147
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:23,650
Washington you know Eastern Washington

1148
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:25,750
and as far as I'm concerned the quality

1149
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:28,510
factors are there just like an organic

1150
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:33,730
produce in general flavor

1151
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:36,670
you know nutrient content all that so to

1152
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:39,849
me organic approach is just superior in

1153
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:42,670
so many ways it's not even funny

1154
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:44,559
so my thought would be that the four

1155
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:46,960
people that are growing organically and

1156
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,420
want to incorporate humic acids into

1157
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,900
their into their application schedule

1158
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:56,500
with cannabis applying humates

1159
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:59,440
or humic and fulvic acids to the soil

1160
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:02,108
would be a way of helping increase I

1161
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,700
assume terpene production by helping

1162
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:07,869
make some of these trace minerals more

1163
00:57:03,699 --> 00:57:11,169
plants available yeah and more and more

1164
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:13,798
than that because the way these humic

1165
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:16,530
substances work for as the fulvic acid

1166
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:19,568
this really gets interesting

1167
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:24,069
it has to do with transcript profiling

1168
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:26,108
and the expression of genetic expression

1169
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:28,690
in other words there are specific

1170
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:32,380
components within the lignans tan and

1171
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:34,358
poly phenyl groups that switch on

1172
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,579
genetic pathways now this is something

1173
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:39,369
we've only known in the last couple

1174
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:40,740
years two or three years from German

1175
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:43,200
researchers at Humboldt you

1176
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:45,689
versity in berlin that I work with they

1177
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,059
have tested my products in fact we've

1178
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:50,250
tested our products in the aeroponic and

1179
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:53,789
hydroponic labs at Humboldt University

1180
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:56,849
of Berlin Germany and the results are

1181
00:57:53,789 --> 00:58:00,329
just short of spectacular but

1182
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:01,980
additionally they found out that how

1183
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:04,559
these products are working it's such

1184
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:07,019
minut amount is that they're actually

1185
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,289
tripping genetic pathways and they know

1186
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:12,469
which genes are being tripped and these

1187
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:16,949
are pathways for growth regulators

1188
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:19,159
resistance pathways other pathways like

1189
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:23,250
insulin like pathways on and on and on

1190
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:26,519
so this is a motive act action that we

1191
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:28,190
never had a clue because we don't even

1192
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:32,250
have the science of molecular genetics

1193
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:34,349
we didn't know about substances that

1194
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:37,230
turn on switch on resistance and all

1195
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:41,190
that so this is the kind of stuff that's

1196
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:43,650
going on really I mean it's it's on a

1197
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:52,200
cellular level you could determine it

1198
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:54,660
with a single cell and so you need a

1199
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:56,309
stable form of humans to do this in

1200
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:59,039
other words we're back to that business

1201
00:58:56,309 --> 00:59:03,150
of a long term composting and curing of

1202
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:06,329
the compost so that these precursor

1203
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:09,050
compounds like lignans can go through

1204
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:14,659
the you know the changes you know to

1205
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:17,550
polyphenols specific town and specific

1206
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:21,929
known components that affect genetic

1207
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:24,450
expression this is new stuff big-time

1208
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:29,579
big-time new stuff is not being done in

1209
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:34,529
the US so if I was a cannabis grower and

1210
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:36,179
I wanted to use fulvic acid in my you

1211
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,890
know in my regimen how would I apply

1212
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:40,199
that would I apply it in conjunction

1213
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:44,358
with things like the seaweed extract

1214
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:47,368
powder or on sulfur blackstrap molasses

1215
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:49,409
or with other higher nutrient content

1216
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:51,690
things like bat guano's that are soluble

1217
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:53,500
or is it best applied by itself and

1218
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:55,690
those having those ingredients or

1219
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,599
nutrients already in the soil well yeah

1220
00:59:55,690 --> 01:00:01,389
it's best to start with a soil that has

1221
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,750
the basic nutrients in the basic right

1222
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:08,349
mouths because humic substances

1223
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:10,690
provide nutrients they provide in crease

1224
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:13,659
uptake nutrients because they stimulate

1225
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:15,490
root growth they make the cell membrane

1226
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:18,279
more permeable so the plant can absorb

1227
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:21,250
more nutrients and they have effect

1228
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:25,180
chelation of phosphate but you know is

1229
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:27,489
it doesn't supply nutrients so to get

1230
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:29,829
the optimum results and believe me the

1231
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:32,379
optimum results can be enormous more

1232
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:33,090
than most people imagine especially with

1233
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:36,670
cannabis

1234
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:39,730
you've got to have the nutrient pack get

1235
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:42,010
your present see and then the humic

1236
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:45,030
substances just stimulate the uptake and

1237
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:48,250
in the cellular metabolism the protein

1238
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:53,380
proton donor acceptor concept and all

1239
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:56,650
these cell division is increased the

1240
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:59,200
mitochondria are our power energized you

1241
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:02,079
might say so you really gotta think

1242
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:04,899
cells its cellular it's a cellular thing

1243
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,299
okay so what's molasses gonna do well

1244
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:10,180
that's just gonna turn into alcohol or

1245
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:12,430
an organic acid you know in the soil

1246
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:15,279
itself I mean it's just like you take

1247
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:16,750
some grapes and juice them and just let

1248
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,250
it sit out well it's going to turn into

1249
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:22,570
wine because yeast are present and

1250
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:25,090
they're gonna take that sugar and

1251
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:26,640
they're gonna convert it to alcohol or

1252
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:29,470
they're gonna convert it to vinegar

1253
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:32,650
depending on what microorganism you're

1254
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:34,569
involved with so you know things like

1255
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:37,329
molasses and all can provide a little

1256
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:40,660
bit of trace elements and it can provide

1257
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:42,880
energy for for microbes but it's not

1258
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:44,710
really gonna do much for a plant well

1259
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,920
wouldn't that increase in biological

1260
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:50,079
activity in turn increase your nutrient

1261
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,760
cycling because I found on sulfur

1262
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,069
blackstrap molasses to be one of the

1263
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,570
best food sources our balanced food

1264
01:01:54,070 --> 01:02:02,590
sources for you know bacteria archaea

1265
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:06,039
fungal hyphae well we know sugar sugar

1266
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:07,210
is an energy source short for for

1267
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:09,429
something footage

1268
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:12,670
a matter of who who's an energy source

1269
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:14,829
for lay friendships for fungi a better

1270
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:18,070
energy source for fungi like we use in

1271
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:21,789
the mushroom industry is oil vegetable

1272
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:26,490
oil that's the energy source see for

1273
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:29,858
fungal biomass not sugars sugars can go

1274
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:31,959
you know like I say it most of the time

1275
01:02:29,858 --> 01:02:35,289
it's gonna be yeast that's gonna utilize

1276
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,960
the sugars and and fast pretty rapidly

1277
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:40,150
yeah but then the yeast is producing B

1278
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:43,170
vitamins and that could stimulate funds

1279
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:46,059
fungal biomass it's very complicated but

1280
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:48,039
like in a hydroponic media you don't

1281
01:02:46,059 --> 01:02:50,710
need it you absolutely don't need it

1282
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:52,960
like a lot of our work was done with

1283
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:55,720
aeroponics where you just have the roots

1284
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,240
it's hanging down there and a mist and

1285
01:02:55,719 --> 01:03:01,179
then we could just you know add the

1286
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:04,479
basic nutrients as per hydroponics you

1287
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:07,480
know your NPK your face element as a

1288
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:11,019
control and then we'd be adding like tm7

1289
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:14,349
SCYTL plus which has got kelp or the

1290
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:17,108
straight fulvic acid and then then

1291
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:20,730
determine the results statistically so

1292
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:25,480
where are we getting our best results

1293
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:27,929
just the fulvic acid because that's the

1294
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:31,719
low molecular weight that's the only

1295
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:33,608
fraction or part of humic substances or

1296
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:36,939
gaming acid you can actually be absorbed

1297
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:41,348
by the plant root so anything else can

1298
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:43,480
be negative so humic substances which

1299
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:48,280
are the black stuff and aeroponics or

1300
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:52,539
hydroponics if used excessively can

1301
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:56,200
reduce plant growth so we know basically

1302
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:58,599
what works and what works is keeping the

1303
01:03:56,199 --> 01:04:02,199
levels of fulvic acid at about 15 parts

1304
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:05,710
per million or so so and that's all the

1305
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:08,980
time it's like from the time that first

1306
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:11,099
that seed germinates you know we use it

1307
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:14,469
for cloning too for root cloning is

1308
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:16,990
terrifically quick effect on root growth

1309
01:04:14,469 --> 01:04:19,209
but in fact the only substance in nature

1310
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:20,769
I mean natural organic they can

1311
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:23,650
stimulate root growth is

1312
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:27,489
click acid low-molecular-weight with the

1313
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:29,700
right you know chemistry in that now

1314
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:32,079
we're getting into variation between

1315
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:35,439
deposits this is very important

1316
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:38,380
information that you cannot generalize

1317
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,019
about humic acids or the deposits that

1318
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:43,510
they're used to formulate them we've

1319
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:46,840
done tests on eight different humic acid

1320
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:50,080
deposits in the US and it it's just

1321
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:52,150
amazing the differences I mean some of

1322
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,679
them will stimulate root growth but not

1323
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:55,599
shoot growth some of them will stimulate

1324
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:58,000
shoot growth but not root growth

1325
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,699
some of them do nothing some of them

1326
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,360
have a negative effect some of them or

1327
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:09,719
two of them to stimulate both root

1328
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:14,890
growth and growth so there is a gigantic

1329
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:18,549
difference in these products and that is

1330
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:21,400
really a big unknown why that was

1331
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:25,360
well we've determined now the reasons

1332
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,559
you know has pretty arcane pretty

1333
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,870
complex chemistry

1334
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:31,299
it's about functional groups like the

1335
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:33,579
Russians know which are the positive

1336
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,410
functional groups present and what are

1337
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:37,329
the negatives and then they score by

1338
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:38,889
subtracting the negative from the

1339
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:43,960
positives and they come up with a number

1340
01:05:38,889 --> 01:05:46,329
like 86% bioactive and those are the

1341
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:49,990
humates that are bioactive that are

1342
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:54,009
effective or they're characterized by

1343
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:55,659
high aroma sisty air obesity in other

1344
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:59,830
words have a high level of aromatic

1345
01:05:55,659 --> 01:06:05,529
groups and then specific carboxylic and

1346
01:05:59,829 --> 01:06:08,349
phenolic compounds so this is all new

1347
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:12,490
information to the humates aren't just

1348
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:15,369
humates you even even within a given

1349
01:06:12,489 --> 01:06:18,099
mine you go a little deeper or a little

1350
01:06:15,369 --> 01:06:20,259
bit off the deposit and the results can

1351
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:23,319
be you know you have a product it

1352
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:25,990
doesn't do anything so you that's why

1353
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,460
it's so important the brain you know who

1354
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:29,979
you're dealing with the brand that

1355
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,650
you're dealing with or or do your own

1356
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:34,539
testing and again we're still back to

1357
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:36,970
using corn sweet corn

1358
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:39,610
I mean I started 40 years ago with sweet

1359
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:42,039
corn and bottom lying all these new

1360
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:45,250
tests that we're doing with bio assays

1361
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:46,719
and trying to functional groups and

1362
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,340
trying to correlate them with shoot

1363
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,730
growth root growth and all that stuff

1364
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:54,130
still comes back to sweet corn you know

1365
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:58,150
the only way you can tell is by what a

1366
01:06:54,130 --> 01:07:01,840
plant actually does the we don't have we

1367
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:04,480
can we can kind of do very expensive and

1368
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:08,559
complex organic functional group

1369
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:11,320
analysis and and kind of you know narrow

1370
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:13,119
it down a little bit but it really comes

1371
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:16,600
down to it to to actually that simple

1372
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:19,750
plant test you know where I'd soak the

1373
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:22,420
seed and different concentrations of

1374
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:24,670
different products and you could tell

1375
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:28,720
right pretty quick you know what the

1376
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:30,220
root growth was because only like the

1377
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:33,549
only little stimulate root growth is

1378
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:36,369
folic acid like you wait if that doesn't

1379
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:38,470
happen you don't have it and in fact in

1380
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:42,190
our all our aeroponic and hydroponic

1381
01:07:38,469 --> 01:07:45,250
tests pure hydroponic pure arabic you

1382
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:49,269
only need the fulvic acid there wasn't

1383
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:51,730
any benefits from the tm7 from site open

1384
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:56,019
there was benefit oh yeah over the

1385
01:07:51,730 --> 01:08:00,039
control yeah big time okay but as far as

1386
01:07:56,019 --> 01:08:01,989
the best results you you pretty much got

1387
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:07,750
the results just from the gold stuff or

1388
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:12,789
the folic acid alone and nothing else

1389
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:17,829
was really good system it's a different

1390
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:19,569
system than hydroponics so the the in

1391
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:21,989
the soil the humic substances can

1392
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:25,120
actually degrade down to phobic

1393
01:08:21,989 --> 01:08:29,439
substances and that's what happens in

1394
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:33,460
composting over time the black stuff or

1395
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:36,129
the humic further degrades you know by

1396
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:39,279
fungal activity to lower molecular

1397
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:40,838
weight fulvic acid so that's really why

1398
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:44,290
it's so important you know the whole

1399
01:08:40,838 --> 01:08:47,798
idea of well rotted or aged or cured

1400
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:50,579
compost because there's your time factor

1401
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:53,260
that's what takes the time that

1402
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:56,260
downsizing of the molecule the molecular

1403
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:58,180
weight and and so you just add that

1404
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:01,298
basically our product is one to two

1405
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:05,140
hundred two hydroponics all the time you

1406
01:09:01,298 --> 01:09:07,298
keep it in there they want and through

1407
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:09,819
the whole see the whole process because

1408
01:09:07,298 --> 01:09:12,939
we know that that is absolutely

1409
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:16,779
requirement for normal cellular cellular

1410
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:19,559
activity and plant growth it has to be

1411
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:22,810
there all the time it's crucial it's

1412
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:26,020
it's the living bridge between the dead

1413
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:28,089
mineral and the living plant root you

1414
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:31,420
know because basically hydroponics is

1415
01:09:28,088 --> 01:09:34,390
using dead you know using salt chemical

1416
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:35,829
salts yeah most of our most of our

1417
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:38,410
growers are gonna be growing in soil

1418
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:40,869
hopefully is my goal because I think

1419
01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:42,399
it's a more sustainable option long-term

1420
01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:45,789
and we're really fortunate here in

1421
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:47,858
Washington to have good compost sources

1422
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:49,960
like the one that we use is a two to

1423
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:54,340
three year aged fish compost which I've

1424
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,960
been pretty happy with but before I

1425
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:58,180
forget one thing I wanted to go back and

1426
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:02,560
touch on oh well another thing I should

1427
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:04,390
have wrote this up vermicompost in all

1428
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,200
these trials we did with eight different

1429
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:09,520
humic substances one of the the the

1430
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:12,849
substances we use in these trials is

1431
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:16,000
vermicompost now you could see parallels

1432
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:19,810
there the vermicompost had the similar

1433
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,960
effects to the best humates so they

1434
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:25,300
personally for my own growing I have a

1435
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:27,789
vermicompost bed out here you know and I

1436
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:32,409
throw stuff in waste materials in there

1437
01:10:27,789 --> 01:10:35,109
and I had like on a crop this year I

1438
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:39,729
used that vermicompost that have been

1439
01:10:35,109 --> 01:10:41,529
out there for six or seven years you

1440
01:10:39,729 --> 01:10:45,069
know in the results we have are just

1441
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:46,750
fantastic so you you can make your own

1442
01:10:45,069 --> 01:10:48,789
humic substances you don't really need

1443
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:53,380
to to buy them from me

1444
01:10:48,789 --> 01:10:57,069
you know earthworms are definitely play

1445
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:59,020
a part in all this and vermicompost is

1446
01:10:57,069 --> 01:11:01,899
yeah

1447
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:03,310
that that's that's a crucial factor of

1448
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:05,229
course if you stimulate earthworm

1449
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:09,370
activity in the soil you're gonna get

1450
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:12,909
that anyway you're gonna get it so just

1451
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:14,979
like I mean the whole idea of earthworms

1452
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:18,639
I mean you can't you can't discount that

1453
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:21,069
how crucial that all is you know then

1454
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,010
and that's why I say once you see

1455
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:26,079
earthworms in the compost then it's

1456
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:29,199
ready to use it's funny that you

1457
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:31,539
mentioned that because worm castings is

1458
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:34,210
something they're vermicompost thing has

1459
01:11:31,539 --> 01:11:37,779
come up in pretty much every single one

1460
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:39,550
of my podcast episodes so far everyone

1461
01:11:37,779 --> 01:11:41,829
wants to talk about them because of all

1462
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:43,869
the benefits that they have I think

1463
01:11:41,829 --> 01:11:46,750
that's really important but one thing I

1464
01:11:43,869 --> 01:11:49,449
wanted to touch on with you before we go

1465
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:52,859
any further we talked a little you

1466
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:56,260
talked a little about compost teas and

1467
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:58,689
one of the things that I found so I did

1468
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:01,600
some experiments using humic acids and

1469
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:05,589
in compost teas where I had a control

1470
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:07,480
using compost and distilled water and

1471
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:11,680
then I added some of these humic

1472
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:13,899
substances I tried I tried your tm7

1473
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,850
and then I tried some of the products

1474
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:19,029
from Terra Vita if you're familiar with

1475
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:21,460
them they're SP 85 and they're L C 10

1476
01:12:19,029 --> 01:12:26,889
plus 7 which is sort of a liquid chelate

1477
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:30,819
version of the TM 7 and what I found was

1478
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:34,480
I had I had a tough top the control

1479
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:37,210
actually had higher microbial activity

1480
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:39,399
than the ones that I added the humic

1481
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:40,989
substances to and I don't know if you

1482
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:43,599
remembered but I was talking about this

1483
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:46,920
one said Kanak on in a presentation and

1484
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,970
you came out to me afterwards and said

1485
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,230
something along the lines of yeah that

1486
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:52,840
didn't really those results didn't

1487
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:55,959
really surprise me but now in this talk

1488
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:58,480
you're saying that the tm7 you found

1489
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:01,480
increases microbial activity and T's and

1490
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:04,089
I'm just curious what your what your

1491
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:07,359
thoughts are on it I guess well it's

1492
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:10,900
about concentrations in other words tm7

1493
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:12,969
in a solution is alkaline so it can have

1494
01:13:10,899 --> 01:13:16,000
as it stands you know

1495
01:13:12,969 --> 01:13:19,060
and in its format you get it and it's

1496
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,029
got a pH of over 10 C because it's an

1497
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:24,520
alkaline form of humic substances so

1498
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:27,759
that can affect you know an important

1499
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:32,219
factor in in that culture in other words

1500
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:34,900
the pH you're increasing the salts right

1501
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:36,698
people tend to overdo it these things

1502
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:39,579
are effective in other words we don't

1503
01:13:36,698 --> 01:13:42,009
recommend a solution any stronger than

1504
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:44,430
what's looks like iced tea okay so

1505
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:47,860
that's like one gram per gallon

1506
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:50,140
you see so so what it's not so much how

1507
01:13:47,859 --> 01:13:54,309
much you use but what the concentration

1508
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:58,840
is C so you're in the neighborhood of

1509
01:13:54,310 --> 01:14:01,930
about up to 3 grams per gallon and so

1510
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,659
you know it's not black it's not you

1511
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:08,530
know in other words these substances can

1512
01:14:04,659 --> 01:14:11,319
take things to two different way in

1513
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:14,170
other words a lot of the German work now

1514
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:17,880
on these humic substances is is has to

1515
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:21,489
do with well you know health benefits

1516
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:23,829
longevity effects and all that okay it

1517
01:14:21,488 --> 01:14:26,468
they use the term core basis okay so

1518
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:30,880
humic substances are a poison at one at

1519
01:14:26,469 --> 01:14:33,489
one level and a tonic in another that's

1520
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:37,680
the concept before mesas that the stress

1521
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:41,349
provided from a small amount of a poison

1522
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:43,750
stimulates a lot of things I so so don't

1523
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:46,539
disagree with you I just think that from

1524
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:48,399
my experience and then yeah you're gonna

1525
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:50,079
see a decrease in bacterial activity

1526
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:52,899
that's exactly what we showed in the

1527
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:55,899
tests I did last summer in the

1528
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:59,859
greenhouse with soils absolutely we

1529
01:14:55,899 --> 01:15:03,460
start out with the control and controls

1530
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:05,139
versus and in the bacterial levels drop

1531
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:07,779
way down and the fungal that will go

1532
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:09,160
away up so yeah I mean that's what

1533
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:14,229
you're looking for you want the

1534
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:16,869
bacterial activity to be reduced they're

1535
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:20,169
not reduced you just want to see fungal

1536
01:15:16,869 --> 01:15:22,300
activity is dominant because bacteria

1537
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:23,679
can't take apart cellulose or anything

1538
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,230
like that they don't really have much of

1539
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,859
a chelating effect or anything it's all

1540
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:29,049
about

1541
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:31,630
yeah and the metabolites produced by

1542
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:34,390
fungi and their ability to digest

1543
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:37,270
organic matter whereas bacteria don't

1544
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:39,880
can't they need the help of fungi first

1545
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:42,220
you know they can take sugars sure you

1546
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:46,350
know bacteria can directly utilize

1547
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:51,670
sugars fungi can produce sugars from

1548
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:54,640
carbohydrates from you know lignans and

1549
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:57,880
carbohydrates and just cellulose as far

1550
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:02,050
as that goes you know the right fungi

1551
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:04,329
can produce sugars from cellulose so you

1552
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:07,659
know yeah I mean you're gonna notice a

1553
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:10,630
decrease decrease in bacterial activity

1554
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:12,430
I guess I didn't see that increase in

1555
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:14,890
fungal activity though either at least

1556
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:17,380
in the t's themselves now I'm not

1557
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:20,020
suggesting that humic acids or human

1558
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:21,670
quemic products don't have a ton of

1559
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:24,040
benefits like you've said like you've

1560
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:26,710
already mentioned in this talk I've just

1561
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:28,810
found personally I've had better success

1562
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:32,619
applying them separate from my compost

1563
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:34,690
teas in well it could be there's a lot

1564
01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:37,840
of things that can be going on there you

1565
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:40,449
know it's kind of complex how that could

1566
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,220
go down you know depending on what raw

1567
01:16:40,449 --> 01:16:45,099
materials you're using just the whole

1568
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:48,820
range of things whole range of issues it

1569
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:50,950
just gets very complex and then really

1570
01:16:48,819 --> 01:16:53,289
and until you put that compost tea on

1571
01:16:50,949 --> 01:16:56,109
the soil and then a whole bunch of other

1572
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:58,720
things are going to happen once it's

1573
01:16:56,109 --> 01:17:01,029
added to the soil and and you know

1574
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,380
changes actually you know what you're

1575
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:04,929
talking about

1576
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:07,779
humic substances or organic matter and

1577
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:10,750
soil microbial activity that's the most

1578
01:17:07,779 --> 01:17:13,630
complex chemistry in nature it's

1579
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:16,300
extremely complex you know that in humic

1580
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:18,760
acid or so-called humic acid this is

1581
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:23,260
recent researchers just a paper

1582
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:27,310
published last fall using the four tier

1583
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:32,560
exchange electrospray you know some new

1584
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:34,990
technique of determining you know

1585
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:38,010
particular compounds in something okay

1586
01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:40,840
so there's over 800 different compounds

1587
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:43,600
identified within I mean

1588
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:46,060
let's say dots on the electrospray graph

1589
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,960
I mean we don't know which what their

1590
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,670
names are

1591
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,399
you know they fall within you know

1592
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:54,880
polyphenols and phenols and with you

1593
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:56,710
know carboxylic sand all that but you

1594
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:03,310
know there can be as actually as many as

1595
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:07,960
8,000 different compounds so it's

1596
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:09,310
extremely complex so you know when

1597
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,260
you're talking about a humidor fulvic

1598
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:13,150
acid you're not talking about a specific

1599
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:15,909
substance at all

1600
01:18:13,149 --> 01:18:19,960
you're talking about a fraction an

1601
01:18:15,909 --> 01:18:22,930
acidic fraction that may have several

1602
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,640
thousand different compounds you know

1603
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:26,890
because you know all the things that are

1604
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:30,910
claimed all the benefits for humic acid

1605
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:35,590
fulvic acid how can one compound do all

1606
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:37,389
that well it can't you know you have

1607
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:39,640
substances there that are key lehder you

1608
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:42,150
have some that are micro antimicrobial

1609
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:45,730
you have some that that did stimulate

1610
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:48,189
different genetic pathways we're just

1611
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:51,339
you know we're just at the beginnings of

1612
01:18:48,189 --> 01:18:53,169
this but we know there's thousands of in

1613
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:55,270
see what they used to for years I used

1614
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:58,359
to try to determine what is the formula

1615
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:00,130
the molecular diagram for humic acid or

1616
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:02,589
fulvic acid they spent years trying to

1617
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:05,140
figure that one out and now they're down

1618
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:09,039
to no no no no no it's it's that's not

1619
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:12,579
it it's it's actually a soup and it

1620
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:16,449
varies tremendously so there's thousands

1621
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:18,519
of individual compounds so to be able to

1622
01:19:16,449 --> 01:19:22,449
say that this thing did that or this

1623
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:25,690
thing did that I mean it's a level of

1624
01:19:22,449 --> 01:19:30,099
complexity that is just overwhelming

1625
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:34,149
you know that's why we stick to like in

1626
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:35,740
hydroponics just the fulvic acid because

1627
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:38,739
that's the low molecular weight that's

1628
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:41,349
absorbed by plants that's not going to

1629
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:44,590
interfere with anything else it's a key

1630
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:48,810
later in itself you start throwing humic

1631
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:48,810
acid in there the black stuff well

1632
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:54,659
that can combine with other things it

1633
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,380
can have an a that can have methylene

1634
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:57,599
groups

1635
01:19:55,380 --> 01:20:02,090
that's stuff that's associated with oil

1636
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:07,500
and coal methylene that's toxic okay and

1637
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:09,270
this varies so you know you you're not

1638
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:16,199
necessarily sure what's going on here

1639
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:18,210
see and so that's why I say okay the the

1640
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:20,909
part that has the bang the biggest bang

1641
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:23,609
for the buck is is the so-called phobic

1642
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:27,659
fraction which is our product called

1643
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:30,659
full power so and we have the first

1644
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:33,029
label on the west coast and here in

1645
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:35,550
Oregon they finally allowed us to call

1646
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:40,259
it folic acid because a new test method

1647
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:43,289
has been developed and approved by some

1648
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:45,539
different regulatory bodies and now

1649
01:20:43,289 --> 01:20:47,789
accepted by Oregon Department of Ag and

1650
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:50,460
you know hopefully the rest of the

1651
01:20:47,789 --> 01:20:52,920
states will follow suit so we can

1652
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,720
actually even define is only in the last

1653
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:58,619
year we could actually define fulvic

1654
01:20:54,720 --> 01:21:02,820
acid let alone all the goodies that it

1655
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:04,619
has in it so we're the only one that's

1656
01:21:02,819 --> 01:21:07,920
been able to do that actually get a

1657
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:10,800
label you know actually get through all

1658
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:15,140
the testing requirements you know heavy

1659
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:21,180
metals all the things that they require

1660
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:22,890
to register and as do with molecular

1661
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:24,810
weights and all that kind of stuff so

1662
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:27,420
when you start getting into something

1663
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:30,470
that has 8,000 as many as 8,000

1664
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:34,289
different compounds in it that vary

1665
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:37,760
tremendously it's hard to predict what's

1666
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:40,380
gonna happen exactly you know and then

1667
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:43,050
concentrations are crucial like I say

1668
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:45,690
it's toxic at one level and beneficial

1669
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:48,300
at another level well my hope is that

1670
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:50,519
people that listen to this podcast will

1671
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:52,079
take away that if they're growing in

1672
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,110
hydroponics they should just try the

1673
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,239
fulvic acid if they're using soil like

1674
01:21:55,109 --> 01:22:00,210
most of us are they can also incorporate

1675
01:21:57,239 --> 01:22:02,399
humid city mates and humic acids they

1676
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:04,779
can make their own by

1677
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:07,809
managing their own compost pile and

1678
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:09,359
taking care of their soil and hopefully

1679
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:11,980
realize that they need to try

1680
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:14,049
high-quality products and brands like

1681
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:15,669
yours for example they're not just

1682
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:17,760
sourcing these things on eBay because

1683
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:21,219
they're not going to contain the same

1684
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,079
constituents and properties and then

1685
01:22:21,219 --> 01:22:25,359
lastly that we're just really fortunate

1686
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:28,238
to be in an industry where there's so

1687
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:29,889
much left to learn and everyone should

1688
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:31,868
be doing their own trials and and

1689
01:22:29,889 --> 01:22:35,079
scientific method to find out what works

1690
01:22:31,868 --> 01:22:37,179
best for them with their soils so yeah I

1691
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:39,368
mean this isn't a guessing game you know

1692
01:22:37,179 --> 01:22:41,170
I see a lot of people try to grow that

1693
01:22:39,368 --> 01:22:42,759
way you know they all I think it needs a

1694
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:44,500
little amino acids today I think it

1695
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,679
needs all of this you know like what you

1696
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:50,408
think is meaningless

1697
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:53,380
you know it's what the plant wants it

1698
01:22:50,408 --> 01:22:55,149
counts you know and that's why you have

1699
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:57,100
to look at control you know okay let's

1700
01:22:55,149 --> 01:22:59,079
try this on the control versus a

1701
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:01,570
treatment see see what's really

1702
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:04,000
happening you know I mean all this fancy

1703
01:23:01,569 --> 01:23:05,948
science we've got now you know it's it's

1704
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,229
developing I mean we're not there yet

1705
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:10,029
okay but it still comes back to like

1706
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:11,529
getting some seeds and soaking them in

1707
01:23:10,029 --> 01:23:13,929
the stuff and seeing how quick they

1708
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:17,079
germinate I mean we did stuff here with

1709
01:23:13,929 --> 01:23:20,649
Oregon State University seed lab okay so

1710
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:22,600
where we just take fescue seed treated

1711
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:24,879
at different rates of fulvic acid and

1712
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:27,369
then and then then they they run it ok

1713
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:31,690
what's the speed of germination okay so

1714
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:34,059
it 1 to 1,000 dilution of full power we

1715
01:23:31,689 --> 01:23:36,849
get statistically significant increases

1716
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:40,960
in seed germination ok well that's

1717
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:42,969
definitive fulvic acid so I mean you can

1718
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,929
literally just soak some seeds in a one

1719
01:23:42,969 --> 01:23:48,189
to one hundred one to one thousand and

1720
01:23:45,929 --> 01:23:50,560
if you don't see any difference between

1721
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:53,769
the control and the treatment well then

1722
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:58,060
you don't have anything and and that can

1723
01:23:53,770 --> 01:24:01,570
be just take a week or so let's say so

1724
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:04,810
you know you let the plant tell you the

1725
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:07,118
plant needs to tell us we can't really

1726
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:10,420
tell the plant what it needs it tells us

1727
01:24:07,118 --> 01:24:14,339
what it needs you know and so reading

1728
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:17,109
the plant the color the bigger

1729
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:19,150
their root development like for instance

1730
01:24:17,109 --> 01:24:21,009
without using humic substances or fulvic

1731
01:24:19,149 --> 01:24:21,729
acid the root system is what I call

1732
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:24,909
stringy

1733
01:24:21,729 --> 01:24:28,149
it's a stringy root system that's the

1734
01:24:24,909 --> 01:24:31,199
morphology it's just stringy okay so and

1735
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:37,299
you use the folic acid real fulvic acid

1736
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:40,059
the morphology of the root is fibrous a

1737
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:43,360
lot of root hair development and it's

1738
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:46,330
dramatic okay so you can do your own

1739
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:48,339
trials and just you know wash the roots

1740
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:50,500
off you know use a potting mix it

1741
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:52,539
doesn't have humic substances you know

1742
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:56,140
like pro mix or something like that

1743
01:24:52,539 --> 01:24:58,539
something's inert pretty much and and

1744
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:00,369
you know you either gonna have it or

1745
01:24:58,539 --> 01:25:02,800
you're not I mean it's either gonna if

1746
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:07,029
you have a stringy root system well I'm

1747
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:09,550
sorry you know because the real thing is

1748
01:25:07,029 --> 01:25:13,869
going to give you a fibrous very very

1749
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:16,380
dramatically fibrous root system and

1750
01:25:13,869 --> 01:25:17,590
then of course the chute growth will be

1751
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:19,449
better

1752
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:21,430
most people just notice that they don't

1753
01:25:19,449 --> 01:25:25,359
really good but you need to wash the

1754
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:27,130
roots off take a look at that but you

1755
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:29,589
know that's that's still the bottom line

1756
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:34,000
on how to determine whether these things

1757
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:36,190
are effective or you can take it to the

1758
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,600
lab with that idea of the soil food web

1759
01:25:36,189 --> 01:25:42,759
analysis and take a look at that but

1760
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,800
when you add humic substances the black

1761
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,980
stuff you know well what we call full

1762
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,230
humic full humic is a soluble powder

1763
01:25:47,979 --> 01:25:54,039
that has the whole range it has the

1764
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:56,829
fulvic the humic avec Olmec all the

1765
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:59,439
various humic substances and minerals

1766
01:25:56,829 --> 01:26:01,180
nothing's been removed see these other

1767
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:04,119
products they'll just dissolve it an

1768
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:06,400
alkali and then settle it and then and

1769
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:10,840
then you know you get you just get this

1770
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:13,539
that one humic fraction but our product

1771
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:17,020
yep nothing has been removed okay

1772
01:26:13,539 --> 01:26:19,060
so it's the full spectrum okay so that's

1773
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:22,870
what the soil needs because the various

1774
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:25,900
microbes can utilize that they can you

1775
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:27,369
know start to break down organic matter

1776
01:26:25,899 --> 01:26:32,139
and form more

1777
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:33,550
substances forms a colloid that affects

1778
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:36,160
soil structure

1779
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:39,789
the biggest most important part of what

1780
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:44,739
humic does that's the black stuff is

1781
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:47,260
soil structure super-important it's the

1782
01:26:44,739 --> 01:26:49,960
difference between a brick and friable

1783
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:52,710
soil so I mean that's not an issue that

1784
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:57,010
it's an issue in hydroponics obviously

1785
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:59,470
so but it's crucial in any kind of other

1786
01:26:57,010 --> 01:27:02,289
you know growing activity in soils

1787
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:04,990
because once the structure is gone it's

1788
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:09,100
time to go to town and get a job you

1789
01:27:04,989 --> 01:27:12,849
know you've got cement limit valley is a

1790
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:17,950
good example of that but so these

1791
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:20,050
substances have a range of benefits you

1792
01:27:17,949 --> 01:27:22,119
know in soil structures in other words

1793
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:23,220
the first humeid I used was called clod

1794
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:26,289
buster

1795
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:30,280
soil softener supreme that's that's

1796
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:33,189
their logo soil softener supreme and we

1797
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:35,739
didn't know how it did that and now we

1798
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:39,129
saw our product called full humic s-- we

1799
01:27:35,739 --> 01:27:42,279
sell it to municipal use like sports

1800
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:44,350
turf like these football fields golf

1801
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:46,840
courses some of the big universities

1802
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:50,020
here use it on their you know football

1803
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:52,180
fields and and the guys are saying wow

1804
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:54,190
yeah the ground softer you know when we

1805
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:57,280
fall you know it's we're not bouncing

1806
01:27:54,189 --> 01:28:00,699
you know the ground this is softened and

1807
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:02,859
all that so you really want to think

1808
01:28:00,699 --> 01:28:05,590
about that you know is the the humic

1809
01:28:02,859 --> 01:28:08,739
feeds the soil the fulvic feeds the

1810
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:11,050
plant well I I really appreciate that

1811
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:13,269
and I want to thank you again for your

1812
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:14,949
time today I think we covered quite a

1813
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:17,770
bit and I'm hoping people will go out

1814
01:28:14,949 --> 01:28:20,079
and and try using some of these humic

1815
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:22,660
substances in their gardens and see what

1816
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:25,600
sort of effects they get well yeah I

1817
01:28:22,659 --> 01:28:29,550
mean it's it's almost a formula that

1818
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:32,350
that's gonna work every time you know

1819
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:34,900
assuming you know but the important part

1820
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:38,020
is to stick to the label and that more

1821
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:40,000
isn't better you know I mean that's the

1822
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:41,230
problem farmers may have you know they

1823
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,590
see a result and they

1824
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:48,488
more is better not in this case more

1825
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:50,980
ain't better there there is a curve

1826
01:28:48,488 --> 01:28:54,519
we've developed that curve we know what

1827
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:58,059
rates what concentrations will get us

1828
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:59,770
you know to where we want to be and then

1829
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:02,289
we know that it'll reach a point where

1830
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:04,540
you don't get any more benefit and it

1831
01:29:02,289 --> 01:29:06,159
plateaus off and then you use more and

1832
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:09,300
more and more it starts to go on the

1833
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:13,359
other way so you know it's almost

1834
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:15,820
homeopathic yeah because you're talking

1835
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:18,819
about things that affect cellular you

1836
01:29:15,819 --> 01:29:21,569
know response molecular genetics does

1837
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:25,329
not require you know more is not better

1838
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:26,799
it's not like like adding nitrogen or

1839
01:29:25,329 --> 01:29:29,680
something where you just get more and

1840
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,690
more growth you know and I learned from

1841
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:33,130
Jamaicans I also studied in Jamaica

1842
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:37,449
because there is a pretty good example

1843
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:40,300
of sustainable AG some of those folks in

1844
01:29:37,449 --> 01:29:43,389
the cockpit country that real Rasta

1845
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:45,310
people they're very you know they're

1846
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:48,940
they're particularly effective but they

1847
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:51,340
consider on cannabis okay on ganja they

1848
01:29:48,939 --> 01:29:54,329
consider chemical fertilizer okay this

1849
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:58,539
is this is a quote makes the plant mad

1850
01:29:54,329 --> 01:30:01,238
see so you ask them what's the best you

1851
01:29:58,539 --> 01:30:04,090
got what's the best stuff you got coach

1852
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:07,889
[ __ ] that's actually a term for

1853
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:10,869
high-grade cannabis in Jamaica goat [ __ ]

1854
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:14,850
because the highest quality cannabis is

1855
01:30:10,869 --> 01:30:17,430
grown using goat manure or or bat ratbat

1856
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:20,140
you know bat guano

1857
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:24,010
now use chemical fertilizer it makes the

1858
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:25,900
plant mad which they mean it makes it

1859
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:29,880
you know a lot of top growth I mean

1860
01:30:25,899 --> 01:30:33,519
vigorous you know male energy right and

1861
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:35,079
so you just get a leggy tall plant but

1862
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:39,220
it doesn't give you what you're trying

1863
01:30:35,079 --> 01:30:40,659
to get you know so that's learning from

1864
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:44,680
people that have been doing this for

1865
01:30:40,659 --> 01:30:46,899
quite a few years and that's something

1866
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:50,590
to think about you know if you're

1867
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:53,469
considering using chemical fertilizer it

1868
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:55,590
just makes the plant mad you know and

1869
01:30:53,469 --> 01:30:59,649
you want to use

1870
01:30:55,590 --> 01:31:02,770
organic methods you know plants only

1871
01:30:59,649 --> 01:31:05,259
need a little bite everyday you know

1872
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:06,940
it's two uses some of these hydro

1873
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:09,730
formulas and some of this stuff people

1874
01:31:06,939 --> 01:31:11,710
are doing with commercial fertilizers is

1875
01:31:09,729 --> 01:31:14,468
like feeding a man all he can eat on

1876
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:15,789
Sunday and then then then then he

1877
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:19,390
doesn't get anything to eat till next

1878
01:31:15,789 --> 01:31:22,289
Sunday when it was really they just need

1879
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:25,630
a little bite every day that's the key

1880
01:31:22,289 --> 01:31:31,119
that was dr. Robert Foster bio egg their
