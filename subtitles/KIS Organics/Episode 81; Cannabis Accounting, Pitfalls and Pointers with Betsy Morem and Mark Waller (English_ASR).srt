our gardens

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,878

41
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:33,519
now uh i heard about you guys because

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,719
i heard mark talking on clubhouse about

43
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,399
a particular form

44
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,759
that we'll talk about here in a little

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,759
bit

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,959
but accounting is something that is is

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,478
not

48
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,759
not you know something that we normally

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,759
talk about when we're talking about

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
cultivation but i wanted to cover this

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,879
because i think it's something that we

52
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,359
all have to be aware of it's just the

53
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,239
reality of growing in a legal market

54
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,840
and uh so i wanted to have you guys on

55
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,959
to talk a little bit about

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,079
what you do and how uh you know

57
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,559
accounting fits in um and the finances

58
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,639

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,759

who's with us

68
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,159
here today obviously and uh our our

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
biggest thing that we do is really

70
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,318
provide

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,360
world-class accounting services for

72
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,839
cannabis businesses from month end

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
annual compliance all the way down to

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,878
your your

75
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,800
audits that you have to think about and

76
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,159
we really try to use kind of a data

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,959
driven tech forward approach so one of

78
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,680
the things that's

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,159
unique about cannabis with regard to

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
other

81
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,840
businesses is that cannabis

82
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,560
businesses don't have as many tools in

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,000
the toolbox

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,319
that most businesses do they're very

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,280
stringent on what they're even allowed

86
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,439
to do at all

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,479
with banking there is there are many

88
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,120
regulations for

89
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,518
banks that say you can't work with

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,280
cannabis due to it being a federally

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,560
illegal substance on on schedule one

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,959
of the the federal government's schedule

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,239
of

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,239
of drugs and because of that there

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,719
are there are some banks that do work

96
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
with with cannabis businesses for sure

97
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,080
but there are not very many

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
and even the ones that do work with

99
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,360
cannabis businesses

100
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:34,639
are fairly well regulated so

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,720
it's almost uh it's it's almost like uh

102
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,759
searching for something that you aren't

103
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,878
quite sure to find

104
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,120
that normally any business can go

105
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,959
down to the corner and and find a bank

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,239
and and most banks are happy to pick up

107
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,080
new businesses it's

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,360
it's much trickier for for cannabis

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840
businesses so

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
we we really try to be kind of a partner

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,239
with cannabis businesses knowing

112
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,839
knowing what we know about partnering

113
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,239
with other banks

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,878
uh making sure that they have banking

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
services

116
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,679
and then providing end-to-end accounting

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,680
services so that

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,159
uh all of the different things that

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,040
become very complex especially for

120
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,079
cannabis growers we try to we try to cut

121
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,920
down that

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,920
that red tape as much as possible

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,679
thank you today yeah betsy do you need a

124
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,800
little bit of your quick background here

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
and then we'll dive in with some i've

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,319
got some questions for you guys

127
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,439
yeah absolutely um my name is betsy

128
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,879
moram and i'm a cpa as well

129
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,918
co-founder of morgan waller cpas um i

130
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,719
got into

131
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,198
i became interested in the cannabis

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,639
space a couple years ago

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,000
but but didn't really get into the

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,478
accounting side of things

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
until last year but i have been

136
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,199
providing

137
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,360
accounting services for small businesses

138
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,960
since about

139
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,759
2014. so um i think that that experience

140
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,758
of working with startups and small

141
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,960
businesses from the ground up

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,840
has really helped me with

143
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,478
cannabis clients because a lot of these

144
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,679
clients

145
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:13,120
are starting from from ground zero

146
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,879
so um yeah i'm really excited to be

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,079
joining forces with mark and to be

148
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,600
providing world-class services to

149
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,599
cannabis clients across the u.s

150
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:28,959
great well i guess uh you know for me

151
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,719
i guess my first question would be um

152
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,560
what are some of the things as someone

153
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
who is setting up a facility

154
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,879
or a grow a legal grow in a state what

155
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,439
are some of the things that you guys are

156
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,639
seeing

157
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,519
as potential pitfalls or roadblocks that

158
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,918
people should be aware of

159
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,758
though i think right away it's the

160
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,000
challenge of just finding a bank

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,439
is it hits you right in the face when

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,560
you when you first start

163
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,279
um we we work with some some startup

164
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,839
farms

165
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,359
and uh you know some of them are are

166
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,000
lucky enough to to come to us

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,879
with uh a banking relationship in

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
existence and uh

169
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,159
some of our other clients are coming to

170
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,478
us and saying you know we

171
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
have a license we're ready to start we

172
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,279
bought some land but we don't have a

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,478
banking relationship yet

174
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,519
and cannabis are not and not having a

175
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,599
banking relationship

176
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,198
really puts you at a disadvantage right

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,560
away for account

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,240
for accounting because once once if you

179
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
don't have a banking relationship

180
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,519
and uh you're tracking things either

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
through

182
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,120
your individual uh your individual

183
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
accounts sometimes maybe you have cash

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,879
that you're working

185
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
with but it makes just the day-to-day

186
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,199
record keeping

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,240
much hairier than it really needs to be

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
which is unfortunate because so many of

189
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
our clients that we work with

190
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,120
want to do the right thing they want to

191
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,959
they want to be

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,478
uh you know upfront with their record

193
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,239
keeping they want to keep things really

194
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,359
organized so it really puts them at a

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,759
disadvantage

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,840
uh you know i've been i've been tracking

197
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,520
federal federal banking bills

198
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,598
and i think i think there's one in the

199
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,279
uh the federal government right now that

200
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,800
has some promise of happening

201
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,399
um but you know there's there's no

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,038
guarantee that it's going to happen

203
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:17,120
this year uh so so for the time being

204
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,399
growers that are starting a new farm

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
just get faced with

206
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,120
with that reality right away um that's

207
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,638
not even that's not even getting into

208
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
some of the other things that

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,840
cannabis growers have to think about

210
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,759
like section 280e

211
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:35,119
um handling cash handling internal

212
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,759
control for cash um irs

213
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
audits uh you know banks requesting

214
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,759
information etc

215
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,799
um just getting off the ground is hard

216
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,960
enough

217
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,439
so so mark um along those lines

218
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,478
if you were say a grower coming into the

219
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,079
legal market

220
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,318
and you may have been on the medical

221
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,079
side and working strictly in cash

222
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,560
you know you may or may not have been

223
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,159
paying taxes um

224
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,720
you may or may not have claimed all of

225
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
this cash do you have to be able to show

226
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,240
where all the cash

227
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,160
came from before you know when you go to

228
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,360
set up a banking relationship and then

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,199
if so

230
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,960
um you know how does that work from an

231
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,000
irs perspective i guess

232
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,680
um you know when establishing a business

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
primarily from you know a business has

234
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,439
been run by cash for for years

235
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,439
absolutely so so one thing that that

236
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,560
kind of goes unnoticed is that there is

237
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,918
an irs form called form 8300

238
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,918
that any business that is handling large

239
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,319
transactions of cash over ten thousand

240
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,240
dollars is required to fill out a form

241
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,640
8300 every time they have those

242
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
transactions so just the administrative

243
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,958
burden

244
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,959
that alone is is huge and so

245
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,719
short of having a strong you know a

246
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,799
banking relationship in place

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
uh growers really have to think about

248
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,039
compliance right away

249
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
and it's not uh many many small

250
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,759
businesses

251
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,360
and are set up the irs i should say is

252
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,000
is geared toward helping small

253
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,600
businesses

254
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,278
get started but for cannabis businesses

255
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,759
they the iras does what they can but but

256
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,278
they are faced with something that's

257
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,519
that's really just kind of a

258
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,879
it's a beast right from the get-go

259
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,519
so i do want to talk a little bit more

260
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,278
about for 8300 but i guess my question

261
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,600
is you know

262
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,600
if let's just say i had a few hundred

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
thousand dollars in cash and i wanted to

264
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,320
start

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,839
a legal cannabis business um how did

266
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
from an accounting perspective how does

267
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,959
that happen

268
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,599
or is that more of a legal question um

269
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,119
in terms of

270
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,959
i assume you need to get the money into

271
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
a bank and set up a banking relationship

272
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,359
to where you can start accounting for

273
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,559
things

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,278
uh so that you have a audit trail uh

275
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,639
that the irs

276
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:51,039
yeah i mean but yeah i mean if

277
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,000
if there isn't a banking relationship

278
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,079
there yet

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,039
it doesn't mean that we can't do our

280
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
accounting

281
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,480
um it just means that how we do our

282
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,120
accounting is going to be a little more

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,639
complex

284
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,399
um we do have uh within our firm we have

285
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,879
kind of all the work papers that we need

286
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,120
to

287
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,000
to kind of handle any type of situation

288
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,399
so so

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,519
certainly there are our businesses that

290
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,759
have started that

291
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,120
that don't have a banking relationship

292
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,600
um they may have an attorney that

293
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
they've

294
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
hired and are tracking a few different

295
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,959
things from

296
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,719
how they're creating their entity you

297
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,719
know a lot of a lot of

298
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,320
new cultivators who are looking for

299
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,560
investors for example

300
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,839
might be looking to be founded as an

301
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,639
as a c corp which in many respects

302
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,560
is is more beneficial to new businesses

303
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,240
that are looking for investor dollars

304
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,679
um so there may be already some of these

305
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,000
professional relationships

306
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:49,278
set up um then what our job is as as

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,559
their their accountants is to track any

308
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,000
of those

309
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,919
those contributions to the new entity

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,759
um any expenditures out of the new

311
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,559
entity you know what we try to do is

312
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,200
kind of tailor

313
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,000
our accounting software in a way so that

314
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,680
you can kind of

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,039
track any any owner contributions or any

316
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,319
owner distributions

317
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,360
legal invoices any any of those types of

318
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
things that that

319
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
come into play especially from from a

320
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,680
startup

321
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,680
free revenue standpoint but it is really

322
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,319
important to capture all of those things

323
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,239
accurately because regardless of what

324
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
you have going on

325
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,639
uh once you start that entity the the

326
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,240
clock is ticking on filing

327
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:35,679
uh your annual reports with the irs and

328
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,879
certainly with the way uh irs

329
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,759
is is going right now there's

330
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,240
there's a federal movement to beef up

331
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,360
the

332
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,919
the budget of the irs to increase

333
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
tax compliance and collection on tax

334
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,199
revenue

335
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
i would i would be very surprised if

336
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,480
there wasn't also an

337
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,199
increased compliance effort made by the

338
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
irs

339
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,399
especially toward cannabis businesses

340
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,078
that

341
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,879
because of section 280e potentially can

342
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,919
earn more tax revenue and that's the

343
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,399
thing i think

344
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,919
this is this is just me opinion

345
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,159
opinionating here but

346
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,399
i do think when we're talking big

347
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,679
picture about section 280e

348
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,720
certainly as as legalization becomes

349
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,919
a bigger topic federally

350
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,519
um 280e is is a big piece that

351
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,078
obviously a lot of people want to go

352
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,240
away but the elephant in the room is

353
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,278
if that goes away where does the revenue

354
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,919
come from

355
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,838
so there there's certainly a delicate

356
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,000
dance

357
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,079
being done i think in the in

358
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,519
the federal government with respect to

359
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,599
that that

360
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
it would be great to legalize tomorrow

361
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,800
but there's a lot of things that need to

362
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,040
be sorted out before that happens

363
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,719
okay do you have any recommendations for

364
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,639
a new facility in terms of

365
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
potential banks to look into that you've

366
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
worked with or

367
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,439
also um accounting software that you

368
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,040
really like

369
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
i mean we use quickbooks online right

370
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,919
now but i've used a variety of different

371
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,480
accounting software um on my end what do

372
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,240
you find

373
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,680
most popular for for both of those

374
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,919
options

375
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,799
i can answer that question mark yeah go

376
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,000
for it

377
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,000
uh so i think in general um

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,519
those that are looking for banking i i

379
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,879
would i would look to your local credit

380
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,278
unions

381
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,958
um we've with with our clients we've

382
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,679
found that

383
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,479
uh they're able to establish banking

384
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,319
relations

385
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,639
relationships with more credit unions um

386
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,560
and and i in general think that credit

387
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,440
unions are great to work with

388
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,638
secondly in terms of the accounting

389
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,680
software

390
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,519
mark and i um we use

391
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,719
two different mainly two different

392
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,959
systems

393
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
quickbooks online tab which you said is

394
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,399
what you use and then

395
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,680
xero and i know some people have run

396
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,320
into issues

397
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,719
with quickbooks some canvas clients have

398
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,079
run

399
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,440
into issues with quickbooks so we are

400
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:10,399
sort of guiding most of our new clients

401
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,720
in the direction of xero

402
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,559
but you know in general what's great

403
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,360
about both systems is that they're both

404
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:22,479
web-based so that gives

405
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,120
that gives cultivators um

406
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,759
better access to their books being that

407
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,440
they can just

408
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,039
you know log on to the web at any point

409
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,120
and and take a look around

410
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,240
so if i may uh add to that a little bit

411
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,959
as well

412
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,278
um yeah like betsy like you were saying

413
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,518
the

414
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,399
the web-based tools are really nice and

415
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
one thing that

416
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,440
that makes working with businesses

417
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,360
not just cannabis but all businesses

418
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,639
right now really

419
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
interesting from an accounting

420
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,839
standpoint is is because all of these

421
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,639
tools are online

422
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,440
and so many of them are built to work

423
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,240
together

424
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
and interact with each other and having

425
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,000
a

426
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,360
an online platform for your base

427
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,839
accounting system

428
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,600
like quickbooks or xero gives you a big

429
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,800
advantage going forward because

430
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,920
as more tools especially in the cannabis

431
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,159
industry get developed all of those

432
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,919
tools are being developed in a way that

433
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,958
makes it so that it interacts with your

434
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,759
accounting software

435
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,679
so i would i would advise i'm i'm

436
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,679
personally not

437
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,879
for or against any of any of the

438
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,719
different accounting systems

439
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,198
i think they all have have pluses and

440
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,000
minuses but i would definitely advise

441
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,838
if you're thinking about going online

442
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,639
versus going desktop i would definitely

443
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,160
advise going online

444
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,519
yeah the cloud-based systems are great

445
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,600
i've actually done a lot of research on

446
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,000
this from my company um

447
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,159
because we were using quickbooks desktop

448
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720
one thing i'll say is switching

449
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,278
financial software is really challenging

450
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
from a

451
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,958
comparative perspective year over year

452
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,000
so once you pick one it's really great

453
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,958
to stick with it

454
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,198
um zero is great you know it's it's

455
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,879
actually spelled x-e-r-o for people who

456
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,799
want to look that one up

457
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,480
but for me it didn't work because uh

458
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,599
here in washington state if i ship

459
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,480
something to

460
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,560
eastern washington i have to pay sales

461
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,519
tax based off of that location

462
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,919
not off of my location and uh some of

463
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,600
these

464
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,278
for some reason xero just didn't offer

465
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,879
that functionality at the time

466
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,320
and so we ended up going with quickbooks

467
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,320
online just

468
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,680
strictly for that reason but you know

469
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,600
looking at what other software

470
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,000
integrates in is really important too

471
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,079
because you know i've had to have uh you

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,240
know apps and other software allow me to

473
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,679
connect my shopify site with

474
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
you know quickbooks desktop and all this

475
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,359
stuff so yeah

476
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
that's less of an issue for a cultivator

477
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,278
i think as it is for someone in the

478
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
retail side like me but um

479
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,320
yeah definitely look into that the pros

480
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,320
and cons are great and then

481
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,600
um in terms of the credit unions

482
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,839
yeah i've had the same issue that you

483
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,040
guys mentioned

484
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,160
my bank basically you know they told me

485
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,679
not to answer that i work in the

486
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,958
cannabis industry because technically

487
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,879
i'm not growing cannabis

488
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,000
so they were they felt okay about that

489
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,759
but if you say yes

490
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,279
you do which you have to legally if you

491
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,078
are growing um

492
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,798
it really limits your ability to to do a

493
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,078
lot of

494
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,759
banking stuff or work with a lot of

495
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,399
banks like i've been denied loans just

496
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,798
because

497
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,400
they you know googled my name i think

498
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,400
and decided that i was

499
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,600
in you know i fell into that into that

500
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,038
category so

501
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,119
right it's unfortunate um

502
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,400
yeah as far as specific banks to work

503
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,319
with um

504
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
if a new client comes to us and doesn't

505
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,000
have a banking

506
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
relationship established and they're in

507
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,319
another state that

508
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,160
perhaps we're less familiar with we have

509
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,639
contacts

510
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,558
within our network who can offer up

511
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,799
suggestions

512
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,678
of credit unions within that state that

513
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,319
state

514
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,880
that that work with cannabis clients

515
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,918
great

516
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
great yeah i think that's wonderful um i

517
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,080
i do want to talk

518
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,160
a little bit more about section 280e

519
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,079
i am looking at the definition for

520
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,558
people who aren't familiar with it

521
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,480
uh it's a section of the irs code that

522
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,558
forbids businesses from deducting

523
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
otherwise ordinary business expenses

524
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,519
from gross income

525
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,520
associated with the trafficking of

526
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,599
schedule one or two substances which is

527
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,798
where cannabis falls

528
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,480
can you kind of explain that in uh more

529
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,400
you know more common language as to

530
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,599
exactly what that means for

531
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:30,480
a cultivator yeah

532
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:32,719
absolutely so section 280e

533
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,759
your definition that you read is is is

534
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,519
spot on

535
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,960
the thing that makes it tricky for

536
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:43,119
cannabis growers is really twofold

537
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,558
one is the the record-keeping that's

538
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,918
required

539
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,279
to kind of have your ducks in a row with

540
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,360
respect to

541
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,399
ensuring that you would be able to make

542
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,519
it through an

543
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,400
audit of the irs are very tricky

544
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,200
and and the reason for that is is just

545
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,280
like you said

546
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
is there are a number of different

547
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,440
expenses

548
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,798
that for a quote-unquote regular

549
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
business

550
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,879
would be able to be deducted your you

551
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,038
know basically kind of anything

552
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
outside of the realm of the actual

553
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,200
production of

554
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:20,319
your product uh rent expense

555
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,360
uh you know utilities

556
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,159
uh you know meals and entertainment

557
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,079
travel

558
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,080
things like that that are a normal

559
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,558
course of business type of expenses

560
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,599
are generally not allowable to be

561
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,960
deducted

562
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:38,000
for cannabis growers so until until

563
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,160
until the federal law changes

564
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,640
to move cannabis off of schedule one

565
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,320
that is going to be the law of the land

566
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,720
and what that really means

567
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:52,399
is you're paying more in taxes and

568
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
obviously nobody wants to pay more in

569
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,600
taxes but

570
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,038
that being said you run a big risk

571
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,918
by trying to push the envelope too much

572
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,400
with regard to

573
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
what types of deductions you take on

574
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,640
your tax return

575
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,798
there have been a number of oh go ahead

576
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,038
oh so just to clarify

577
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,240
you know if you're working with a cpa

578
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,519
that's not aware of this

579
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,960
and say does take these as business

580
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,240
expenses you talked about meals

581
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
entertainment

582
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
you know some of these other things like

583
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,798
utilities uh

584
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,679
if you get audited you will have to pay

585
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,918
these taxes plus potentially uh

586
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,600
penalties or back taxes

587
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,520
on on this so in the long run

588
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,199
it could end up costing you quite a bit

589
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,000
if you don't claim this up front

590
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
is that correct yeah absolutely

591
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,519
absolutely yeah

592
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,080
and especially like i was saying earlier

593
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,359
there

594
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,199
there's definitely going to be an

595
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,678
increased presence

596
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,558
on cannabis as more and more states

597
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,440
become

598
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,079
federally legal and there is just that

599
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,519
kind of this

600
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:03,038
this this uh unfortunately

601
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,240
not many many cpas will touch cannabis

602
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,240
because of all the reasons that we've

603
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,759
talked about and so there's

604
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,720
a shortage of good cpas that will help

605
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,200
growers navigate through these kind of

606
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,038
tricky

607
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,960
tricky situations so

608
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,599
you know along these lines uh the one

609
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,159
that i see a lot on my end as being a

610
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,279
someone who provides soil and nutrients

611
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,720
and those sorts of things

612
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:31,279
is some growers that we work with

613
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,079
will give us a resale certificate or

614
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,000
some sort of agricultural exemption

615
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,158
either in the name of the business or in

616
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,119
a shell corporation of the business that

617
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,320
owns

618
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:45,759
that business is this

619
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,359
okay because it's about 50 50 here

620
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,839
in the state in terms of people who pay

621
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,479
the sales tax that are growers

622
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,079
and those that hand me a certificate and

623
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,839
essentially by giving me this resale

624
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,199
certificate it's passing the buck so if

625
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,240
i get audited

626
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
what's going to happen is they're going

627
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,720
to say hey why didn't you collect

628
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,240
you know sales tax from this grower or

629
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,679
this company and i'll say well they gave

630
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,798
me this resale certificate and it kind

631
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,320
of passes the buck

632
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,918
and they'll follow up potentially with

633
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,519
that company and say hey why

634
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,280
you know are you charging the sales tax

635
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,839
on your end does that

636
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,480
work with cannabis is my question

637
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,399
because i know

638
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,519
you know with farmers and other uh

639
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,759
non-cannabis

640
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:26,000
companies this isn't really an issue but

641
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:28,480
i don't i don't know with cannabis

642
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,038
yeah that's a really good question i i

643
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,720
would be

644
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:35,440
really cautious about

645
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,240
not doing as much as you can to stay in

646
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,400
compliance as a cannabis business

647
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,079
just because as cannabis becomes legal

648
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,679
there there's still all of these

649
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,199
different issues that

650
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
cannabis businesses are going to be

651
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,240
facing there's you know

652
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,360
if if it turns federally legal

653
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,759
there's still likely going to be you

654
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,759
know

655
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,879
local opposition you know certainly

656
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,519
you'll see

657
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,640
you know even in states where cannabis

658
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,759
is legal

659
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,840
there are often groups of local

660
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,158
municipalities sometimes means

661
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,519
independence depends on what the state

662
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,000
law is written like but

663
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,798
occasionally there can be municipalities

664
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,558
that say

665
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,400
the state law says that cannabis is

666
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,279
legal but we don't want cannabis in this

667
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
town

668
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,440
and so there is there's i would always

669
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
advise

670
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,000
any of our clients to

671
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,240
be overly overly compliant more than

672
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,119
than try to push the envelope just

673
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
because

674
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,279
there's going to be a huge target on on

675
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,240
their on their backs

676
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,720
so i do realize my question is is a

677
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
state

678
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,079
tax question versus a uh you know

679
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,519
national or federal tax which is what

680
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,879
the 280 eve

681
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,599
refers to um you know here in washington

682
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,799
for example

683
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,639
if i'm oh if i'm making

684
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,879
you know a product and i use these

685
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
inputs to go into my product i don't

686
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
have to pay sales tax on those inputs

687
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,919
because i'm going to be charging sales

688
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,320
tax to the final user so i'm not being

689
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,840
taxed

690
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:11,278
twice for the same product

691
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,000
but um i i maybe that's a state specific

692
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,038
question

693
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,679
i don't know if that's something you've

694
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,839
come across i was just curious

695
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,159
yeah i i think it's gonna it's gonna

696
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,480
vary state by state obviously but

697
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,320
um i do think that's going to be

698
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,360
something every state is going to deal

699
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,879
with

700
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,359
maybe slightly differently but

701
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
ultimately what's going to be most

702
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,599
important is that

703
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,120
you are doing what you are supposed to

704
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,000
do to pay

705
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,399
pay what tax that you need to obviously

706
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,440
try

707
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,559
not trying to overpay tax by any by any

708
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,200
means but

709
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,639
but doing everything that you can um all

710
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
the way down to something

711
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
something like an exemption certificate

712
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,960
uh sales tax or

713
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,519
exemption uh forms that you may have to

714
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,519
fill out

715
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,558
for your states um just doing all of

716
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,240
that as as

717
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:02,000
above above book as you can

718
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,919
have you worked with any campus corp

719
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,038
companies that have been audited

720
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,320
yet and seen anything there that were

721
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,319
things to watch for i guess

722
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,639
uh we haven't we haven't worked

723
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,600
specifically with them but um

724
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,799
we've definitely as as part of the

725
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,000
national network of

726
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,759
cpas that we're involved in we have

727
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,200
have seen other accountants in our

728
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,038
network that have had that

729
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,440
happen and uh you know there's there's

730
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,400
been

731
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,360
a number of different court cases some

732
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
that have gone all the way to the

733
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,798
supreme court

734
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,519
that uh a lot of us are tracking really

735
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,639
closely

736
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,918
um most recently uh the

737
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,080
the case regarding harborside which is a

738
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,759
cannabis business in california

739
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,678
uh went all the way to the supreme court

740
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,879
and they still ruled

741
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,519
uh in favor of maintaining section 280e

742
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,679
so

743
00:25:53,519 --> 00:26:01,599
there is there is still quite a bit of

744
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,720
um work to be done i would say

745
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,240
you know it the irs hasn't gotten to a

746
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,839
point yet where

747
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,319
um a point where like i've seen in other

748
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,319
industries

749
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,639
in my prior experience in public

750
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:18,558
accounting for example

751
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,640
in the mid 2000s the irs audited many

752
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:25,918
credit unions and that was a result of

753
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,799
finding parts of their business to be

754
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,360
not uh not really part of their exempt

755
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,079
mission

756
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,119
which resulted in a lot of credit union

757
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,798
businesses

758
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:39,038
um paying more tax than they needed to

759
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,918
or that more attacks than they had

760
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,839
expected to

761
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,840
and that really was a result of what the

762
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,119
irs i think is doing right now which is

763
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,480
kind of

764
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:52,079
gearing up their budgeting and certainly

765
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,558
you know cannabis could be a target for

766
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,079
increased audits like that in the future

767
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,440
we don't know for sure we don't know for

768
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,879
certain that that's going to happen

769
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,759
obviously the irs is not going to come

770
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
out and say

771
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,200
hey we're going to audit you but um it

772
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
certainly

773
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,319
certainly would make a lot of sense that

774
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,519
that that would be

775
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,720
coming especially with the the

776
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,240
complexity of

777
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,798
the accounting um it just

778
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,519
it feels like cannabis client cannabis

779
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,079
the cannabis

780
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,720
industry would be sort of an easy target

781
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,398
um

782
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,399
for additional revenue with irs

783
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,398
and i and i would say too um i've

784
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,839
actually been on conference calls with

785
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,959
with the irs who section that would be

786
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:37,359
dealing with this

787
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,440
and you know a lot of people have

788
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,038
kind of a bad feeling about the irs that

789
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,440
they're they're the big bad guys

790
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,200
uh but when you actually work with the

791
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,880
people that are in charge of these

792
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,278
they don't they want you to stay

793
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,240
compliant in fact they

794
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,640
really like working with cpas like our

795
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,278
firm

796
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,200
because they're not necessarily the

797
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,798
subject matter experts either and they

798
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,720
want to make sure

799
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,319
the way that they approach things is

800
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,000
doing it right and they

801
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,000
they look to see what's going on in the

802
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
industry as much as we look to see what

803
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,159
they're doing

804
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,799
so um i you know and maybe this is just

805
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,240
me having

806
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,200
having worked uh with uh with the irs

807
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,679
for many years

808
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,558
on many different areas i don't see them

809
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,360
as the big

810
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,319
bad scary you know wolf in the corner

811
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,759
necessarily

812
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,759
but you do want to make sure that you're

813
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,798
doing what's right and

814
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,000
and following what they have to say they

815
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,798
have actually

816
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,200
over the past year they have released

817
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,679
more

818
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,319
information about marijuana related

819
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,360
businesses

820
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:42,079
um actually if you google irs marijuana

821
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,079
they put out a really nice web page uh

822
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,439
probably six months ago that that

823
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,000
starts to talk about some of these

824
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,000
things so i would just say

825
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,759
they're not they're not scary

826
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,798
necessarily if you're doing things right

827
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,599
but you want to

828
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,599
do things right

829
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,159
yeah you know i've had a kind of a

830
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,798
roller coaster relationship with irs

831
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,240
myself you know we got audited uh you

832
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,679
know before we were ever even doing

833
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,440
business in the cannabis industry and uh

834
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,600
the lady who came out did our audit was

835
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,159
really nice but man it's it's a ton of

836
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,558
hours

837
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,919
it's a lot of uh it's a lot of work and

838
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,000
even if you're trying to do things by

839
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,840
the book it's really easy to screw up

840
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,079
um unrelated to that audit i uh

841
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,158
got a letter in the mail oh it was

842
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,720
probably like 10 years ago now

843
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,320
from the irs saying i owed 15 000 in

844
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,360
back taxes

845
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,558
and basically uh what happened was i had

846
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,798
you know when i was setting up my

847
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,079
business paypal account

848
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:42,000
i had put in my social security

849
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,918
number instead of the business ubi

850
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,759
number because it had a spot for my for

851
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,000
a social security number

852
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,278
and then when the laws changed around uh

853
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,440
the accounting for

854
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,839
you know companies like paypal right

855
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,919
around that time

856
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:58,000
um they came after me for claiming i

857
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,520
hadn't paid taxes now i paid taxes on it

858
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,119
through the business

859
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,720
uh because it was business income that

860
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,439
money did not go directly to me it went

861
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
to the

862
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,360
business which was owned by my parents

863
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
at the time so we had accounted for it

864
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,479
there but getting this corrected with

865
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,119
the irs

866
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,679
uh i probably had 60 hours on the phone

867
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,079
with them

868
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,360
at least just on hold and then talking

869
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,839
to them and you know they're like hey

870
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,519
you need to go into the local irs office

871
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,720
so then i have to go and make an

872
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,960
appointment

873
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,159
and the lady there like she legitimately

874
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,558
laughed at me and she's like

875
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,760
you're wasting my time i absolutely

876
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:31,599
cannot help you with this

877
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,119
you need to go uh you need to go back

878
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,278
and talk to him on the phone

879
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,158
and it was a nightmare the whole time

880
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,398
you know i've got this

881
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,600
fifteen thousand dollar bill that's

882
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,119
accruing

883
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,119
you know more and more penalties and

884
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,639
finally i ended up paying

885
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,479
my cpa at the time um over

886
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,840
two thousand dollars to essentially just

887
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,919
write a stupid letter

888
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,199
saying that we'd accounted for it

889
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,240
another way but

890
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,880
you know it took me about two months

891
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,558
of trying to get this figured out and uh

892
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,559
it was a nightmare and even then you

893
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,960
know having to pay that money to my cpa

894
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,720
who i think overcharged me quite a bit

895
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,120
um

896
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,000
it just it's it's not fun and it it's

897
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,839
really easy

898
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,919
you know it was a simple mistake i made

899
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,278
i just i saw a spot for social security

900
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,159
number i put it in and i shouldn't have

901
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,759
i should have used my federal tax id so

902
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
it's just the little stuff like that

903
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,440
that can get you and it's really

904
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:28,000
frustrating yeah oh yeah

905
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,720
yeah i can't believe that it could be

906
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
really scary

907
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,839
um and that's kind of the the the value

908
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
that we bring

909
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,398
uh to clients is making sure that

910
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,720
they're audit ready at any given point

911
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,918
and ultimately that helps them sleep at

912
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,240
night so

913
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,559
um yeah that's kind of priceless to the

914
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,000
to the business owner it absolutely is

915
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,119
and i want to say that's sort of how i

916
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,038
heard about you was because i was

917
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,398
listening on clubhouse and heard mark

918
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,960
talking about form

919
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,158
8300 which was one of the reasons i the

920
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,840
main reason i want to get you guys on

921
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,080
the podcast because i never heard of

922
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,038
form 8300

923
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,398
and uh so why don't we start there and

924
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,960
then i'll share a little bit of

925
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,639
my backstory on it but um could one of

926
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,240
you describe what that form is and how

927
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,360
it relates to

928
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,960
you know our industry

929
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:22,158
yeah so so basically any any

930
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,278
cash payment that is over ten thousand

931
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,480
dollars

932
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,200
uh must anybody who receives that type

933
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,519
of payment

934
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,640
should file a form 8300 with the irs

935
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,000
so obviously for cannabis

936
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,278
businesses that don't have

937
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,440
a cash a bank

938
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:48,960
relationship or do a lot of work in cash

939
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,480
um that requires quite a bit

940
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,720
of extra paperwork that that

941
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,839
has to be kind of earmarked by form 8300

942
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,159
and there are penalties for

943
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,959
not filing those 8300 so when we talk

944
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,720
about

945
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,200
potential audits that could be

946
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,319
targeted toward cannabis businesses

947
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
certainly that's going to be one of

948
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,240
their

949
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,960
the irs's tools in their toolbox

950
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,599
of saying did you do you have cash yes

951
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,278
or no

952
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,879
obviously a lot of the business

953
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,079
businesses will say yes

954
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,519
and did you file all your form 8300s

955
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,439
most likely there's going to be a lot of

956
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,038
businesses that have not done that

957
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,558
and so that's just going to be you know

958
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,240
low hanging fruit for

959
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:37,918
for audits yeah so

960
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,839
when i heard mark talking about this uh

961
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,360
it kind of surprised me because i heard

962
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,079
something around this ten thousand

963
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,918
dollar mark

964
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,720
and i've taken a few transactions like

965
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,038
that and i thought the bank was filing

966
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,798
them

967
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,000
on my behalf uh and so if i ever deposit

968
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,440
more than ten thousand dollars

969
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,679
they would fill out a form and send it

970
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,600
off and i thought that was the end of it

971
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,519
and since i'm doing everything legal i

972
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,158
figured that was enough

973
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,599
what i learned was the bank doesn't send

974
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,480
anything

975
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,759
they have an internal process over and i

976
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,679
i can't remember the number at my bank

977
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,838
it might have been 5 000 or 8 000. where

978
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,440
they make a notation on my account

979
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,480
but they're not sending anything off to

980
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,240
the irs it's it's my responsibility

981
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,838
to fill out this form and uh the other

982
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,759
thing i learned was that

983
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,838
um all transactions that are considered

984
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,119
related and exceed that 10 000 as a

985
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,639
whole must be reported

986
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,720
so it doesn't matter how many

987
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,320
transactions transactions a deal is

988
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,000
broken into or

989
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,000
how long within you know a 12-month

990
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,320
period if you space it out

991
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,358
if the irs considers them related you

992
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,079
can be penalized for failing to file so

993
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,679
uh there's some nuances with it that go

994
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,200
along with it too and as someone who

995
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,480
tries to follow the rules and

996
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,878
you know as someone who tries to be

997
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,559
compliant this was something that i had

998
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,199
you know dropped the ball on strictly

999
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,519
out of ignorance

1000
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,598
right right exactly and i think that's

1001
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,358
that's going to be the case for a lot of

1002
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,720
a lot of businesses because it's also

1003
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,519
not a very

1004
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,239
widely uh widely circulated piece of

1005
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,800
information

1006
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,279
um you know the irs you know i talk

1007
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,039
about

1008
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,400
their website their website is actually

1009
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,079
very good and it does have very good

1010
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,720
resources about this but it is fairly

1011
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,119
clear

1012
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,039
when you read into the the form 8300

1013
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,400
reference guide um on the

1014
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:25,920
on the irs website what is required and

1015
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,079
and what's uh you know

1016
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,920
what you could be facing if you don't do

1017
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,680
it so you know you scroll all the way to

1018
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,119
the the penalty section and it goes

1019
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:37,039
right into

1020
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,519
civil penalties uh for negligent failure

1021
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,838
to

1022
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,599
file can be up to you know starting with

1023
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,078
a hundred dollars not to exceed

1024
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,519
not to exceed 1.5 million for per

1025
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,320
calendar year so

1026
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,800
range they absolutely do not mess around

1027
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,440
with this

1028
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,560
um obviously the the purpose of form

1029
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,519
8300

1030
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,279
uh is a good one i mean the real purpose

1031
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,960
is to provide an audit trail

1032
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,200
for uh to to avoid anti-money laundering

1033
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,880
basically to

1034
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:09,519
enforce anti-money laundering efforts

1035
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,160
so having a paper trail with irs

1036
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,199
certainly

1037
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,838
it covers you if you are dealing with

1038
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,759
a lot of cash transactions and they are

1039
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,199
all for legal cannabis

1040
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,680
certainly you want to have yourself

1041
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,799
covered as well as as a business owner

1042
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,519
um but well yeah i would want to be

1043
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,119
aware too

1044
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,639
if someone el you know if i'm paying

1045
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,000
anything with a cash transaction that

1046
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,039
they're going to be listing this down

1047
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,159
because you actually

1048
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,960
um put the identity of whom the cash was

1049
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,719
received from

1050
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,039
you can select if you think it's a

1051
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,559
suspicious transaction

1052
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,079
if you don't get all the information

1053
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,679
that you need from them but it's a

1054
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,880
fairly

1055
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,319
extensive report and you have 15 days

1056
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,079
from the time of receiving the money to

1057
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,200
get this filed

1058
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,240
so it's good to know like i now that we

1059
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,399
know about it we're

1060
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,000
absolutely doing this and so i have to

1061
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,599
talk to growers and say hey you know if

1062
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,519
you want to pay me cash

1063
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,800
be aware that this is a form that i have

1064
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,119
to fill out legally

1065
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,519
um yeah and so they're aware that their

1066
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,000
names going down in this information now

1067
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,880
the other thing too to be aware of is

1068
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,960
you know whether

1069
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,160
they deposit that cash directly into the

1070
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,599
bank account

1071
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,759
you know um or they uh

1072
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,280
you know send a cashier's check or a

1073
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,880
money order all of those things are

1074
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,160
considered cash

1075
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,760
so the only just be aware of that that

1076
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,519
that you don't get around it by you know

1077
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,960
doing money orders in thousand dollar

1078
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,880
increments you're still

1079
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,400
expected to fill out this form or

1080
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,880
someone's expected to fill out this form

1081
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,559
if you pay in that manner

1082
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,880
absolutely so um

1083
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,880
yeah that was the biggest thing i wanted

1084
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,160
to cover in this podcast because it was

1085
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,280
it was totally new to me

1086
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:51,838
um so thank you for

1087
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,599
allowing us to get that out is there is

1088
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,960
there anything else in terms

1089
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,838
of you know potential things to watch

1090
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,400
for

1091
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,880
or even things you know warning signs

1092
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,880
maybe

1093
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,200
that maybe your cpa isn't up to speed on

1094
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,680
your industry uh

1095
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,439
what are the the things that like i'm

1096
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,838
thinking as a grower

1097
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,200
what what can i look for to sort of

1098
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,199
improve my accounting process

1099
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,599
um i can start with that one i i think

1100
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,880
you know we talk a lot about cannabis

1101
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,200
specific

1102
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,680
things such as uh section 280e

1103
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:32,159
you know increased compliance efforts

1104
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:35,358
that are required for banks for

1105
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,639
cannabis but i always come back to

1106
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:40,000
the accounting 101 or your accounts

1107
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,598
reconciled

1108
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,119
and it doesn't matter if you're a

1109
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,000
cannabis business or

1110
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,039
you're a flower shop in town or you're a

1111
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,800
restaurant

1112
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,279
if your accounts are not reconciled if

1113
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,440
your

1114
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,440
inventory is not reconciled if your cash

1115
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,800
is not reconciled

1116
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,400
those are also low-hanging fruit for

1117
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,800
for the irs and for auditors honestly uh

1118
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,280
there

1119
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,280
there are a number of different places

1120
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,720
both in the irs website

1121
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,839
um banks etc that expect

1122
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,319
that as a business owner you have

1123
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,519
reconciled

1124
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,599
reconciled accounts and

1125
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,039
that's challenging enough let alone

1126
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,599
having all of these extra

1127
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,800
complications as a cannabis owner but i

1128
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,000
you know when we start

1129
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,519
working with new clients we

1130
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,960
reserve about 90 days just to clean up

1131
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,199
your books especially if they're if

1132
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,800
you're a business that's coming from one

1133
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,559
account to another

1134
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,560
there's always things that we need to

1135
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,000
clean up to make sure that you're

1136
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,920
running like clockwork on a month-end

1137
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,400
basis because that

1138
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,320
that's that's your minimum requirement

1139
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,960
as a business owner is to have

1140
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,000
clean books that anybody can can look at

1141
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,838
and and review

1142
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,039
and and uh feel confident in

1143
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,320
betsy did you have anything you wanted

1144
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:05,440
to add in that regard

1145
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,800
i think mark said that perfectly if

1146
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,079
anything i would just say

1147
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,119
you know if

1148
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,839
if you're a business that um i think

1149
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,000
some people

1150
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,239
like i'll use the analogy if you haven't

1151
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,440
filed your tax return for five years

1152
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,519
um some people might feel embarrassed to

1153
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,119
approach a tax accountant with that

1154
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,239
information but

1155
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,760
we are here to to help business owners

1156
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:35,759
and so um i i would just encourage

1157
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,560
if someone is feeling intimidated by um

1158
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,520
by everything that has to be done from

1159
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,920
the accounting

1160
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,199
perspective or if they're feeling behind

1161
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,680
just to

1162
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,598
um you know not feel embarrassed about

1163
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,919
what they are be where they are because

1164
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,119
we we can always you know do our best to

1165
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,440
fix things retroactively so

1166
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,039
the important thing is just to kind of

1167
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,880
get get things right going forward

1168
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,079
absolutely and just to end on a positive

1169
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,920
note i do have

1170
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,400
a very good friend who was on the

1171
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,280
medical side wasn't paying taxes

1172
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,400
and you know for over a decade and was

1173
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,319
able to

1174
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,280
get into a legal campus facility

1175
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,159
get you know get squared up with the irs

1176
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,160
by working

1177
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:24,000
with directly with irs and his cpa and

1178
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,318
you know in a few years time was able to

1179
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,358
