00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,000
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
science podcast i'm your host

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
tad hussey of kiss organics this is the

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,518
podcast where we discuss the cutting

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
edge of growing from a science-based

9
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,079
perspective

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,439
and drawn top experts from around the

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,399
industry to share their wisdom and

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,399
knowledge

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,920
this podcast is about how a commercial

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,679
cannabis facility was able to

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,359
dramatically increase their yields

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,960
by making some small changes in

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,238
operations that allowed them to

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,640
incorporate science

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,479
and the scientific method which was key

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,679
in making decisions that both reduce

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,238
labor costs and increase

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,640
yields by more than 50 percent in this

23
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,320
podcast i talked with dr ben higgins

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,160
ben works with both gold leaf gardens

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,359
and kiss organics and is also a part of

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,119
our consulting group

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,878
he is the research scientist for gold

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,878
leaf and with kiss organics he handles

29
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,399
the custom blue mat designs for growers

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,158
as well as assisting with our product

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
development and research

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,080
ben earned his phd in ecology and

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,158
evolutionary biology from the university

34
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,840
of california santa cruz where he

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,640
studied functional ecology

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,478
organismal morphometrics and physiology

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,759
he lives in olympia washington with his

38
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,438
wife and two daughters

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,959
and loves to explore the natural beauty

40
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:23,839
of the area with them as often as

41
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,640
possible

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,159

always always a pleasure now you and i

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
talk all the time so

48
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,279
it's it's going to be pretty casual here

49
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,798
but

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,640
i wanted to get you back on the show

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,280
because i know you've been doing a lot

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,118
of

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,719
research and experiments that i thought

54
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,759
would be interesting to share with

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,759
listeners

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
and before we dive into what those

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,280
experience experiments were

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,118
i want to talk a little bit about how

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
you've you've been using science

60
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,280
to really increase yields and improve

61
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,279
your decision making

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,599
at the facility that you've been working

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,439
at uh over the past few years so

64
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,959
tell me a little bit about how you uh

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,758
how you started working there

66
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,519
uh what your role is and let's just give

67
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,559
listeners a little background there

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,000
sure thing um it's gonna be fun because

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,239
my background uh up until moving

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to washington and starting to work with

71
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
uh nate and all the other guys over at

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
gold leaf

73
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:29,598
um was strictly marine based i got my

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,760
both my masters and my doctorate

75
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:37,280
in uh marine based ecology um

76
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:40,399
so coming and then to olympia and then

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,719
getting kind of thrown into you know the

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,599
land of plants and soil

79
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,359
was uh it was interesting but you know

80
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,079
just as i got into

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
for example my my dissertation topic was

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
actually on

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,680
the functional ecology of mori eels the

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,959
california maury eel

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,239
and before i did that i didn't know

86
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
anything about

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,280
the functional ecology of the california

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,480
more eel

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,719
so um it's always a nervous

90
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:14,000
uh and exciting time to kind of be

91
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,840
um exposed to a brand new

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,598
system um and one of the things that

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,439
i've learned from my many

94
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,199
times working on different projects and

95
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,840
experiments all throughout my

96
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,238
educational and academic uh and now kind

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
of

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,120
professional career is that you really

99
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
need to spend the time to learn your

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,680
system

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,319
um and so for me even coming out of

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,799
you know fresh p h d graduate coming

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,318
into

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,719
a new universe um

105
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,439
i needed to live it i needed to soak it

106
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,639
up and i needed to

107
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,560
not come in to any situation thinking i

108
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,079
knew everything

109
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
because i didn't i didn't know anything

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,920
and to be honest there's still

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,438
a significant amount of what we're

112
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,679
trying to figure out that i don't know

113
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,919
but that's the point of

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,799
figuring it out right you you ask the

115
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,158
questions you

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,680
you observe um you listen to people

117
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:16,159
who have the experience you know some

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,840
back again i'll probably be trying to

119
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,079
draw a few

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,239
parallels to my doctoral program here

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,918
throughout this but um

122
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,759
you know when we were you know studying

123
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:29,279
morays and stuff

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,439
the uh fishermen and fishing companies

125
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,439
were invaluable resources because

126
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,000
they've spent the time

127
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,719
in the water you know looking for things

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
and

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,080
seeing things that you know folks like

130
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,639
me who were in a lab or in a classroom

131
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,758
i just don't have the time or the access

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,879
to

133
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,520
so um treating everybody like they're

134
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,800
their own

135
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:56,000
professional uh their own expert

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,720
is a really important um way to stay

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
open-minded uh regardless of anyone's

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,560
background regardless of

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,680
educational background professional

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,399
background

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,079
um or anything like that so um when i

142
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,079
got to gold leaf i

143
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,839
was very much aware that i was you know

144
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,159
as though again

145
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,119
use the term uh from fishing and stuff i

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
was a greenhorn

147
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
right i i sure i did the science i know

148
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,000
how to do science i know how to do this

149
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,359
but i didn't know how to apply it

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,918
to um cannabis

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
let alone uh but you know a tier two

152
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,399
operation which was you know

153
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,918
moving along and it had a standard

154
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,359
standard operating procedure it had

155
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,680
workflows it had

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
schedules and you know to to come in and

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
say oh

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,720
here's the scientist now who wants to

159
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,000
look at x y and z you know it's got them

160
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,759
fit right so i kept my uh

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
i kept my head down pretty much for an

162
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,879
entire year just learning

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,960
the plant learning the system you know

164
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,478
getting to work with the people

165
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:01,918
and just kind of figuring out you know

166
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:04,000
like i said my system my new study

167
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,198
organism which uh you know a lot of

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,319
folks will say is cannabis

169
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
but um i don't really look at cannabis

170
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,720
as the

171
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,720
as the target really for me um it's

172
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,600
about the soil because

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,800
i as coming as an ecologist that was

174
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,280
something that was

175
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,600
probably the easiest to translate to me

176
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,000
the physiology of animals and

177
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,400
metabolism of animals that's a wholly

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,790
different ball game than cannabis but

179
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,959
ecology is ecology so when i went from

180
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,199
[Music]

181
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,239
scuba diving you know looking at

182
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,840
underwater

183
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,079
communities kelp forests and

184
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,560
sandy bottom floors and i i understood

185
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,800
how species interacted and

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,038
you know ate each other or competed

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
against one another or cooperated with

188
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,478
one another

189
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
um and i was able to take that little

190
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,000
bit of understanding and kind of build

191
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,000
off of that in a soil framework so

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
similarly a goal leaf it worked out

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
really well because they

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,759
treat the soil the same way right it's

195
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,120
it's very much about what's going on

196
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,160
beneath the plant that dictates

197
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,360
what you see come harvest time right so

198
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,080
i always tell folks that i i see

199
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,680
i see the plant as a uh that's kind of

200
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,038
like an oil dipstick

201
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,680
right where the engine is actually the

202
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,478
soil

203
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,160
and if you look at the plant it's

204
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,279
telling you whether or not what's going

205
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
on underneath there

206
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,959
is healthy or not so um

207
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,719
with that kind of back round and

208
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,239
introduction i i slowly got more

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,720
comfortable i

210
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,160
learned the glossary i learned the terms

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,479
i'm still not great on the strains

212
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,840
because i was changed so frequently

213
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,758
um but then we started figuring out

214
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,399
little pieces of areas and

215
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,960
you know little pitfalls and little gaps

216
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,279
where oh

217
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,399
maybe this will be different if we tried

218
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,799
this or

219
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,000
we tried this so really it just boils

220
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
down to troubleshooting

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
and um once i got my feet under me and

222
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,719
once i got comfortable

223
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,400
and you know once everybody else there

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
was comfortable we could we could start

225
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,598
trying to

226
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,279
turn some knobs and you know adjust some

227
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,399
dials and see if we can

228
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,638
make things better yeah and

229
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,758
just to clarify you came into a facility

230
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
that was running

231
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,560
quite quite well i mean gold leaf i know

232
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,000
we talk about gold leaf a lot but that's

233
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,598
because they're good friends of ours we

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,080
have a strong relationship with them

235
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,718
right i actually hired ben and now i

236
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,399
share ben

237
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
with a gold leaf which works out really

238
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,158
well between kiss

239
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,158
and gold leaf in terms of being able to

240
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,200
do research and being able to trial

241
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:42,879
things

242
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,879
and so we're super excited to have ben

243
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,559
kind of going in both worlds but

244
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,120
you actually got in there you got your

245
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,359
hands dirty for the first year

246
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,639
working side by side with all the all

247
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,120
the you know gardeners or farmers there

248
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,480
really learning how to cultivate

249
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,440
cannabis

250
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,240
from the ground floor up and then you

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
and nate

252
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,519
uh who's the owner of gold they've

253
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,080
started to have conversations

254
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
about uh like you said things that you

255
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
could look at

256
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,319
that may improve yield or maybe limiting

257
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
factors

258
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
of growth what were the first things uh

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,320
what were the first questions you

260
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,479
started asked so let's talk about

261
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,760
about that aspect of it like how do you

262
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,240
go about formulating

263
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,519
the right question so you so you even

264
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,039
know what you want to look at from a

265
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,720
science perspective

266
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,039
right it's a really good question and

267
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
it's often one of the most overlooked

268
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,719
and most important parts of the whole

269
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,759
you know you'll hear the term scientific

270
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
process right

271
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,919
what you got to come up with a

272
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
hypothesis but there's a stage before

273
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,879
that

274
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,639
that's all the more important because it

275
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,720
really is the first stage and that's to

276
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,480
make an observation that's to know

277
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
what you're looking for you gotta look

278
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
for something to ask that question to

279
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
make that hypothesis

280
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,759
right i can't just go in the goal leave

281
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,920
and say well what about this

282
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,200
you know let's test this because i

283
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,838
didn't look and

284
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
you don't have that that background that

285
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
that

286
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,560
that reference point so

287
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,839
again spending that time not doing

288
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,199
anything

289
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,120
other than observing i was able to start

290
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,079
generating questions like

291
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,278
what if we changed this amendment or

292
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,278
what if we changed

293
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,879
our irrigation techniques a little bit

294
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,240
or the lighting techniques

295
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:29,360
or um you know what if we

296
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,278
and some of it wasn't even based on the

297
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,159
plant or the soil itself what if we just

298
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,200
made

299
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,759
the place look a little bit more like a

300
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,759
lab

301
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,039
like a like you know you have checklists

302
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,039
and you know you look at

303
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,480
make sure make sure things are checked

304
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,519
off and done and

305
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,879
you know just to keep the that whole

306
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,919
constant repeatable process round after

307
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,919
round

308
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,439
so that way if you are testing something

309
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,559
or something goes great

310
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
or if something goes wrong you haven't a

311
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,359
record

312
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
of where you might be able to look and

313
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,839
find that

314
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:08,078
so really taking the time

315
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:11,360
to generate a question is so so critical

316
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:15,278
because with a bad question

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,600
you can go forward and try to answer it

318
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,039
but you're gonna have a really hard time

319
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
getting an answer that will be

320
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,679
informative

321
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,440
um that that will

322
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,000
that won't end up costing you either

323
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,240
time money or both right because

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,039
you know unless your facility or your

325
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,879
little grow

326
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:38,159
has a little like a specific r d

327
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,240
room or you know section

328
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,719
you know most of these facilities are

329
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,959
trying to maximize canopy space so

330
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
anytime we take on a trial it's a risk

331
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,518
because if something goes poorly or it

332
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,039
doesn't

333
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,120
produce well which has happened um

334
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,719
then you're you're cutting into you know

335
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,120
your your products and your

336
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
yield in your bottom line and stuff so

337
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
um

338
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
you know we'll get approached by

339
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,399
numerous companies that wanna

340
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,480
want us to try this or try that

341
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,958
nutrients or

342
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
amendments and it's it's not always uh

343
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,000
yeah let's give it a go

344
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,000
it's we look at it we do our research we

345
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
ask the question we see

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,440
what it would cost you know how many

347
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,480
beds we can

348
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,959
sacrifice to the experiment um

349
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
and then we go from there so some of the

350
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,199
first questions that

351
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,879
uh nate and i tried to tackle were

352
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,399
of course which is probably the most

353
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,240
common for

354
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,759
for growers is how do i increase my

355
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,000
yields and

356
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,439
you know these guys at gold leaf are

357
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,360
incredible growers

358
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,040
so it wasn't that it wasn't very easy

359
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
to try to push that envelope even

360
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,639
farther because

361
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
they had such a great understanding of

362
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,240
you know soil ecology they knew what

363
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
they were doing with the plants

364
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
i mean again you're hearing this from

365
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,799
someone who had no idea what they were

366
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,879
doing

367
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,559
so um it was really inspiring to be

368
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,159
around these guys and try to learn as

369
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,439
much as i could and as fast as i could

370
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,439
to try to help

371
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,240
wherever i could and if there were

372
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,440
little parts and compartments of

373
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,440
um nutrients uh amendments uh

374
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
mycorrhizae products

375
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
those were kind of the first little

376
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,078
things because they weren't

377
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
huge investments to uh to try to see if

378
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,439
we could

379
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,278
you know bump the numbers up any percent

380
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,680
is always helpful

381
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,720
um and then yeah that's kind of how we

382
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,559
started and we

383
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,959
we would design little experiments i

384
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,559
would draft a proposal i'd show it to

385
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,039
nate and show him

386
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,679
you know what it would take space-wise

387
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,439
and bed wise and plant-wise

388
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,120
and there's always going to be that that

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
little bit of back and forth right

390
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,159
between

391
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:49,439
um making sure you have enough data

392
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:53,120
to to make an informed decision

393
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,240
versus getting into this stage of

394
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,519
i'll call it uh analysis paralysis right

395
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,600
where you

396
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,120
you got to make a decision at some point

397
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,480
and finding that

398
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,560
fine line between not enough data

399
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,278
and not being comfortable making a

400
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,958
decision based on the data you have

401
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,958
is tricky and that takes time as well

402
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,078
yeah and one thing i want to highlight

403
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
is that this scientific

404
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,439
method or practice doesn't have to be

405
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,879
applied strictly like you said to

406
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,880
cultivation

407
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,639
a lot of these things can be ways of

408
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,600
just it all fits in with sort of lean

409
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,839
manufacturing

410
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,759
and this idea that we can make

411
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,240
everything more efficient

412
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,958
and so for example you could look at

413
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
possibly

414
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,439
adding um like like you mentioned

415
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
documentation or clipboards that have

416
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,079
sops on them

417
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,159
uh you could look at that and then you

418
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,958
could measure well is this saving us

419
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,958
time

420
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,559
and that would be your your variable

421
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,439
that you're measuring is labor hours

422
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,719
in that case right is it reducing the

423
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
number of errors and that's something

424
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,920
you could

425
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,879
track so uh you have to figure out once

426
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,159
you have that question

427
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,320
then you also have to figure out what

428
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,399
the variables are and how

429
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,399
they have to be observable and they have

430
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,000
to be

431
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,958
quantifiable and i think those are

432
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
important things

433
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,000
i know i'm jumping the gun a little bit

434
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,879
getting into uh variables here

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,198
but looking once you have that question

436
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,120
and

437
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,319
and i think it would be good to pick a

438
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,198
cultivation question

439
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
because right a lot of folks can people

440
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,759
can relate to that so

441
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,120
exactly um let's let's take uh what

442
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,120
give me an example from one of the

443
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,039
experiments that you ran one of the

444
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,799
first ones

445
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,039
so one of the very first ones i did it

446
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,439
was a just a microarrival

447
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,278
um amendment that we'd add right before

448
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,560
transplant

449
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:43,600
and we were just wanting to see um

450
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:47,919
if if you know yields increased

451
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,720
now again um that's basically the big

452
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,278
question that

453
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,720
that a lot of these products are trying

454
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,559
to tackle is how

455
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,160
how does this increase my yield right

456
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,919
that's the question

457
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,559
um and that's going to show up

458
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,198
at the end of the harvest in wet weight

459
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,719
and then

460
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,078
we're trying to get better about

461
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
tracking that all the way through dry

462
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,239
weight

463
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,480
um but the mechanism

464
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,919
for how that's happening that's a much

465
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,519
much deeper question

466
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:20,879
that that's how you get into

467
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,480
the five or six year doctoral program

468
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,879
kind of kind of work is okay we see this

469
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,360
pattern where if i add this

470
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,000
the yields go up or if i add this the

471
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,959
yields go

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,399
down but the actual mechanism between

473
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,039
how that's happening

474
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,958
and what's causing that that takes a lot

475
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,559
of inquiry and a lot of experimentation

476
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,479
and a lot of time

477
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,838
that obviously not a whole lot of

478
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,000
businesses have

479
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
nor need to have right if it helps then

480
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,120
it helps if it doesn't

481
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,759
then it doesn't um and so

482
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,480
yeah like what the first one we looked

483
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,959
at

484
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,079
we added uh i can't remember the name of

485
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,439
the product but it was just a

486
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,439
mycorrhizal

487
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,040
association that we would throw into the

488
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,160
soil right before we

489
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:08,078
transplanted the the plants in and

490
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
we would wait and we would track some

491
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,480
growth we would look to see if there was

492
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,400
anything

493
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,640
terribly noticeable i did do some

494
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,720
image analysis so i was looking at you

495
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,880
know growth patterns and seeing if we

496
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,160
had tighter internal spacing

497
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,120
if plants were generally bigger

498
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,440
if they had um better secondary growth

499
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,439
development so if the stocks were bigger

500
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,200
at the base or fifty percent off so all

501
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,038
these kind of morphometric

502
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,360
plant measurements i was trying to track

503
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,720
and the end result was we didn't really

504
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,719
see a difference

505
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,798
and when i say a difference we didn't

506
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,440
see a statistically significant

507
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,319
difference and that's another thing that

508
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,919
you're gonna

509
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:53,439
um have to try to figure out is the more

510
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,120
plants you measure individually

511
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,798
the each one of those becomes a data

512
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:00,079
point right

513
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,359
and that grants you a lot more power to

514
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,599
detect a signal

515
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,399
of something making a difference or not

516
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,119
whereas

517
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,320
uh so for example let's say i had two

518
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,239
beds

519
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,519
of this treatment right we were going to

520
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,120
add this new

521
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,160
product and each bed had uh eight plants

522
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,079
in it

523
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,679
right and we had two plant and two beds

524
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,599
that were served as our controls right

525
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,960
we didn't add it

526
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:28,000
so if i were to then say

527
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,640
well there's two beds worth then my end

528
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
becomes

529
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,280
two if i'm just measuring the bed all

530
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,400
the plants in the bed together

531
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:39,038
that becomes an n of two if

532
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
i can spend the time and not slow down

533
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,759
the whole operation

534
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
to measure each of those plants

535
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,519
individually then my n goes all the way

536
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,918
up to 16

537
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,679
which is a much bigger number and you

538
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,320
can do a lot of more advanced

539
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
statistical analyses using bigger

540
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,399
numbers

541
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
you know things like analysis of

542
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,080
variance or anovas

543
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,799
if it's non-parametric data you can use

544
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,439
different tests but the thing that will

545
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,240
no matter

546
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,120
always limit you is not having enough

547
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,359
data

548
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,439
so i think we kind of go back again to

549
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,000
just finding how much space how many

550
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,440
plants can we get okay can we use

551
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,440
to confidently answer this question so

552
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,080
i want to add a couple things to this

553
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,480
one i think the big takeaway here is

554
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,359
we can't just say you know if we throw

555
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,839
two plants

556
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,558
in two pots and one grows bigger than

557
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,720
the other

558
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,960
there's no there's no way we can draw

559
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,798
any uh statistical significance

560
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,079
as to why one plant grew more than the

561
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,440
other so

562
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,199
it's important to have enough plants

563
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,440
which is our end value in this case

564
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,440
right um enough data points

565
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,558
that we can see like statistical

566
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,080
trending now

567
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,240
for a commercial facility they probably

568
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,918
don't have a research scientist on staff

569
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,599
you don't really need to to set up a

570
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,960
basic experiment so i don't want people

571
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,959
to be discouraged by that

572
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,000
no exactly you don't need to run anovas

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,120
you don't need to be able to do all that

574
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,038
but what you do need to do

575
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,000
is say okay this is important i'm going

576
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,480
to dedicate a portion of the facility

577
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,759
to be constantly looking at how we can

578
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,679
improve the way we're growing and

579
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,200
testing things so like in this case

580
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,840
with mycorrhizal fungus you found that

581
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,759
there in in your particular facility in

582
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,678
the in the way that you cultivate

583
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,359
it did not make sense to add mycorrhizal

584
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,679
fungus every growth cycle

585
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,038
now that doesn't mean that mycorrhizal

586
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,440
fungus doesn't work

587
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,960
it doesn't mean that mycorrhizal fungus

588
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,759
doesn't work in beds

589
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,279
over successive runs we can't draw these

590
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,359
conclusions that's where that five to

591
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,000
six year understanding of mechanism

592
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,519
comes exactly but what you can do that's

593
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
really powerful like you're saying here

594
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,480
is you can say

595
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,919
in our in this particular situation

596
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,079
it may not be worth the money that we're

597
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,400
spending to be adding this every cycle

598
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,079
now you could get interesting with this

599
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
and say okay well maybe we added every

600
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,279
third cycle did we see any advantage

601
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,079
coming back to this experiment in six

602
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,079
months

603
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:02,399
um so so there's a lot of ways a lot of

604
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,359
about this process creates more

605
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,360
questions

606
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,199
down the road i think and i think that's

607
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,558
important to be okay with that

608
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
not only is it okay with that that means

609
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,079
you're doing it right

610
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,599
right that means if if you get to the

611
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,240
end of an experiment and you have your

612
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,599
answer

613
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,919
and you're done you're not you're not

614
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,759
really addressing

615
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,759
you're not really expanding upon the

616
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,279
data you're collecting right so

617
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,879
to kind of go back to this example we're

618
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,678
talking about where

619
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,440
okay yeah it didn't work now that was

620
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,440
across one strain

621
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,880
at any given time we could have as many

622
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,159
as 10 or 12 strains

623
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,120
in a room at a time right so genetics

624
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,799
obviously is another variable that we'd

625
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,959
want to consider and to control for that

626
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,720
you'd want to run this experiment across

627
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,600
multiple streams secondly you'd want to

628
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,240
do this repeatedly right you'd want to

629
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,199
do this more times to make sure that

630
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,000
you know an n of one trial is really not

631
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,759
enough like you said

632
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,319
to make a really any kind of informed

633
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,558
decision so basically what you're doing

634
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,079
and again it's not complicated none of

635
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,240
this is complicated

636
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,639
it's very simply just looking for

637
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,400
patterns right do we see a pattern oh

638
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,919
it always shows up in this strain well

639
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,840
this strain seems to really like this

640
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,159
product if we want to use this strain

641
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,119
or keep going with this strain this is a

642
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,760
product that we might want to think

643
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,678
about

644
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,079
this product we don't see any different

645
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,600
so this product it affects it negatively

646
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:31,119
so there's there's always data even

647
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,319
um even negative data if you will even

648
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,158
data that

649
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:38,079
comes back to you and is not positive

650
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,440
is positive meaning that you've answered

651
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,759
your question

652
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,440
right the the end result of the

653
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,919
scientific method

654
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,679
is not to get better yields or to get

655
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,799
bigger numbers it's to just answer your

656
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,159
question

657
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,079
and the experiment is successful

658
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,480
if it lets you do that now whatever the

659
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,119
answer is the science is not going to

660
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,079
is is not biased right it's not going to

661
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,000
say

662
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,199
well you know you asked this question so

663
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,640
it was wrong so that means the

664
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,840
experiment was bad and your science was

665
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,840
bad not at all

666
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,879
the only time the experiment is not

667
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,038
great is when you

668
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,840
again don't have a clear question and

669
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:17,119
the data doesn't let you

670
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,879
support one way or the other well

671
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,479
i want to talk a little more about this

672
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,159
because i think as i'm thinking about

673
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,558
your example here i

674
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,640
it makes me realize like people will

675
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,200
draw conclusions that are inaccurate too

676
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,720
so

677
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
for example someone might listen to this

678
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,038
podcast and say mycorrhizal fungus

679
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,360
doesn't work in living soils

680
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,079
and that's not an accurate statement

681
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,038
based on what

682
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,158
no what experiment you did um we could

683
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,200
say that there may be

684
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,440
there may be cause for further research

685
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,960
uh but that's always the case but what i

686
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
think is interesting is we see this in

687
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,038
the industry all the time where people

688
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,038
will

689
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,720
say they ran an experiment they drew a

690
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,038
conclusion and then people will take

691
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
that

692
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,798
as if it is just you know written in

693
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,599
stone

694
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,240
and like for example if i was evaluating

695
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,240
this

696
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
your methodology i would want to look at

697
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,038
this and the first thing i

698
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,120
want to look at is like what is the ph

699
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,158
of your soil what were your phosphorus

700
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,399
levels in the soil

701
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,039
how did you introduce the mycorrhizal

702
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,679
fungus into did you check for viability

703
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,558
prior to introduction did you check for

704
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
uh

705
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,558
infection rates you know and i i know

706
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
you didn't do all those things because

707
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,240
that's a lot more science than you you

708
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,359
have the you know really the time or

709
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,038
ability to

710
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,240
um and that wasn't the question that you

711
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,319
were trying to answer you're not trying

712
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,240
to make

713
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,599
you know make those kinds of

714
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,359
determinations

715
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,359
this is a quick and dirty science

716
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,639
experiment for your facility

717
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,319
and these are this is sort of what i

718
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,840
want to get as people can do these

719
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,439
experiments themselves so

720
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,678
and they right and they absolutely

721
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,558
should right because whether people

722
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,759
realize it or not you know they're doing

723
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,319
science every day

724
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,200
at these facilities data is being

725
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,720
collected

726
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
right you're you're you're measuring

727
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,079
your harvest weights you're measuring

728
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,000
your dry weights

729
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,240
you're measuring your inputs you're

730
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,400
measuring you know your amendments your

731
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
irrigation all of these things

732
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,919
are getting measured and if they're not

733
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
you can right it there's there's no

734
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,080
secret to

735
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,159
well just put this down on a notebook or

736
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,000
on an excel file or

737
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,760
anything like that now the analysis

738
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,720
obviously does get a little bit trickier

739
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,759
but

740
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,600
um there's always potential to add data

741
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,200
you can't have too much data

742
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,439
um we for example

743
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,960
if you turn on the light switch when you

744
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,400
get home

745
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,319
right and the light doesn't turn on

746
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,759
you've just already made you've entered

747
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,480
the scientific process

748
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,919
unknowingly you made an observation the

749
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,599
light didn't go on

750
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,200
so now you're going through your head

751
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,839
and making hypotheses

752
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,480
well most often times the light bulb

753
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,119
burnt out

754
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,919
that's your hypothesis so what do you do

755
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,479
you test it

756
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,759
you switch the light bulb did it work or

757
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,679
did it not work

758
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,158
but either way you got an answer and

759
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,080
then from that point on

760
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,840
you make your decision in your next

761
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,439
experiment oh the light didn't turn back

762
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,720
on it must not be the light bulb this is

763
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
a brand new bulb

764
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
maybe the switch is broken and then you

765
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,759
test the switch

766
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,480
so that's you know people do science

767
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,158
a lot and i'd i'd love for it to become

768
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,278
such a thing where

769
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,960
it it it gets the appropriate name you

770
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,960
know troubleshooting

771
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,319
is what we do you know we're we're

772
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,759
troubleshooting we're trying to say how

773
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,678
can we make this better

774
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,960
what's that what's the what's holding us

775
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,600
back or

776
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,319
what can we add to break through a

777
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,158
little bit of a

778
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,240
glass ceiling here is there anything we

779
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
can tweak you know how do we

780
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
know we you know literally do we change

781
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
the light bulb you know and we have and

782
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,559
we did and

783
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,600
um we've we've seen the plants

784
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:52,158
respond and the harvest yields respond

785
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,839
accordingly so you guys have made some

786
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,400
leaps and bounds over the last couple

787
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,558
years

788
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,320
um i've seen the numbers in fact let's

789
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,240
let's talk about that here in a second

790
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,759
but uh what was one so that experience

791
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,558
you might you might save you know a few

792
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,759
hundred dollars

793
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:09,038
around on mycorrhizal fungus which is

794
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,480
is great but what would be uh what would

795
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,158
be another experiment that you ran that

796
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,679
may have been more impactful for the

797
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,679
facility

798
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,278
well if are we taking cost into

799
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,320
consideration

800
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,398
sure um yeah so um

801
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,000
the other really there were two big

802
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,798
impactful studies that

803
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,839
um i did and i i should probably say

804
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,158
this now

805
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,558
um the other thing about doing science

806
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,200
especially in a commercial facility is

807
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,079
it's not just one person's job the whole

808
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,919
team

809
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:43,119
needs to be on board and buy into the

810
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,559
to the data collection process right

811
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,639
um i am no longer just a grad student

812
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,000
who can sit at a lab

813
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,759
order facility for hours on end

814
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
collecting data and making sure that

815
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,038
things are going right it's it's just

816
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,880
not the was especially for me

817
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,720
being where i was and even where i still

818
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,799
am i don't have the expertise

819
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,240
if something goes wrong or what to look

820
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,079
for right like

821
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,480
if i asked the head grower you know

822
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,759
gavin or kaelin or chester anybody at

823
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,440
gold leaf

824
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,359
hey if this is working what should i be

825
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,759
looking for i didn't know that

826
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,639
i've never grown it before so to have

827
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,480
that kind of

828
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,520
you know teamwork of of mines

829
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,480
um is is so incredibly important so

830
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,839
it's not like you can just hire a

831
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,038
scientist and let him

832
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,199
or her run crazy in

833
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,640
some facility and collect all these data

834
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
and then come back with some report

835
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
because no one's learning anything at

836
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,679
that point

837
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
right that the whole idea of this is to

838
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,000
just

839
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,798
make sure that the the the company the

840
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,480
people you know everybody grows along

841
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,000
with the plants to understand how to

842
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,200
make things better

843
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,880
uh by just collecting data so anyway

844
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,120
to get back to your question um

845
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
the the first one that we tried was

846
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,678
adding the blue mat

847
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:07,278
irrigation system and um

848
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,480
we knew that it would be an ex

849
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:14,398
an expensive addition to the facility

850
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,839
um so we wanted to do our due diligence

851
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,678
and make sure that

852
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:24,398
this wasn't going to be money wasted um

853
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:27,840
so for three trials so three harvests

854
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:32,239
i took i tracked um 11 beds

855
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:36,000
and i looked at um what the plants did

856
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,720
in response to being irrigated with

857
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,278
um plain water irrigated with blue mat

858
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,679
systems

859
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:46,240
versus hand watering um and there are of

860
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,640
six different strains that were added

861
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,170
into that over the course of those

862
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,320
trials and um

863
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:56,399
[Music]

864
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:59,839
everything else was as best as we can

865
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:02,959
held constant we controlled for it so um

866
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,599
if the hand-watered uh

867
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,038
beds got compostees one day so did the

868
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,079
blue mats it just got added right over

869
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,720
the top

870
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,158
foliars stayed the same light cycle

871
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,200
obviously stayed the same these things

872
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,278
were grown

873
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,278
across the aisle from one another so we

874
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,278
even tried to control for microclimate

875
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,720
so we're not having plants in one corner

876
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,240
of the room as a test

877
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,558
and another corner of the room as

878
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,960
control we want these things to be as

879
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:26,480
close

880
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,640
as physically possible with the

881
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,558
exception of the one thing we changed

882
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,759
which is how did these plants and these

883
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,278
soils

884
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:38,079
get their plain water and

885
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,480
over the course of that time we saw that

886
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,839
on

887
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,319
average so across all six strains

888
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,359
we saw um wet weight increase yields go

889
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:50,319
up by 17.8 percent

890
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,639
so that was great because not only were

891
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,240
we

892
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,640
you know singing more more yields but

893
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,359
you know the times that the time we

894
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,640
needed to

895
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,158
have invested for labor to go in there

896
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,278
and water these rooms and hand water

897
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,320
these rooms

898
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:10,240
um that went away also

899
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:13,119
went away was the the variability

900
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,679
in just watering practices and you know

901
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,079
people

902
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,360
like i keep saying they really know what

903
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,240
they're doing there

904
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:23,918
um but you're just gonna have general

905
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,200
human variability in what somebody calls

906
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,840
perfect or too wet or too dry or too

907
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,080
damp right there's just gonna be you

908
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,359
know that variation in there um

909
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,960
regardless of how off

910
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,319
how long someone's been doing something

911
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,240
before so once we had those data

912
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,519
i was able to bring this to you know

913
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,200
nate and to

914
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,640
gavin the the head grower there and say

915
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,679
hey guys look you know after three

916
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,880
rounds

917
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,840
we have these six strains all five five

918
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,200
of the six responded positively only one

919
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,879
went down a little bit um when we when

920
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,159
we looked at these data

921
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,760
and you know then the the business minds

922
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,360
kind of take over and say okay well

923
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,599
what's the cost benefit of doing the

924
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,519
whole facility like this what does

925
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:12,480
17 percent to be a little conservative

926
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,679
look like if we're adding more yields by

927
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,000
that amount

928
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,080
how soon would we offset the cost of

929
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,398
retrofitting the entire facility

930
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,678
with a blue mat system what are we

931
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,918
saving on labor

932
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,840
so all of those other factors that again

933
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,559
are the next stage in the decision

934
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,959
process once the data has been collected

935
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,240
those wheels start turning and then we

936
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,519
all ultimately

937
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,440
come up with a decision now

938
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,720
you didn't have to do this because

939
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,399
ultimately what you shared right there

940
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,399
is enough information to make a decision

941
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,719
but you also looked at the

942
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,759
uh moisture content of the soil you were

943
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,319
measuring that

944
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,879
so you were s and and so then we're able

945
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,278
to make

946
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,399
just some uh hypothesis as to the

947
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,480
mechanism

948
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,000
because i know this is something this

949
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,000
particular topic was one

950
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,079
we've been talking about publishing um

951
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,440
yeah submitting the publishing on

952
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:06,000
uh to an actual journal but uh

953
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,759
you're able to see the fluctuations in

954
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,159
moisture level on the hand watering

955
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,440
because

956
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,799
you don't have anyone there at two

957
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,200
o'clock in the morning when the plant

958
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:12,798
may

959
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,798
when the bed may be drying out slightly

960
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,839
to add add more water

961
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,839
exactly and the the great thing too

962
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,359
the mechanism again going back to this

963
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,038
for the blue mats is

964
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,959
what the blue mats it with the blue mat

965
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,599
is sensing the sensors are actually

966
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,919
looking at

967
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,759
is the the millibar the soil the

968
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,720
pressure of water

969
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,879
that's within you know the the tension

970
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,120
of the water in the soil

971
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,640
so you know when you have all these

972
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,239
other irrigation systems

973
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,880
that run off of timers um you know those

974
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,440
are certainly better for saving at labor

975
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,760
but

976
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,038
a plant doesn't know what a thursday is

977
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,480
right and that was the same thing we

978
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,240
were dealing with

979
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,839
uh with handwriting you had and then

980
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,200
that's the right approach right you have

981
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,480
consistent

982
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,000
regimented watering days but

983
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,919
especially again if you're working with

984
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,960
genetics multiple genetics in a single

985
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,799
room

986
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,838
the scientifically sound approach

987
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,320
would be to water each bed the same

988
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,918
amount

989
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,599
right this bed gets five gallons this

990
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,319
bed for example gets five gallons this

991
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,559
bed

992
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,679
but to sit there and think well this

993
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,719
beds got

994
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,639
one strain strain a and this strain

995
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,719
in the adjacent bed is strain b

996
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,878
they if you give both of those five

997
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,358
gallons of water you may be severely

998
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:31,118
under

999
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,559
watering or over watering one of those

1000
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,760
strains depending on

1001
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,838
just their genetic makeup so what the

1002
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
blue mat allowed us to do was it would

1003
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:40,960
it allowed us to put the plants back in

1004
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,879
the driver's seat

1005
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,119
to say okay look i really like water

1006
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,118
so i am going to just be chugging along

1007
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,720
here you guys don't have to worry about

1008
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,039
adding anything else

1009
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,158
and then we saw strains that ran much

1010
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,199
drier than we were

1011
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,760
really comfortable going with um the

1012
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,598
soil

1013
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,359
surface itself started cracking in

1014
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,000
between you know where the drip tape was

1015
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,000
and

1016
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,358
we got oh gosh is this okay and we'd go

1017
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,119
and take a moisture meeting and sure

1018
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,759
enough it was holding

1019
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,358
right at around 80 to 100 millibars

1020
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,960
where it was kind of the target zone we

1021
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:16,480
hypothesized

1022
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,720
uh to be and it

1023
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,079
and it worked out well now that's

1024
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,399
another thing to talk about though

1025
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,560
is let's say it hadn't worked can we say

1026
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,639
that blue mats don't work or can we say

1027
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,440
that maybe we need to try it at 60

1028
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:32,000
millibar or 120 millibars exactly

1029
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,880
or maybe that one particular cultivar

1030
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,719
slash strain

1031
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,880
uh actually would have prefers

1032
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,399
wetter or drier soil so there's there's

1033
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,000
still questions

1034
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,800
to be asked regardless of the outcome

1035
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,838
of your trial but in this case it was it

1036
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,320
was pretty apparent

1037
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:55,599
17 is a great increase in wet weight

1038
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,000
and just as a small plug here ben

1039
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,640
actually does custom blue matte designs

1040
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,559
through kiss

1041
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,879
now for people who want to set up a

1042
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,519
trial or outfit their facility with blue

1043
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,119
mats

1044
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,880
he's done tons of them now

1045
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,800
we have a little bit of a unique design

1046
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,000
that we've actually got data to support

1047
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,680
which i feel really good about

1048
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,960
so don't hesitate to reach out if that's

1049
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,440
something people are interested in

1050
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,280
trying now

1051
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,880
i don't want this to be all just about

1052
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,359
blue mats this is just something that

1053
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,760
worked

1054
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,039
really well for you guys with beds in a

1055
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,720
facility

1056
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,239
and is a great example of how you can

1057
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,399
increase yield so

1058
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,919
17 increase you're able to implement

1059
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,480
that that's a huge increase

1060
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,519
in your facility and a massive decrease

1061
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,280
in labor i mean

1062
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:41,599
watering is such a big labor suck

1063
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,960
and i think you know just to say

1064
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,960
something positive about blue mats the

1065
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,838
idea that uh you have a tensiometer

1066
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,320
measuring

1067
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,679
in every bed what that plant needs is

1068
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,079
really great because

1069
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,000
like you said one one cultivar may want

1070
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,079
less water than the other and so if you

1071
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,320
have an irrigation system on a timer

1072
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,839
there's it's you know maybe slightly

1073
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,680
better than hand watering

1074
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:02,960
right it'll save on labor but it doesn't

1075
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,519
address the i

1076
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,039
i i'm a plant it what does tuesday mean

1077
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,920
to me right the tuesday is what is a

1078
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,239
tuesday

1079
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,760
i don't need this right now yes and from

1080
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,598
a microbial perspective

1081
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,800
keeping the soil evenly moist is going

1082
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,000
to increase

1083
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,119
uh optimal optimal microbial uh

1084
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,880
growth and activity so it's it's a

1085
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,280
win-win all the way around

1086
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,599
yeah and well again the the night the

1087
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,160
nice thing too about not just the result

1088
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,760
but was

1089
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,358
it was how the experiment worked right

1090
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,480
this was a big decision

1091
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,400
it was expensive we we took a little bit

1092
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,480
of time we figured out that sweet spot

1093
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,559
for how much data we would need to make

1094
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,079
this kind of a decision

1095
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,759
and we didn't trust really anything

1096
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,440
other than what the plants showed us and

1097
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,839
that's kind of the underlying theme that

1098
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,358
i hope

1099
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,039
a lot of folks can maybe take away from

1100
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,078
this is

1101
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,480
you'll hear so many different people

1102
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,760
and read so many different things and

1103
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,039
again

1104
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,839
even me or gold leaf like this works for

1105
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,400
us and what you hear from somebody else

1106
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:09,119
either worked or did not work for them

1107
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,480
but the best indicator again is going to

1108
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,640
be that

1109
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,400
if you're growing in living soil that

1110
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:17,118
dipstick the plant itself

1111
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,720
if it looks at the plant and let the

1112
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,960
plant tell you

1113
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,959
if it's working or not and you don't

1114
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,039
have to sacrifice

1115
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,720
really all that much to start collecting

1116
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,039
just a little bit of data

1117
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,199
on these plants that will then give you

1118
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,079
so much more confidence

1119
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:37,679
on whether or not to make an inexpensive

1120
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,680
move or or an expensive one

1121
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,520
so what was the next experiment that you

1122
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,160
guys tried over there

1123
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,759
so we got blue mats fully implemented

1124
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,078
and uh that took a little bit of time

1125
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,240
and

1126
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,000
there was some you know the new system

1127
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,759
so we had to do some training

1128
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,039
and there were a couple kinks we worked

1129
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,240
out like

1130
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,400
um i was putting the the sensors too

1131
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,358
close to the drip tape and it was like

1132
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,160
having the thermostat you know too close

1133
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:03,759
to the ac

1134
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,679
vent right so there was there's a couple

1135
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,839
of different things that we had to

1136
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,440
you know correct and that's the other

1137
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,838
thing that you know

1138
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,639
science is you're never done so if you

1139
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:14,639
do something

1140
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,838
expect to change it not too much you

1141
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,559
know it's not too much

1142
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,078
down the road um so once we had all that

1143
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,599
dialed in and we were seeing these

1144
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,119
these yields get better and the labor

1145
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,880
cost went down

1146
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:30,480
um we then started hypothesizing well

1147
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,160
the plants now have adequate nutrients

1148
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,519
we were pretty sure that based on soil

1149
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,838
tests you know working with you

1150
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,039
and and amendment recipes and things

1151
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,960
like that so we knew the nutrients were

1152
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,838
there we knew the irrigation was there

1153
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
the last you know kind of piece to the

1154
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,799
trifecta

1155
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,639
was well are we limiting these plants

1156
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,800
with their photosynthetic ability

1157
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,400
so are we not giving them they got the

1158
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,039
access to the nutrients

1159
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,519
the microbes the water but what about

1160
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:59,279
the stuff that comes from the ceiling

1161
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:01,920
so um we were watching

1162
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,519
the lighting market for that for all of

1163
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,960
2019

1164
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:09,519
and it really is booming in a way that's

1165
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,159
almost tough to find your way in it's

1166
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:15,838
like trying to jump into a raging river

1167
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:19,039
um so we went to a conference

1168
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,440
right um with we were there with you and

1169
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:21,358
we

1170
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,079
started really thinking about this idea

1171
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:28,159
of transitioning um

1172
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:31,359
gold leaf over to led lights

1173
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,838
and up until that point they were using

1174
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:37,119
you know thousand watkavita hps

1175
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,759
very common and we

1176
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,960
went with that same approach of testing

1177
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,760
just a few beds just a few beds worth

1178
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,720
of space under different lighting

1179
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,839
companies

1180
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,679
excuse me that were

1181
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,039
you know reputable some were new some

1182
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,759
were you know

1183
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,960
been around for a minute um and we

1184
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,880
wanted to see

1185
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,358
how these um these different lighting

1186
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,559
companies how they how it influenced our

1187
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,759
yields and

1188
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,838
beyond that yields are

1189
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,960
obviously one of the major pieces to the

1190
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,239
puzzle

1191
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,000
but when you get into lighting and

1192
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,039
starting to change spectrums

1193
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,838
um you know you're starting to then get

1194
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,759
into

1195
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,119
actual chemical expression cannabinoid

1196
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,680
expression

1197
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,599
so we wanted to track that data as best

1198
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,440
we could as well so

1199
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,039
for this next experiment it was a little

1200
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,039
bit more of an analysis

1201
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,639
task where we didn't just go for wet

1202
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:33,358
weight but we went for dry weight as

1203
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,960
well

1204
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,880
we wanted to make sure that the yield we

1205
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,318
were seeing weren't just in the stocks

1206
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,519
and the leaves

1207
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:43,519
um but actually in the sellable product

1208
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,880
and we wanted to do terpene testing as

1209
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,559
well right so we wanted to make sure

1210
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,519
that yeah that we grew more of this

1211
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,920
stuff

1212
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,759
but it was you know way less potent or

1213
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,519
the flavors were all over the place

1214
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,680
so those are all different questions we

1215
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,280
had right how does it infect dry weight

1216
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,199
how does it affect the wet weight how

1217
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,720
does it affect the terpene expression

1218
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,480
and those questions right there

1219
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,959
automatically steered us to the kind of

1220
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,280
direct

1221
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,079
that kind of data we knew we needed to

1222
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,760
collect

1223
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,280
to make this kind of a decision so

1224
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,920
so tell us about how it went i mean

1225
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,920
drumroll let's give them some let's give

1226
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,159
them some of the answers so

1227
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,119
you guys found uh you know without

1228
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,000
calling out any

1229
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,000
one company uh over another in terms of

1230
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,838
the led results can you at least share

1231
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,960
what some of the variability was without

1232
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,838
naming names or

1233
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,240
yes absolutely so um and i should step

1234
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,559
back to before we even got to that phase

1235
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,639
we

1236
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,239
knew very much ahead of time that this

1237
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,719
would not be

1238
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,838
a grab it all at once throw it in the

1239
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,639
facility kind of thing

1240
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,400
so if you were a facility like us and

1241
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,838
you wanted to know well i've got a

1242
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,000
little bit of money and i'd like to

1243
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,239
start to make this transition

1244
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,719
where do those leds most benefit you so

1245
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:58,559
the preliminary experiment we ran

1246
00:42:54,719 --> 00:43:02,078
was introducing leds at various stages

1247
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:05,519
of the grow process so we had

1248
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,079
some mothers placed under leds we had

1249
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,000
some of our early transplanted clones

1250
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,000
under leds and we had some of our

1251
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,679
flowers under leds

1252
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,880
and then we got to have some real fun by

1253
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:21,759
crisscrossing these different treatments

1254
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,960
so what i mean is let's say for example

1255
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,599
you had

1256
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
a plant that was grown in a cloner or so

1257
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,440
let's go

1258
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,639
before that the mother was under an led

1259
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,679
and then it was put in the cloner the

1260
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,440
the

1261
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,719
clipping was put in the cloner came out

1262
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,440
and then that

1263
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,679
clipping went under led and then it was

1264
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,119
transplanted under led

1265
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,358
but you can see at any one of those

1266
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,838
different stages aside from the cloner

1267
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,838
that you could go differently right well

1268
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,599
what if the mother came from hps

1269
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,358
then the clone went to hps but then went

1270
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,880
straight into l e d

1271
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,739
and all of those different possible

1272
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,000
combinations and we tested all of those

1273
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:59,279
[Music]

1274
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,679
and we found something pretty

1275
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,119
interesting which was you know if you

1276
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,879
started out

1277
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,358
with a clone under an led

1278
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,358
and you moved it to hps it was extremely

1279
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,440
unhappy

1280
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,559
however if you started a clone out under

1281
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,200
hps

1282
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,318
and moved it into an led it seemed to be

1283
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,679
doing it just fine

1284
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:25,838
in fact it did about the same as an hps

1285
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:28,879
to an hps uh clone to flower

1286
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:31,920
the best of course was when we saw

1287
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,079
the led clone the led mother

1288
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,720
and the led flower so once you had all

1289
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,599
three of those we saw the best yields

1290
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:42,078
so that was the first little nugget we

1291
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,599
had as far as okay well if we do this

1292
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,119
we definitely know we need to put them

1293
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,838
in the flower rooms first

1294
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,318
because if we put them anywhere else

1295
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:49,440
then

1296
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,000
we're actually going to be hurting

1297
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,960
ourselves so where to put the leds was a

1298
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,920
question

1299
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,358
whether or not we were going to do it

1300
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,599
anyway so then we did that

1301
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:05,358
and we found that um all three led

1302
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,119
companies we tested fared and i can say

1303
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,960
significantly better we have the data

1304
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,599
actually we ran the tests

1305
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,240
significantly better than the hps uh

1306
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,680
output

1307
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:18,799
the yields so a lot of folks

1308
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:21,440
would say well that's pretty obvious and

1309
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,200
you know it is but then we took it a

1310
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,000
little bit further and actually looked

1311
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,399
at

1312
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,480
well what's the wattage use here how

1313
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,358
much you know what's what's the cost how

1314
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,318
many

1315
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,400
grams per light or are we getting is

1316
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:36,400
them is the normal metric but also

1317
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,400
how many grams per watt right because

1318
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,400
what you put in there

1319
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,599
is money going away versus what you're

1320
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,000
getting out

1321
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,680
so after we looked at that we found that

1322
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,760
there was a bit of a difference between

1323
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,358
the led companies as far as

1324
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,440
how much energy it was going to take for

1325
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:54,480
us to produce the same

1326
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,519
gram of product

1327
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,519
and you also looked at cost per unit too

1328
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,880
exactly so yeah that's one more factor

1329
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,358
as well and

1330
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,559
uh one other thing i want to mention is

1331
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,920
i believe

1332
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,599
um when you transition from uh one

1333
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,519
lighting spectrum to another it's really

1334
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,318
important to dial back those lights

1335
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,679
especially switching from hps to led

1336
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,440
uh was that something that you guys

1337
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:19,039
addressed i hear a lot of people

1338
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,280
uh burning their plants because they

1339
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,159
don't take that yeah

1340
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,400
yeah the it's true the the the light is

1341
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,199
so much more intensely focused

1342
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,599
so that's both a good thing and a bad

1343
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,519
thing

1344
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,760
right so we were trying to do a total

1345
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,400
one for one change over basically every

1346
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,160
light

1347
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,440
where we had an hbs we were going to put

1348
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:39,838
an led

1349
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,000
and we did that and we saw really good

1350
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,119
results we did have to dial things

1351
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,880
down a bit um having up again

1352
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,318
a par meter you know we were talking

1353
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,000
about blue mass we're you know talking

1354
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:51,679
about tensiometer

1355
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,039
they're not an expensive tool but they

1356
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,879
can give you great data

1357
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,239
to make informed decisions and for this

1358
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,720
led

1359
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,078
project we had our a little par meter

1360
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,480
which is just looking at the you know

1361
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,280
photosynthetic reactive radiation

1362
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,400
to to look and see well geez and i know

1363
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,839
that's not the whole

1364
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,559
picture for leds but it is a great quick

1365
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:14,318
tool to have on hand to say oh my gosh

1366
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:16,400
you know these these lights are pumping

1367
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,679
out significantly more

1368
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,318
photons at this point at this height

1369
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,399
um relative to what the hps are so maybe

1370
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,159
we should kind of

1371
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,519
dial it back a little bit and and and

1372
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,039
ramp them up and

1373
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,280
that's actually something we haven't

1374
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,318
quite tested yet i mean we we do do that

1375
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,040
but we haven't really

1376
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,639
had got into the into the fun of well

1377
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,480
what if we start out at twenty and after

1378
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,480
three weeks we raise it to 35

1379
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,318
that kind of thing so there's another

1380
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,960
dial there that we're still looking to

1381
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,679
to play with but the other thing that's

1382
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,280
kind of a

1383
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:48,879
to watch out for if you do make the

1384
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,280
switch is

1385
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,000
um that footprint is so severely

1386
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,240
different like

1387
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,920
those eight those hps lights they're

1388
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,279
like flood lights you can hang them high

1389
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,760
in the ceiling and you get a really

1390
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,960
great

1391
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,960
cast of light across a really large

1392
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,559
uh you know square footage your lighting

1393
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,559
power density right

1394
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,000
but with it with these leds especially

1395
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,880
some of these manufacturers now are

1396
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,400
actually putting

1397
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,640
little um lenses on each individual

1398
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,720
diode which better focuses the light

1399
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,239
straight down which is great for canopy

1400
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,959
penetration

1401
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,838
but if you're you're going to be

1402
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,838
limiting

1403
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,599
you know your that your throw distance

1404
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:26,799
so to speak your your kind of fall off

1405
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,599
is going to be

1406
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,240
extremely severe um when you switch from

1407
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,880
an hps to an led whereas

1408
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,598
you know we could have an hps above two

1409
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,760
maybe even

1410
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,039
three beds and they'd all get about the

1411
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,040
same par

1412
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:43,279
but the second you put let's say for

1413
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,440
example that's an led fitting

1414
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,400
above that middle bed by the time you

1415
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,159
got halfway

1416
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,318
between the bed to the left and to the

1417
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,799
right it was getting almost no light

1418
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,838
so it's just something to keep an eye on

1419
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,839
if this you know is

1420
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,920
something someone's considering you know

1421
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,599
you you may need to up the amount of

1422
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,920
lights

1423
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,519
per square foot to make sure you

1424
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,079
compensate for that you know you're

1425
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,960
going from a wide angle to a very narrow

1426
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,240
zoomed

1427
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,159
kind of a lighting profile

1428
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,279
yeah can i just say that i think every

1429
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,920
commercial facility

1430
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,760
should have a par beater it's you know

1431
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,200
it's like 250 bucks

1432
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,880
i mean shoot we have them on the website

1433
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:22,159
they're not that expensive relatively

1434
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,838
speaking to what you're spending on your

1435
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,920
crop i mean

1436
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,199
i know they're certainly not expensive

1437
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,880
relative to the lights you're going to

1438
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,558
be buying if that's the plan so yeah and

1439
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,880
i been to facilities where

1440
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,599
their lights were either too far away or

1441
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,119
too close

1442
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,559
and they didn't have a par meter and

1443
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,480
they weren't really missing out on

1444
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,760
you know their an entire crop cycle

1445
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,480
where they were either

1446
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,440
under or massively over uh lighting

1447
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,079
their plants

1448
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,838
so yeah you know even if you borrow or

1449
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,839
rent one from a buddy for a little while

1450
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:53,519
uh or keep one amongst a group of people

1451
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:54,960
so you can at least figure out what that

1452
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,199
level is with your lights in your

1453
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,039
facility i think is super important

1454
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,799
and again it's it's not complicated

1455
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,239
stuff right it's just you put you turn

1456
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,680
this thing on you hold a little sensor

1457
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,959
under the light i had mine

1458
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,558
glued to a meter stick or not glued but

1459
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,639
you know taped to a meter stick so i

1460
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,319
knew exactly what the distance from the

1461
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,639
floor was

1462
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,800
at canopy height or you know what i mean

1463
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,400
so i could actually get well

1464
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,160
you know i could get two things like i

1465
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,440
would know the distance from the floor

1466
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:22,879
to the light and then i would know the

1467
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,480
distance from the floor

1468
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,240
to the top of the canopy you know i've

1469
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,760
subtracted those distances then i have

1470
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:28,879
the distance from the light to the top

1471
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,640
of the canopy

1472
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,000
and i could look at par in those you

1473
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:32,960
know that kind of curve and see well

1474
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,318
look you know

1475
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,318
if we get this close we're going to be

1476
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,400
into a danger zone here and if we get

1477
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:40,079
this far away then we're really not even

1478
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,000
maximizing the benefit of using these

1479
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,760
things at all so there is that kind of

1480
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,039
sweet spot or goldilocks owners a lot of

1481
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,559
folks like to say

1482
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:50,880
um but again the only way to find that

1483
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,599
is to just collect the data use the par

1484
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,640
meter

1485
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,359
get it get a you know measuring taper

1486
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,159
even a pvc that's a known distance right

1487
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,078
just cut a six foot long piece of pvc

1488
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,239
and there's your measuring stick you

1489
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,760
know there's ways to do things

1490
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,558
that are really not complicated and the

1491
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,400
data is extremely powerful

1492
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,760
so i'm looking at a chart here i'm

1493
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,240
looking at a couple charts that you sent

1494
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,760
me

1495
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,318
that are pretty interesting one of which

1496
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,160
i published on our instagram recently

1497
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,558
uh going back to looks like january of

1498
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:24,239
2019

1499
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:27,359
to july of 2020 you're showing

1500
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,078
an over a 300 percent increase in wet

1501
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:29,920
weight

1502
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,440
uh if i'm doing the math correctly here

1503
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,838
in my head

1504
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,519
yeah the it is a three hundred percent

1505
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:36,480
increase if you're looking at our lowest

1506
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,280
harvest

1507
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,719
to what our highest harvest is now um

1508
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,160
but from 2019

1509
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,239
to currently and i just checked the

1510
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:47,358
numbers for august we're actually up uh

1511
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,039
57 percent um on average um

1512
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:52,159
for our harvest weights which is uh

1513
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:54,318
which is pretty great wow okay

1514
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:55,440
um that's that's amazing though and

1515
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:59,039
you've done this with

1516
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,880
uh you know less labor

1517
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,719
uh because of the because of the blue

1518
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,440
mat system that you set up

1519
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,199
and improved essentially improved sop so

1520
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,039
then as you guys make a change these

1521
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,039
things get added into your sops

1522
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,039
and then you move forward to answer the

1523
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,679
next question is that right yeah

1524
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,079
exactly and everybody gets trained up

1525
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,279
and

1526
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,240
and is encouraged to think of other

1527
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,240
questions right

1528
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,679
you know again i'm not in the flower

1529
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,679
rooms every day

1530
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,039
these guys are they're with the flowers

1531
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,399
they're you know they're with the plants

1532
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,318
they're with the soil they're with the

1533
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,000
blue master with the lights

1534
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,400
they're seeing things you know they're

1535
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,480
again the fishermen of

1536
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,079
of the sea they're the the gardeners in

1537
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
the garden they're the ones there every

1538
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,240
day

1539
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,000
and their observations which again

1540
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,318
is the nucleus for the scientific

1541
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,519
process are invaluable

1542
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:52,880
so really encouraging uh growers or

1543
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:56,639
even volunteers whoever is in any

1544
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:00,480
kind of capacity working at any facility

1545
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:03,598
to openly observe and ask questions

1546
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:06,318
that's that right there is again

1547
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,000
invaluable in this whole in starting

1548
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,318
this whole process of making things

1549
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,639
better over time

1550
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,558
now not every experiment you guys ran

1551
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,078
was a success

1552
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,319
right it's some of them never even

1553
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,119
completed i know

1554
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,558
i i i try and vet people for before i

1555
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,480
send them to you guys

1556
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,079
because i know the time and expense that

1557
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,838
goes into running a trial

1558
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,559
but a couple years ago there was a

1559
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,599
particular microbial product that they

1560
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,400
had

1561
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,160
they had uh sourced out of i think the

1562
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,960
vents of yellowstone originally this

1563
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:38,799
particular

1564
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,559
archaea bacteria that was supposed to be

1565
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,720
really successful

1566
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,680
at surviving and cycling certain

1567
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,199
nutrients

1568
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,879
and i had a wonderful talk with their

1569
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,960
scientists i know they

1570
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,160
they came down and sprayed some of your

1571
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,358
plants

1572
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:56,879
um the ex the experiment kind of fell

1573
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,400
apart due to uh timing and availability

1574
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,760
because they wanted to be the ones doing

1575
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,519
the applications and they could only

1576
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,599
make it down certain times but

1577
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:06,079
um i don't believe you guys noticed

1578
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,480
anything statistically significant

1579
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,920
either we did not no we didn't it was a

1580
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,519
biotech company i can't remember the

1581
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,559
name of it but they

1582
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,920
call them out anyway they came down and

1583
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,519
it was great to work with them though

1584
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,200
they came down and they were

1585
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,639
looking to see if this treatment there

1586
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,279
this product that they had

1587
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,960
was going to be you know effective with

1588
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,280
cannabis growing and

1589
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,400
um we worked worked alongside them in

1590
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,800
our bedrooms and

1591
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,920
our flower rooms and it just never

1592
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,760
really

1593
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,159
it never really developed to the point

1594
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,599
where we saw any significant difference

1595
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:39,279
or non-significant difference at that

1596
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,079
point really we didn't we didn't get to

1597
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,000
the

1598
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,079
the methodology didn't work out in such

1599
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,318
a way like you said where the

1600
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,880
simply the logistics of having them come

1601
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:51,119
down and take data or have me

1602
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,240
take the data that they needed the the

1603
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,318
the

1604
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,399
it just didn't line up and and it just

1605
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:58,719
kind of fizzled out

1606
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,240
but you know prior to that um and if you

1607
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:01,519
want to hear my thoughts around and

1608
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,358
suzanne's thoughts

1609
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,480
check out the podcast about evaluating a

1610
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:05,759
product because those are the things you

1611
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,358
should go into before you're ever

1612
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,720
considering

1613
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,639
bringing something in your facility in

1614
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:12,639
my opinion um

1615
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,400
the id the idea that like what they were

1616
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,400
saying to us regarding the product

1617
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,720
and what it they believed it would do

1618
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,160
was were pretty astounding really

1619
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,919
and they had some science they weren't

1620
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:22,798
like just a bunch of guys that were

1621
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,639
salesmen they had

1622
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,239
they had some good scientific background

1623
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:26,798
but again it just didn't it didn't pan

1624
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,159
out

1625
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,318
in this case and that's not to say it's

1626
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,679
a bad product or a bad company

1627
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,400
but it allowed gold leaf to make a

1628
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,000
decision

1629
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,599
about whether or not it was something

1630
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,559
that they wanted to use in the facility

1631
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,318
and allowed

1632
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,440
me at kiss organics to make a decision

1633
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:42,400
of whether it was a product that we

1634
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,240
wanted to offer

1635
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,480
to our you know our customers so

1636
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:50,479
not every not every test is successful

1637
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,480
and even the unsuccessful ones will

1638
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,679
teach you something and you can't spend

1639
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,000
all day

1640
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,000
measuring everything so that's where

1641
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,519
it's really important to dial in on what

1642
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,798
it is you want to measure

1643
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,880
how you're going to measure it and

1644
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:06,719
just collect the information that you

1645
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,680
need to make a good decision for your

1646
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,480
facilities

1647
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:11,519
exactly and speaking to that one of my

1648
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,159
favorite tools

1649
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,639
in the scientific tool chest is this

1650
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,960
thing called a graphical hypothesis

1651
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,558
and it's exactly what it sounds it's you

1652
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,760
making a hypothesis

1653
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:26,079
in a graph form right so

1654
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,280
uh for example if you're comparing two

1655
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,760
treatments

1656
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,960
that would be like a bar graph right we

1657
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,000
have treatment

1658
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,960
a and versus treatment b and then you

1659
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,960
would say

1660
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,480
after come harvest a would look like

1661
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,240
this a little bit higher and b would

1662
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,039
look like this a little bit lower

1663
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:43,838
and that right there is such a north

1664
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,519
star

1665
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:47,039
because it tells you everything you need

1666
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:48,719
to know uh

1667
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,719
what kind of data do i need to collect

1668
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,798
how much data do i need to collect how

1669
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,919
often do i need to collect it

1670
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:58,239
all of those things will

1671
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,318
ultimately need to be addressed to get

1672
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:01,759
you to that graph that you just made

1673
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,798
before you even

1674
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,520
spent a dime or committed any of your

1675
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,838
facility to doing this kind of a test

1676
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:11,199
um if you wanted to look at something

1677
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,838
over time you know

1678
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,480
yield over time for example you know on

1679
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,400
the x-axis or the horizontal axis that's

1680
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,838
always going to be time

1681
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,599
your your dependent variable and on the

1682
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,039
y-axis is your i'm sorry your

1683
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,680
independent variable is on the x and

1684
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:27,119
your y

1685
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,598
is your dependent variable so what

1686
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,838
you're the response you're measuring

1687
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,798
is going to depend on time it always

1688
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,920
does

1689
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:38,798
so yield over time

1690
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,159
or anything else that goes over time you

1691
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,880
could set these graphs

1692
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:45,199
up and literally what i used to do i

1693
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,119
would just pin it to my wall

1694
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,358
and i would look at that every day and

1695
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,400
say okay what do i need to do

1696
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,598
to get to this graph now of course

1697
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,599
you know what you're doing is a

1698
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,200
hypothesis it's completely hypothetical

1699
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,519
but the framework of it

1700
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,960
is very real so the data the line what

1701
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:02,798
the line looks like

1702
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,559
what the bars look like with the scatter

1703
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:05,920
plot looks like what the heat map looks

1704
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,480
like any of these other

1705
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,000
crazy analyses you can get into that's

1706
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,559
gonna change because that's gonna

1707
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,400
actually be

1708
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:17,440
real data but the way it's set up

1709
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,838
the axes the scale maybe

1710
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,280
um certainly the units is a big one you

1711
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:22,798
need to think about am i looking at

1712
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,079
grams i'm looking at kilograms i'm

1713
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,119
looking at pounds am i looking at

1714
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,960
gallons

1715
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:32,400
cubic feet all of these little things

1716
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,720
have messed up a lot of very

1717
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,960
expensive experiments in the past not

1718
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:39,279
from us but just in science in general

1719
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,960
like just these little overlooks and the

1720
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,319
more time you can think

1721
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:47,519
and plan and ask questions and refine

1722
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,440
before you take that first step

1723
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,199
the better your data is going to be the

1724
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,639
cheaper it's going to cost you to run it

1725
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,798
because you're going to be avoiding all

1726
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,279
of these pitfalls already

1727
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,880
and you're just going to have a a really

1728
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,079
a fun time doing it

1729
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,838
it's like it's exciting right and to not

1730
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,200
know something and then know a way to

1731
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,279
figure out

1732
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:10,879
you know to go back to my other example

1733
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,880
how to get that light bulb back on

1734
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,318
yeah one of the things you touched on

1735
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:15,599
there is confounding variables so

1736
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:17,599
one of the questions you're asking

1737
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,960
yourself is what what could screw up

1738
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,760
this experiment

1739
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,519
what am i able to control for so are the

1740
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,040
lights going to be the same is the soil

1741
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,838
going to be the same because like

1742
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,480
in this case with living soil well shoot

1743
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:30,400
there's

1744
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,480
there's no way we can measure there's a

1745
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,920
black box yeah yeah i mean i guess we

1746
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,480
could get a soil test

1747
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,838
but we've i've already done podcasts

1748
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,159
talking about how

1749
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:41,358
variable and accurate those right you

1750
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,000
know let's just say

1751
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:46,078
we you know we want to measure this what

1752
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,760
we're saying when we take living soils

1753
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,039
for example in the trials that you ran

1754
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,559
we're saying that that's

1755
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,279
that's our control our control is

1756
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:56,160
whatever that soil is at right now today

1757
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,839
and we're not measuring that necessarily

1758
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:01,759
but we're keeping that the same

1759
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:02,880
across the trial itself

1760
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,480
and you're going to be making a little

1761
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,119
bit of an assumption right you're going

1762
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,000
to assume that because you have not done

1763
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,318
anything different to the soil in bed a

1764
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,159
versus the soil invest in in bed b they

1765
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,519
get the same nutrients they get the same

1766
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,798
amount of nutrients to get the same

1767
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,480
ratios

1768
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,480
whether or not the communities are the

1769
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,199
same or not again you're going back to a

1770
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,240
six-year

1771
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:27,279
phd type project but

1772
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,199
if you do everything you can to say

1773
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,359
we haven't changed this variable the

1774
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,358
soil is the soil is consistent across

1775
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:35,039
the treatment because it's gotten

1776
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:37,358
now especially with blue mats now it's

1777
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:39,838
being held at the same m bar

1778
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:40,719
uh of water it's getting the same

1779
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:42,880
amendments

1780
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,239
um they're getting you know added the

1781
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,559
same mix the same

1782
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:47,759
the bet is getting treated identical

1783
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,599
we're going to assume that those

1784
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,920
communities are the same

1785
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,798
that's okay to do because again like you

1786
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,920
said

1787
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,639
to find out how much different um that

1788
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,280
would be

1789
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,960
uh beta diversity the difference between

1790
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,079
two different communities

1791
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,199
um you're going to be looking at i think

1792
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,839
it's beta diversity i have to look at

1793
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:07,519
that up

1794
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,400
um you're going to be looking at

1795
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:12,318
microscopes for years and it's not a

1796
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,680
very useful data you'd have to use hplc

1797
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:16,639
it's not it's not useful

1798
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:18,639
it's not useful uh what i want to add to

1799
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:22,639
that though is we can compare

1800
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:24,879
soils which actually uh we did

1801
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,239
and are currently doing right now

1802
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,318
between uh

1803
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:30,719
i guess we could call it kiss organics

1804
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:33,759
soils versus uh

1805
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:36,159
gold leaf soil which is kiss organics

1806
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,280
biochar soil that's now seven or eight

1807
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,159
years old through

1808
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,798
yeah however many cycles i was really

1809
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:45,838
excited to do this and my hypothesis

1810
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:48,559
was that we would beat

1811
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:49,440
the gold leaf soil and yields on the new

1812
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,519
soil

1813
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,039
potentially on the second crop if not on

1814
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:56,159
the first one as well

1815
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:58,000
just because i know that the soil is is

1816
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,000
old and

1817
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,159
you know i know through the years you

1818
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,719
tried a lot of stuff with gold leaf and

1819
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:05,838
amendments and inputs and my i just even

1820
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:07,838
though you guys have been doing some

1821
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:08,880
soil testing and balancing it my opinion

1822
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:11,358
was well

1823
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,480
starting over after that period of time

1824
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,078
could potentially

1825
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,199
out yield what you were doing um

1826
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,039
i you had a slightly different

1827
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,558
hypothesis which you can share and then

1828
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,160
we can share that some of you know the

1829
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,000
preliminary results yeah

1830
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,358
and what was wrong with those results

1831
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,838
but go ahead

1832
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,598
so my hypothesis and there's again

1833
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,920
there's this is just for me

1834
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,559
you know having my nose and ecology

1835
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,760
books for the past six years is um

1836
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,480
there's a couple different things

1837
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,200
happening as communities get older right

1838
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,440
so

1839
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,519
one of the common uh things to think

1840
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,280
about like a rainforest for example like

1841
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:46,318
these rainforests are viewed it is like

1842
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,440
very diverse

1843
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:51,838
kinda overarching old growth lots of

1844
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:55,440
things going on lots of species

1845
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:57,440
um and when uh

1846
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,039
that forest was young it obviously

1847
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,599
didn't look like that right

1848
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,200
trees take a long time to get super big

1849
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,440
uh in fact they take a long time

1850
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:07,118
sometimes to just recruit to the area to

1851
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,920
get super big right the community

1852
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,960
composition

1853
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,440
changes over time and that is a

1854
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,400
ecological term called succession right

1855
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,119
so

1856
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,400
you would imagine uh again another

1857
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,519
example

1858
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,400
if a lake were to dry up

1859
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,519
all of a sudden you wouldn't see a

1860
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,720
forest shoot up

1861
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:31,599
straight away it would be

1862
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:33,598
small little plants you know things that

1863
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,039
would be very good at dealing with lots

1864
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,160
of water maybe

1865
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,200
maybe things that are really good at

1866
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:41,679
dealing with crazy salinity levels

1867
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:43,759
and then as those plants establish those

1868
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:45,519
pioneer plants

1869
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,480
it'll allow for the recruitment of other

1870
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,759
plants and over time this biodiversity

1871
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,000
builds up

1872
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,000
and you get these communities that have

1873
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,239
a lot of niche space there's a lot of

1874
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,559
potential for other organisms to start

1875
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,118
to

1876
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,920
you know come in think of it like the uh

1877
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,519
you know and

1878
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,039
the new hawaiian islands that are

1879
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:06,079
getting built as we speak right

1880
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:08,319
it's just bare lava rock but the can the

1881
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,720
plants we see there

1882
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,880
first settle are wildly different than

1883
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:15,038
the ones that are there you know

1884
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,318
decades generation centuries into the

1885
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,440
future

1886
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:21,759
so my hypothesis was that we have this

1887
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,838
community that we started with

1888
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,240
um and over time i think we might have

1889
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:28,400
be

1890
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:29,759
we might be growing towards this kind of

1891
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,960
older growth

1892
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,720
rainforest quote unquote of a soil

1893
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,838
community that's

1894
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,199
much more robust the trophic chain is

1895
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,038
much more developed meaning the

1896
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,439
relationships between these

1897
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,200
communities and these organisms are much

1898
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,920
more well established

1899
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,480
the diversity could very well be higher

1900
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,119
um

1901
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,838
you're going to be having a lot more

1902
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,760
microbes

1903
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:56,480
bacteria earthworms you know a lot of

1904
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,000
different

1905
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,199
players in that arena that physically

1906
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
couldn't exist

1907
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,960
earlier on because the community just

1908
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,679
wasn't

1909
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,559
built to support that yet so that was

1910
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:11,598
one

1911
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:14,079
reason why i thought gold leaf may do

1912
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,519
just as well if not maybe even better

1913
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,839
than

1914
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,759
than the new kiss oil and when i say

1915
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,000
gold leaf again really we just mean

1916
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,839
we're just testing old gold well old

1917
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,519
kids versus nuke kiss

1918
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:30,639
um and then there's another really fun

1919
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:33,119
uh ecological term called

1920
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:33,920
or it's a hypothesis really and it's

1921
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,680
it's been

1922
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,280
tested and it's got its shares of

1923
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:40,239
criticisms and things but it's called

1924
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,760
the intermediate disturbance hypothesis

1925
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,159
and this one was put forth by an

1926
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,200
experiment that's really fun

1927
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:50,399
um if you think about um

1928
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:52,719
a rocky inner title right you've got

1929
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,200
small rocks medium rocks in these big

1930
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:57,598
boulders

1931
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,919
when a wave comes and hits the shore a

1932
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,519
small rock is going to be disturbed

1933
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,639
all the time it's a small rock it's

1934
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:06,318
going to get thrown all over the place

1935
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,679
because of that not a whole lot of

1936
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:08,239
organisms are going to want to hang out

1937
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:11,598
there

1938
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:13,038
right a boulder on the other hand when a

1939
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,359
big wave comes it's not going to go

1940
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,960
anywhere it's just going to sit there

1941
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:21,679
because of that the most dominant

1942
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,720
species that can settle there will

1943
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:24,480
likely

1944
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:25,759
out compete anything else that's trying

1945
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,519
to get a foothold

1946
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,119
so the diversity is not it's going to be

1947
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:30,559
better than

1948
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,720
you know what you have at the beginning

1949
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,880
with nothing but

1950
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:36,239
it won't be as good as what you wouldn't

1951
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,358
expect to find

1952
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:42,558
on the middle sized rock

1953
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,519
because that rock is just about right to

1954
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,079
the point where

1955
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:47,280
when a wave comes it has to be a big

1956
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,839
wave

1957
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,319
to really knock everything off and if it

1958
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,279
doesn't

1959
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:53,920
it allows for the communities to build

1960
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,640
but

1961
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,960
every now and then a wave will come and

1962
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:01,679
it'll knock everything off

1963
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,119
so what this is doing is it's allowing

1964
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:06,399
the diversity

1965
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,280
to increase to a point but gets

1966
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,920
disturbed

1967
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,880
at an intermediate hence the name of the

1968
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,000
theory

1969
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,358
at an intermediate time scale so those

1970
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,838
really good species that out competing

1971
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:19,838
and

1972
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:21,519
killing off other species they're

1973
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:24,719
getting placed in check

1974
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:28,079
by this abiotic

1975
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,118
interference right this it's going to

1976
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,640
they're just not going to be able to

1977
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,358
establish the community level that they

1978
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:33,038
would

1979
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:34,798
have they not have this perturbation

1980
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,880
this this disturbance

1981
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:39,199
so my other thinking was the reason we

1982
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,480
might see old kiss soil the gold leaf

1983
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,960
soil

1984
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,920
be a little bit better is because after

1985
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,039
every round

1986
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,798
we kind of do a reset on the soil

1987
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,799
right so you're getting this disturbance

1988
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,318
intermediately so you're getting these

1989
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:55,280
communities to build up build up build

1990
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:58,239
up and

1991
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,839
again to hypothesis here i would take a

1992
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,000
long time to figure this out

1993
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:03,119
if this was actually happening but what

1994
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,679
i uh

1995
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,119
a plausible explanation would be before

1996
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:11,440
those communities get

1997
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:14,000
so well established to the point where

1998
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,880
the you know the little microbes that

1999
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,079
are really good at

2000
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,239
let's say cycling you know phosphorus or

2001
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:22,399
something they can't get out competed

2002
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:24,238
because we reset the system before they

2003
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,358
can does that make sense

2004
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,358
that's a big explanation

2005
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,919
yeah i mean i think people might not

2006
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,439
know what you're talking about when you

2007
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,199
say you reset the system

2008
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,960
um but uh where we're we're adding a

2009
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,919
disturbance right so it's like

2010
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,600
if uh if a hurricane were to come in to

2011
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,319
that rain forest

2012
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,719
and wipe the slate clean you'd have some

2013
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,080
old growth left but you'd also then have

2014
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,079
those new settlement

2015
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:51,600
those new pioneering species come back

2016
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:53,838
up and in that case

2017
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,359
your diversity is actually much greater

2018
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,559
than what it was when it was all just

2019
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,239
old growth

2020
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,839
so it's an it's another way of

2021
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,879
increasing the biodiversity of the

2022
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:03,439
community

2023
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,600
by just disturbing it in such a way that

2024
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,439
it doesn't allow the main competitors to

2025
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,640
gain a foothold

2026
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,158
yeah and you guys are running a little

2027
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,798
bit of water through there to reduce

2028
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:14,079
sodium

2029
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:17,359
and right when you amend you uh

2030
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:21,119
uh you do what people would call till

2031
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,319
i guess in terms of yeah it's very light

2032
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,079
yeah it's light but you're mixing

2033
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,960
nutrients back in so those are forms of

2034
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,000
disturbance

2035
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,679
of the soil which is exactly describing

2036
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,759
rather than running a cover crop or a

2037
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,920
mulch that doesn't allow you to

2038
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,798
to mix nutrients in homogeneously which

2039
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:40,000
is probably a whole other conversation

2040
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:41,838
but um let's talk about the results so

2041
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,279
uh what we're what can what were the

2042
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,039
results and what conclusions can we

2043
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:47,279
really draw from that sure

2044
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:48,560
so let's talk about the experimental set

2045
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,600
up real quick we had

2046
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:55,039
uh three strains we wanted to look at um

2047
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,400
we'll just call them a b and c and the

2048
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:02,319
we then had uh eight plants

2049
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,399
in each bed and we had three different

2050
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:05,920
treatments we had the old kids oil which

2051
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:08,158
is technically the control right it's

2052
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,840
what gold leaf is typically always is is

2053
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:13,198
always growing in

2054
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:16,319
um we have test then we tested that

2055
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,399
versus the biochar soil mix

2056
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,639
and we tested those two against the

2057
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:24,639
commercial growers mix

2058
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,719
so um we had nine beds in total

2059
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,079
for this trial right three strains three

2060
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,198
beds apiece

2061
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:35,760
and we took it upon ourselves to

2062
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:39,119
measure the uh wet weight and dry weight

2063
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,880
um of each plant individually right so

2064
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:42,960
again i wanted to make sure we had some

2065
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,719
statistical power here

2066
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,640
um to get at it to try to pick up any

2067
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,760
signal we possibly could so

2068
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:54,640
instead of having three

2069
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,039
data points with that were the average

2070
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,440
of

2071
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,479
eight or the sum the summation of eight

2072
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:00,799
plants

2073
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:03,359
i cut each individual plant out of there

2074
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,679
and measured and measured individually

2075
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,198
and uh what we're seeing so far again

2076
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,960
it's a super preliminary i haven't even

2077
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,359
ran the stats on it yet but we are

2078
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,079
seeing that the older soil

2079
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,559
is outperforming biochar and commercial

2080
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,640
growers

2081
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:21,920
new soil um

2082
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,520
so far is it is it statistically

2083
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,920
significant at this point

2084
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,800
i don't know yet i'm looking at the

2085
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,319
variation

2086
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:33,279
i can't imagine it is um there's

2087
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,599
quite a bit of variation in the plant so

2088
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:36,800
like

2089
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,320
for example for strain a uh you'll get a

2090
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,640
plant that weighs

2091
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,399
you know three six pounds but you'll

2092
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,600
also get a plant in that same bed that

2093
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,559
will weigh

2094
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,320
uh 2.1 pounds right so there's a lot of

2095
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,159
fluctuation in the data

2096
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:52,479
and what you have big variation like

2097
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:55,679
that it's really hard to

2098
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:58,559
test and resend and find significance

2099
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,279
unless you go with a lot of data points

2100
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,000
um

2101
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,279
so we are seeing a little bit better

2102
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,079
yields coming out of

2103
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:07,279
of the oldest soil or oldest kiss soil

2104
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:10,719
we're testing

2105
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:13,439
um that being said

2106
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,480
it's not like the biochar and the

2107
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:18,399
commercial growers

2108
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:20,158
both of those soils hit the average

2109
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:22,079
uh or just about hit the average

2110
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:24,559
sometimes surpass the average of what

2111
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:27,439
the gold leaf soil was producing

2112
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,960
so we're not talking about extremely

2113
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,599
large jumps here

2114
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,039
um so another way of saying that is

2115
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,480
let's say a gold leaf

2116
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:39,519
plant weighed uh you know 1.2 pounds

2117
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:42,238
um we've seen both commercial growers

2118
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,600
and biochar also have plants that

2119
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:46,319
weighed that much

2120
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,280
so there's you know there's some

2121
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,279
variability where

2122
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,039
we we just harvested another room that

2123
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,519
we ran the same trial in

2124
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,880
so we're trying to again start looking

2125
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,920
for patterns

2126
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,600
um and crossing off some some controls

2127
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,960
right was it just that room this time

2128
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,159
where that happened was it just these

2129
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,560
strains

2130
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:06,319
um so we're repeating some strains we're

2131
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,840
adding some new strains to see if we can

2132
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,000
find that signal

2133
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,079
and all this kind of background noise of

2134
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,119
uh of all this data but

2135
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:18,158
um it looks like if you take good

2136
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:19,920
care of kiss soil uh it only it's like a

2137
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,599
fine wine it only gets better with each

2138
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,880
well yeah this doesn't hurt my feelings

2139
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,440
because at the end of the day we want

2140
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,840
people

2141
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:26,559
to reuse oil and we want to know that

2142
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,760
the soil

2143
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,880
is still viable in this case seven or

2144
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,079
eight years later which is

2145
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,640
phenomenal the amount of savings on

2146
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,319
you know buying soil over that time it's

2147
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,520
you know paid for itself but

2148
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:43,039
uh what's what's funny to me in this and

2149
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,199
you kind of shared this with me after

2150
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:48,479
giving me the numbers was

2151
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:51,039
uh the beds i guess uh were not

2152
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,718
the equal volume of soil if i if i

2153
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:55,198
remember correctly so

2154
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,719
uh we can't draw every conclusion from

2155
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,039
this knowing not all of them

2156
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,800
you said that the kiss soil beds uh some

2157
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,920
of them were lower had lower volume of

2158
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,039
soil than the

2159
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,880
soil exactly well that's not fair that

2160
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:08,800
would be a confounding variable so

2161
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,719
it absolutely would so we this next

2162
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,400
child that we're we're doing now we just

2163
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,319
transplanted we we grabbed some more

2164
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:15,920
soil and we we measured it out and we're

2165
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:18,799
controlling now for

2166
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,760
soil depth um to make sure that that

2167
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,440
can't not that

2168
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:25,119
that is eliminated as a confounding

2169
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:27,279
variable that may impact the results

2170
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,238
which is great but what what i would

2171
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:30,960
love to say

2172
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:32,319
in all of this in terms of uh what

2173
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,480
conclusions we can draw

2174
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,238
one thing you know that we could look at

2175
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:36,959
here just by measuring wet weight dry

2176
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,359
weight

2177
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,039
is that uh you guys don't need to

2178
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:43,599
replace your soil it's not

2179
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,679
at the moment a limiting factor of

2180
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:49,199
growth assuming that we're setting

2181
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:52,399
you know new soil from kiss

2182
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:53,039
as the control in that case you know

2183
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:55,920
you're still

2184
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:57,359
performing at or above that level which

2185
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,039
exactly which is great so

2186
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,479
this would allow you to make a decision

2187
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:02,479
okay do i need to

2188
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,158
do i need to reset the soil or are we

2189
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:05,919
good to keep using the soil which saves

2190
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:09,198
a ton of money for

2191
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:12,158
gold leaf and cost kiss some money but

2192
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,759
i'm okay with that i think it's great

2193
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:15,599
from a just from a sustainability

2194
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,960
standpoint to to not even have to worry

2195
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,800
about you know things like nutrient

2196
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,480
runoff and just

2197
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,159
it's just a bet it's just a more

2198
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,519
holistic way of of gardening whether

2199
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:24,319
you're doing cannabis or anything else

2200
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,679
is

2201
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:27,599
you know just to keep reusing your

2202
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,199
medium it's it's it's it's a great

2203
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,480
feeling to not think that you're just

2204
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:32,479
turning through something that

2205
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,919
you know if you you know take care of it

2206
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:37,599
it'll it'll keep you

2207
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:40,000
fed and and among other things

2208
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,079
for a long time yeah and i think folks

2209
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,158
can do this across different soil

2210
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,439
recipes and soil brands like it's not

2211
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:47,679
just about obviously

2212
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,359
my company or our soil you know you

2213
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,960
could compare different companies soil

2214
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:52,639
or different recipes of soil or

2215
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,319
different ways of reamending your soil

2216
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,280
those are all things that any facility

2217
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:57,439
could look at

2218
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:59,359
and draw decisions on where people get

2219
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:01,198
in trouble in my opinion

2220
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:04,000
is where they start making a whole bunch

2221
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:05,678
of changes all at once like people

2222
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,880
i get this question all the time like

2223
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,239
what should i add to the soil to

2224
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,000
maximize my yield

2225
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:11,759
and i usually tell people unless they're

2226
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,198
in like a five or seven gallon pot in

2227
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,560
which case i say you may have to add

2228
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,599
nutrients or you may want to

2229
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,120
you know um add more you know consider a

2230
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,079
larger container depending on your crop

2231
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:23,760
cycle but

2232
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,679
in general my answer every time is just

2233
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,880
go with one pot with just water or one

2234
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,640
container or one

2235
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,319
bed whatever it is and just so you get

2236
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,719
an idea of how

2237
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,359
the soil performs as a control now

2238
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,719
exactly

2239
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:36,000
if you want to start adding in other

2240
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,880
things you know we didn't even talk

2241
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,880
about mammoth p

2242
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,760
in that trial we should probably touch

2243
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:45,119
on that real quick before we sign off

2244
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:47,440
as well but uh basically

2245
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,158
we have to have an understanding if you

2246
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:49,439
start adding

2247
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:51,519
all these different things all these

2248
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,719
inputs into the soil and then the soil

2249
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,480
does really well

2250
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,840
great but now you're locked in doing all

2251
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,439
these inputs and not really knowing what

2252
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,560
the controlling variable was

2253
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:01,519
or in a worst-case scenario the soil

2254
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,239
totally fails you

2255
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,600
and your plant looks terrible um you

2256
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,599
don't know if it was if you can blame

2257
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,719
the soil company or if you can blame

2258
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,520
your water or the 50 other things that

2259
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,880
you did

2260
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:17,600
to the soil uh during the crop cycle so

2261
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,400
yeah exactly so again going back to the

2262
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,560
simple

2263
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,238
your burnt out light bulb example it'd

2264
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,239
be synonymous to saying okay i'm gonna

2265
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:25,919
replace the switch the wiring the light

2266
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:27,839
bulb the light fixture

2267
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,039
all at the same time before i try it

2268
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,239
again

2269
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:33,198
right so you you can't address

2270
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,079
everything

2271
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:37,678
at once i mean you can but you have to

2272
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:39,119
pretty much devote all of your facility

2273
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,359
and probably a couple more

2274
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,279
to answer all the questions individually

2275
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:45,920
that you need to have a time

2276
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:47,198
but it's just one thing at a time and

2277
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,319
again

2278
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:52,000
things are always you know not to

2279
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,479
drop the name of the company but keeping

2280
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,600
it simple really is the way to go

2281
01:17:54,479 --> 01:18:00,079
because if something goes wrong

2282
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,840
you know what you did as opposed to well

2283
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:03,119
i change this this this and this and

2284
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,920
then you're gonna have to go back and

2285
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:08,319
say well was it this this this or this

2286
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,359
or if something goes great and you want

2287
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:12,399
to replicate that

2288
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:15,039
well you need to know what you did

2289
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:15,759
um that actually caused that change like

2290
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,840
you were saying

2291
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,119
like you might be adding if you added

2292
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,039
five things into the soil

2293
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:22,399
your plants shot up like rockets that's

2294
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:22,800
incredible that's what we're all looking

2295
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:24,319
for

2296
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,279
but what if four of those were a total

2297
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:28,559
waste of time and money

2298
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:29,840
yeah we have to look at that and one

2299
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,120
other confounding variable that we

2300
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,480
didn't talk about but people need to

2301
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:34,640
consider is pests

2302
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:35,759
so if you have root aphids come in on a

2303
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,400
crop cycle

2304
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,880
uh you know for just as or the cannabis

2305
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:40,559
aphid

2306
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,480
that's going to affect your numbers that

2307
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,400
really in a lot of ways challenges or

2308
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:46,479
ruins and experiments so

2309
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:47,920
just keep all of those things in the

2310
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:48,639
back of your head as you're setting up

2311
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,640
an experiment

2312
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,000
and uh i haven't talked to ben about

2313
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,000
this but i'm gonna throw this out on the

2314
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,760
air here

2315
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,359
if you are a commercial facility and you

2316
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,239
want help setting up a trial

2317
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:01,920
in in one of our soils or something um

2318
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:03,198
reach out to us and we'll help you with

2319
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,600
the methodology

2320
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:06,879
absolutely and and you know make sure

2321
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,079
you guys are on the right track so you

2322
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,000
can start testing things because the

2323
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:13,439
more data points we can collect

2324
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,439
uh as an industry uh the better you know

2325
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:17,119
and exactly and and that's what i really

2326
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:18,960
hope like i said folks take away from

2327
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,920
this is if we get everybody to be just

2328
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,960
more confident

2329
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,640
and and in collecting their own data

2330
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,800
short i'm not expecting everyone to

2331
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,800
start doing crazy statistical analyses

2332
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,840
and looking for significance in p values

2333
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,239
enough values and t

2334
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,679
tests and all these crazy things that

2335
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:36,399
you know you get to

2336
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,199
learn eventually but simply just looking

2337
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:39,198
at how much

2338
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:41,759
something adds up or the average of

2339
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:45,039
something is incredibly informative

2340
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:48,320
and you know if there's a

2341
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:52,079
big decision you need to make

2342
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:55,599
doing it slowly and trying it first

2343
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:58,719
is always going to save you money

2344
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:01,679
because you're just not taking the risk

2345
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,359
um so yeah if i could just just get

2346
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,760
everybody more confident and

2347
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:06,479
and and and have fun with it you know

2348
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,239
that's

2349
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,000
it's investigation that's how does this

2350
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:12,079
happen you know it's cause and effect

2351
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,119
it's it's one of our basic inquiries is

2352
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:16,079
human beings why is this this way um and

2353
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,198
you can do that

2354
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:20,639
um for growing every day

2355
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,119
yeah i know i know we talked about the

2356
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:25,359
mammoth p trial that you guys ran

2357
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:27,039
uh on the last podcast i did with you do

2358
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:28,238
you just happen to know the percentage

2359
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,399
of yield increase oh

2360
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:31,359
shoot i'd have to look that up i can i

2361
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:33,359
can i can

2362
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,639
post that or we can post that once i

2363
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:36,639
look that up again

2364
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:38,000
i i want to say we were somewhere in the

2365
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:41,600
twenty percent

2366
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,600
range somewhere in there um like

2367
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,000
maybe a little bit less fifteen twenty

2368
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,600
percent i have to look to get the number

2369
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,439
exactly but i just don't have it in

2370
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,800
front of me okay and again this was

2371
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:52,719
in your you know what we're calling

2372
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,960
goldleaf soil which is

2373
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:57,039
older soil living soil that's been

2374
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,319
managed uh

2375
01:20:57,039 --> 01:20:59,600
these are the yields you saw in your

2376
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:01,279
facility that's not to say you can

2377
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,440
expect that across the board but

2378
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:04,880
to me that if i heard this and looked at

2379
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,559
your methodology and it looked somewhat

2380
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,840
sound i would say okay this is worth

2381
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,960
trying out

2382
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,000
in my facility to see if i can get

2383
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,639
similar results

2384
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,880
and if i do then it's worth a cost

2385
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:19,199
benefit analysis to

2386
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,560
make that addition so those are the kind

2387
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:21,119
of things i look for when i start

2388
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,960
reading

2389
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:24,238
about the research or results that other

2390
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,319
people are getting um

2391
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:27,599
yeah and again it's like you said it's

2392
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:28,079
extremely important to remember that

2393
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,480
this is

2394
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,880
obviously no matter what i say or

2395
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:34,879
anybody else says it's a case by case

2396
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:37,679
but what's not a case by case is data

2397
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,920
collection right i keep harping on this

2398
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,920
if you want to know something measuring

2399
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,119
something is synonymous across the board

2400
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,920
with everything and that's what's going

2401
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:46,158
to tell you

2402
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,840
if somebody else's system or somebody

2403
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:48,960
else's product or somebody else's

2404
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,079
suggestion

2405
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:56,239
will work for you and your facility

2406
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:59,279
your your employees your workflows

2407
01:21:56,238 --> 01:22:01,439
your sops all of that will be

2408
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:04,079
determined or can be determined by just

2409
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:06,079
collecting the data

2410
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,840
so what trials do we have to look

2411
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:10,880
forward to from you

2412
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,960
uh in the future here with gold leaf i

2413
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,960
know a couple off the top of my head

2414
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,000
that i'm looking forward to to trialing

2415
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,439
but what uh

2416
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,198
anything that you're excited about right

2417
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:21,039
now um

2418
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:23,119
i we've got another couple products we

2419
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:24,479
want to look at um again like i said we

2420
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:28,880
want to start dialing in

2421
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:31,519
the the leds a little bit better um

2422
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,960
there's a couple of different uh soil

2423
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,280
mixes we might be working on in the

2424
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:38,239
future here that we want to test

2425
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:38,880
um and and really just making trying to

2426
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:42,479
keep that

2427
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:44,480
that that line on the increase

2428
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:45,799
yeah on the soil mix side i know you and

2429
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,678
i are talking about some more

2430
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:50,800
sustainable

2431
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:52,960
yeah options down the road

2432
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,119
to move towards things that are more

2433
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,600
sustainably produced potentially

2434
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:58,880
which i'm really excited about there's a

2435
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,719
microbial product

2436
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,639
that i haven't told you about yet that

2437
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,639
i'm excited to uh

2438
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,880
potentially do some trials on we're

2439
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:08,800
looking at things around heavy metals

2440
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:12,239
right now and heavy metal uptake and how

2441
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:14,000
do we how do we reduce or

2442
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,519
with a lot more confidence guarantee

2443
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,198
based on the testing that people

2444
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,320
are dealing with right now that that

2445
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:19,678
they're not going to fail for heavy

2446
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:22,719
metals

2447
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:23,520
and what inputs are most affecting those

2448
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,639
results

2449
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,639
which is really interesting

2450
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,679
i'm trying to think what else off the

2451
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,319
top my head i know one of the

2452
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,319
experiments i'm super excited to try

2453
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:35,840
once i finish remodeling my garage and

2454
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,599
get a legal

2455
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:43,199
certificate with uh with the state

2456
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:47,520
so i can grow legally again at my place

2457
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:50,799
is i want to show a trial of just

2458
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,440
plants with the same same genetics

2459
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,000
same soil just water to different m bars

2460
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:56,079
because

2461
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,439
i don't think people realize how

2462
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:59,359
important water is so i want to take a

2463
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:02,238
blue mat system and set one up

2464
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,198
at 40 mbar one at sixty one at eighty

2465
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:04,319
one at a hundred

2466
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:05,519
you know all the way through to like

2467
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:07,359
let's say a hundred and eighty two

2468
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,760
hundred two hundred mbar

2469
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:11,839
and just show people how much just

2470
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,480
hydrology just watering

2471
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,920
can affect the health and growth of a

2472
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:16,799
plant because so many times people will

2473
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,560
post these

2474
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,639
pictures of plants you know with

2475
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,920
deficiencies or toxicities all these

2476
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,760
things and and

2477
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,679
i feel like a lot of the times it's just

2478
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,679
watering so yeah

2479
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,520
right it's it's in it you know if you

2480
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,239
are working with living soil like we all

2481
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,600
love to do it's it's it's really easy to

2482
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:35,039
think about well you have

2483
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,800
these different components and this

2484
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:37,439
makes my plant grow right you have your

2485
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,960
soil

2486
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:41,039
you have your lighting you have your

2487
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,439
nutrients you have your irrigation

2488
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:44,079
these things make my plant grow but in

2489
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,399
reality

2490
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,760
it's all of those things working or not

2491
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:49,279
working together

2492
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,800
is what makes your plant grow or not

2493
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:54,158
grow so

2494
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,520
when you dial in one thing it's not like

2495
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,319
the other things aren't going to be

2496
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,360
impacted

2497
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,559
so trying to keep an eye on well i

2498
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:02,479
changed this

2499
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,840
but holding irrigation constant for

2500
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:05,919
example right so

2501
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,279
like you're saying if we had a trial

2502
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,760
with a bunch of different beds they're

2503
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:12,719
all being constantly held at the same

2504
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,079
embar we can confidently say the only

2505
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:17,198
thing that's changing here is

2506
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:20,559
not just here is just the irrigation

2507
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:22,479
um in such a sense that we we know that

2508
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,080
we're not getting different nutrients

2509
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:25,599
the lighting is the same the genetics

2510
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:27,840
are the same um

2511
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,520
the only thing different and it would be

2512
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,719
really cool at the end of the day

2513
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,639
now that we're talking about it you've

2514
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,198
got my wheels spinning

2515
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,800
um you know to actually see if we can

2516
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,599
get a tissue test

2517
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,000
and a soil test to see what's getting

2518
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,639
pulled

2519
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,520
out of that soil relative to the

2520
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,400
different

2521
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,199
um soil moisture that that plant was

2522
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:49,439
exposed to

2523
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:50,238
right so one hypothesis would be if

2524
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:54,879
you're

2525
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:57,759
sitting at 200 mbar the the

2526
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,719
nutrient and elemental makeup of that

2527
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,039
plant

2528
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,719
is going to look different than a plant

2529
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,679
that was grown at 100 mbar even though

2530
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:08,399
they had access to the exact same medium

2531
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:10,079
sure that that makes perfect sense um

2532
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:12,399
it's funny because i'll see soil tests

2533
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:12,800
from clients sometimes and i can usually

2534
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:14,559
tell

2535
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,800
if they're using our soil if they had a

2536
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,679
flood event at one point in time during

2537
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,840
their cycle

2538
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:22,158
just based on how the test looks or i

2539
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,719
can tell if their water is

2540
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:26,000
you know really high in calcium or the

2541
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,560
ph is high on it

2542
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,039
these are all things that are usually

2543
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,159
pretty

2544
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:35,119
easy to spot from a soil test just based

2545
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,638
on that like like you're mentioning so

2546
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:38,800
yeah it'll be fun to set that up as an

2547
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,159
experiment uh as a visual

2548
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,840
kind of for people to see what that

2549
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:44,479
looks like um

2550
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,079
yeah and i look forward to future

2551
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:47,039
research and i look forward to seeing

2552
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:48,479
what other research

2553
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:50,158
other people are doing out there too

2554
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:51,678
because you know there's a lot of

2555
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:53,039
cannabis research being done right now

2556
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,319
and i'm hoping more and more people will

2557
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,920
share it so if you're

2558
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:57,679
listening this and you're uh you're a

2559
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,960
grad student or

2560
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:02,560
you know a professor by chance or

2561
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,000
even a facility that feels like they

2562
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,080
have a good handle on scientific

2563
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,760
method uh and you're getting results

2564
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:08,960
please reach out i'd love to share them

2565
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,880
on the podcast too

2566
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,480
yeah it's kind of a unique position and

2567
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,679
it's one of the exciting like rarely in

2568
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:16,238
science you and i

2569
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:18,000
again i kind of stumbled into this

2570
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:21,198
position where you find this

2571
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,279
completely untapped field

2572
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:24,719
you know just an open question now that

2573
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,238
not to being said that a lot of work

2574
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,319
hasn't been done you know obviously

2575
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:31,678
people have been growing and talking in

2576
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:33,759
for centuries um it's not longer but

2577
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:36,480
you know as far as from an academic and

2578
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:39,199
scientific standpoint than the normal

2579
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:41,119
kind of avenues to scientific

2580
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:44,559
investigation and discovery

2581
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:46,238
at least in our country has were closed

2582
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,000
up until now they're just starting to

2583
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:51,439
open right so things like

2584
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,119
government funding or uh research

2585
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:54,079
institutes like universities or colleges

2586
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:56,319
none of those things

2587
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:58,399
or which are the normal pathways for

2588
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,359
discovery were open to cannabis because

2589
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:02,000
of the federal

2590
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,279
prohibition so we really are kind of

2591
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,158
depending on

2592
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:07,679
you know facilities and and and and

2593
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:09,759
research scientists and

2594
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,239
and again growers with a ton of

2595
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:15,280
experience to all work together

2596
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:18,079
uh in kind of a almost a privatized

2597
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:19,119
uh you know collective to to really

2598
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:22,238
advance

2599
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:24,800
you know the growing of this product um

2600
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:26,399
into the future yeah and i don't think

2601
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,960
people have to be afraid to share things

2602
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,158
because

2603
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:32,399
uh at the end of the day like

2604
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:33,439
you know someone running you know

2605
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:35,439
eight-year-old soil

2606
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:36,719
with blue mats and using let's say our

2607
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:39,919
you know mammoth p or

2608
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,639
whatever whatever stuff worked for gold

2609
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,319
leaf

2610
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,679
they're still they don't have gold leafs

2611
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:44,799
branding and marketing they don't have

2612
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,480
gold leaf growers

2613
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,239
they don't have gold leaf's sops like

2614
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:50,319
there's a lot more that goes into

2615
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:53,359
running a commercial facility than just

2616
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:55,039
a few products or a soil or any of those

2617
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:56,238
things so

2618
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:57,760
i hear people say they don't want to

2619
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:58,158
share their data because they're giving

2620
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,639
away

2621
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:01,759
you know trade secrets um or things that

2622
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:03,199
are proprietary

2623
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,199
to their company but at the end of the

2624
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:06,719
day like there are instances where that

2625
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:07,198
would be true but in a lot of cases i

2626
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,480
think

2627
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:10,238
if we share this data we're just

2628
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:11,119
improving ourselves as an industry and

2629
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,119
helping

2630
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:14,960
us all be successful and potentially

2631
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:16,000
compete with big big ag here down the

2632
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,079
road is

2633
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,319
real science as some may call it we'll

2634
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,158
start coming into this uh

2635
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:24,158
into this industry as if as it already

2636
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:27,359
has been shown to start happening

2637
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:30,638
exactly yep absolutely all right ben

2638
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:32,238
well this has turned into a long podcast

2639
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:33,840

01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,719
comes on down the road for you and uh

2649

[Music]

2655
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,600
that was dr ben higgins chief research

2656
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:08,880
scientist with gold leaf gardens

2657
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,800
you are listening to the canada's

2658
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,560
cultivation and science podcast

2659
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,000
