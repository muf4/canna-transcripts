1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,240
the primary determinant of Ash color is

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:08,119
in is incomplete combustion of or of

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,240
carbon based molecules of organic

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,558
compounds and this is what Brandon

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,080
addressed really well so that's that's

6
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,759
the number one thing and I think it's

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,359
it's very likely that that's the only

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,800
thing um but Growers have come to me a

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,680
lot with say look at my sulfur this is

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,439
going to affect my my ash color and I

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,439
don't think that's accurate
