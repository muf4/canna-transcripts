1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,440
I do not think that there's a critical

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,720
growth period that's been identified in

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,960
cannabis production when calcium is

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,439
needed the most and in fact it seems to

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,679
me like it's needed throughout the

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,160
entire growth cycle so again there's

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,518
just a difference there it's not an

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,679
apple it's a cannabis plant so I

9
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:26,839
generally believe that it's especially

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,359
needed in veg I think it's critically

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,559
important

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,679
to maximize calcium uptake and veg it's

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,320
hard to overdo it in organic production

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:41,119
i' I've never seen it overdone um and so

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,759
I think the reason that that it's that

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,679
it's so important in veg is not because

17
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,198
it's a critical point of influence it's

18
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,920
just because you can't get it back once

19
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:51,718
you're at week four of flour you're not

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,679
gonna you're not going to catch up if

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,600
your calcium uptake wasn't high enough

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,479
and what I've sort of seen through years

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,439
of working with cannabis Growers is the

24
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,679
highest yielding plants have to have

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,959
enough calcium going into

26
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,879
flower and I also believe that the

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,519
lowest disease pressure and just the the

28
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,478
the best Vigor and general plant health

29
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,719
comes from sufficient calcium levels so

30
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,560
the reason I like focusing on veg is

31
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,359
because you don't you don't want to play

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,400
catchup with calcium like you mentioned

33
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,359
it's movement is in the the

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,359
transpiration stream the water going up

35
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:32,519
through the xylem and so um you just you

36
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,239
just want to maintain that that stream

37
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:40,560
of calcium throughout the entire cycle

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,560
the entire life of the plant
