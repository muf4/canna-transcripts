welcome to the cannabis cultivation in

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,769
science podcast

4
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,969
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,039
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,689
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,789
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,679
share their wisdom and knowledge my

10
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,019
podcast this week is with justin mcgill

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,420
justin is an owner and head grower for

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,739
legit farms a legal cannabis company in

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,780
the recreational market here in

14
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,549
Washington State I want to do this

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,960
podcast with Justin because he has been

16
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,429
growing in living soils longer than

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,109
anyone else I know and he was

18
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,869
instrumental in helping me in testing

19
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:54,628
out various ideas around soil mixes soil

20
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,698
testing and reom ending in beds this

21
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,280
podcast is less about the proven science

22
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,019
around concepts but more so the tips and

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,698
tricks he's picked up over the years as

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,859
he's learned from cultivating this plant

25
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,658
my hope is that will encourage other

26
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,090
growers to experiment and try out some

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,760
new ideas or offer some suggestions that

28
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,439
may spark other innovation not only that

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,150
but justin is just a great guy and a

30
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,709
good friend it was fun to catch up with

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,540
him on about what he's been learning

32
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,339
since transitioning into the rec market

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,868
and scaling some of the things he was

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,150
doing on the medical side from back in

35
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,150
the day anyway onto the podcast

36
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:34,200
hey Justin welcome to the show hey Dad

37
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,060
thanks for having me yeah I mean I've

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,950
known you for I think we were talking

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,150
about it before the show like since what

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,159
2011 2010 I met you and I mean you came

41
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,868
to my wedding we've become good friends

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,259
over the years and definitely talked a

43
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,040
lot about growing cannabis you want tell

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,759
a little bit about how we know each

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,469
other and in your background yeah you're

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,599
being really modest we discovered your

47
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:03,629
soil and then we just took off and he's

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:07,618
great success yeah I've been growing for

49
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:09,060
I think since 2003 is when I first tried

50
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:13,169
hanging a light up and sticking some

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,060
clones under it and I eventually I tried

52
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,659
a lot of method

53
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,530
eventually found myself doing just top

54
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:24,639
top feeding nutrients over cocoa and

55
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:28,159
using botanic airline and getting a

56
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,659
decent result like pretty okay quality

57
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,049
and everybody was happy with things but

58
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:34,909
my best friend Jaya he was like I know

59
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,739
you can do a lot better and I was

60
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:39,889
struggling at that point with like some

61
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:43,189
pH issues and stuff and so long story

62
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:45,708
short my buddy started getting involved

63
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:48,349
and he's got a mycology background and

64
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,390
he's just as you know he's he's pretty

65
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:53,479
darn brilliant and I had the

66
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:55,339
construction pedigree and just pure love

67
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,079
of cannabis to really motivate us to

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,259
take it to the next level so he started

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,540
getting involved and we decided to get a

70
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:05,719
house together in Seattle and that was

71
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:08,750
right around when I met you because Jaya

72
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:11,419
he told me that people are getting big

73
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,939
yields on compost based soil and just

74
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,889
adding water to it and that that was a

75
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:19,129
typical grower I pretty much laughed at

76
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:22,789
that but we had built a really nice

77
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:25,669
scene in our basement and and I think

78
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:27,798
Jaya had met you because he was doing

79
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:31,518
some compost or some research on compost

80
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,260
tea and you were like hey I just made

81
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,900
some soil you want to try it out is that

82
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:38,599
kind of how it went yeah I was literally

83
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,219
in my parents driveway rolling a compost

84
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,169
tumbler around with the first few

85
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:44,150
batches of soil I was trying out at the

86
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:47,059
time and when Jaya showed up and we kind

87
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,250
of hit it off and I sent him home with

88
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,699
some soil too because I wasn't growing

89
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,318
cannabis or anything at the time and he

90
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,988
you guys were kind of the first the

91
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:00,078
first testers of I guess what's now

92
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:06,500
turned into or become kiss soil in a lot

93
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:10,549
of ways yeah yeah so yeah Jaya took that

94
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,068
soil back to our place and I'd had a

95
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,650
strain called grapefruit for four years

96
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:17,329
that was pretty good but we'd never

97
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,389
really figured out how to grow it right

98
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,680
and we can't remember what we did I

99
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,329
think we probably stuck like seven

100
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,000
gallons of your soil or something a

101
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:28,159
smart pot and we planted grapefruit in

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,350
there and it was it was picture

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,660
a grapefruit just towered above the

104
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,000
whole crop is a big beautiful buzz

105
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,439
everywhere it was it was it was the kind

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,529
of thing where we didn't really need to

107
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,050
discuss it even it was just a matter of

108
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:45,289
wow how do we get all this soil in our

109
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,379
basement and the first thing that we did

110
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,650
was we had I can't remember if they're 5

111
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:53,329
or 7 gallon smart pause but we kept

112
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:55,339
pushing them closer and closer together

113
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,500
we built one big drain table that they

114
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,439
all sat on and we kept pushing the pots

115
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,449
closer and closer together and we could

116
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,040
clearly see that the roots were growing

117
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,620
through the smart pots into the other

118
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,420
smart pots and so when we harvest we'd

119
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,670
be ripping these things apart and that's

120
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,740
when both Jaya and I were like man we

121
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,160
just need to put some slides on this

122
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,389
thing and make a bed out of it and

123
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,030
meanwhile my little house in Arlington

124
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,919
had some grow trays that were already on

125
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,719
tables and listed up so we just threw a

126
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,580
bunch of soil in there and gave it a

127
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,070
little experiment it was not deep enough

128
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:30,349
but it worked really well and then we

129
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:33,019
put walls on our table down below in the

130
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:37,040
Seattle house and it was so productive

131
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:39,439
and it was so easy to operate and and

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,950
the quality of the bud that we were

133
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,019
growing was just amazing and we just ran

134
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,180
with it from there

135
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:49,459
so you started you started making these

136
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,490
beds and I remember when we first

137
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:54,439
started talking about this and then came

138
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,910
around with the idea of reusing the soil

139
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,189
and keeping it in the room because it is

140
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,689
a lot of Labor especially back in those

141
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:02,060
days when you're moving it out of a

142
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:05,540
basement and trying to you know at that

143
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,670
time be a little more discreet how how

144
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,050
did the whole reusing the soil go I know

145
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:14,090
there's been ups and downs throughout

146
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:16,939
that process as well yeah now that was

147
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:20,319
that was purely Jaya because he was

148
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:22,879
convinced that we could amend it with

149
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,219
the proper amendments and and get it

150
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,050
reusable again just like you would in an

151
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,290
outdoor garden or a greenhouse or

152
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,120
something like that and at the time we

153
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,920
were both kind of like man we don't know

154
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,829
why anybody isn't doing this which is

155
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,150
funny now looking back on it but yeah

156
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:41,959
pretty much we just seriously went about

157
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,599
amending the soil and

158
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,579
using it and it got to the point where

159
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,169
some of the soil we had I think there

160
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:50,359
were some soil that had gone for seven

161
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:52,639
years before we ended up replacing that

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,220
and the soil test would get really

163
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
really weird the salt levels and all

164
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,150
that like I remember you looking at soil

165
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,388
reports like wow how is this how is this

166
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:04,879
even working but we were still getting

167
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:08,598
good quality and decent rates or I'm

168
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:12,769
sorry decent yields but um as you know

169
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:14,538
eventually we we got this plant

170
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,418
parasitic nematode called the root-knot

171
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:19,639
nematode and I actually got that myself

172
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:21,948
down the road when when we had the

173
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,030
program in a lot more places really

174
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:28,580
stepped up and we were reusing soil all

175
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:30,348
the way through the system too so we

176
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:33,408
would plant we would plant a plant in

177
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:36,529
soil and veg it would go into flour into

178
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:38,478
an amended bed and then that same soil

179
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,978
that's in the flower beds as we plant

180
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,439
the next round into there the soil

181
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:44,598
displaced would go right back into our

182
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,319
bedroom right back into our propagation

183
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:50,089
space so that little closed-loop system

184
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,399
of just recycling and recycling and

185
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:55,698
recycling in my opinion that's what got

186
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:58,189
us the root-knot nematode it's also very

187
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,689
likely that we've literally caught it

188
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,209
you know that we got it from somebody

189
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:04,788
and it wasn't around before but we've

190
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:06,680
all got varying theories on it but I

191
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:09,319
kind of feel like it's something that's

192
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,810
around and if you provide the right

193
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,269
conditions and promote it enough you get

194
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:19,069
to to toxic levels as soon as you have

195
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:20,149
the toxic levels of this nematode it's

196
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,728
almost like you should just burn down

197
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:26,598
your facility it's like it is so hard to

198
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:30,949
get rid of so once that happened that

199
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:34,370
was when when I quit reusing soil in veg

200
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:37,430
so now as a bedding plant goes into a

201
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,899
flower bed that is amended soil the soil

202
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,269
that comes out of that bed that's

203
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,690
displaced by the next round coming in we

204
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:46,909
discard that now and that's to just to

205
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,399
reduce any likelihood of something

206
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:53,448
that's collecting in the amended flower

207
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,450
beds into making it back to propagation

208
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:57,958
and I use the analogy of a river

209
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,120
like propagation as the headwaters

210
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,669
bedroom is like you know the the upper

211
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,009
mainstream and the flower rooms are all

212
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:09,699
like the estuary or whatever you want to

213
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:12,698
call it and we try to at the farm really

214
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:19,540
not bring anything from downstream back

215
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:22,028
upstream and right now I I haven't done

216
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:24,069
it yet but I found a lab that will test

217
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,500
for the root-knot nematode part of the

218
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,778
trouble with that without guys all you

219
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,610
you can't see it until you see the signs

220
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:35,198
of it and once you see the signs of it

221
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:38,500
it's way too late so as you know we're

222
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:40,269
still amending your soil like crazy and

223
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,850
maybe getting a little better at it but

224
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:45,879
but we're trying to we're trying to do

225
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,350
whatever we can to to avoid promoting

226
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,698
that root-knot nematode and so I'm

227
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,909
pretty excited about having the ability

228
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:53,948
to test it and that should be able to do

229
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:55,899
that pretty soon here that'll just

230
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:59,169
determine how long we run the soil so I

231
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,730
would like to know if the interesting to

232
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:02,860
see what levels of the root-knot

233
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,899
nematode are acceptable or if it's just

234
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,750
any sign of it is it's instantly over

235
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,190
but that's where we're at with that yeah

236
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,958
I want to talk a little bit more about

237
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,399
some of the technology you've used over

238
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,049
the years and what works for you and

239
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
what doesn't but since he brought up the

240
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:19,539
root-knot nematode let's talk a little

241
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,399
bit about that so in I I received some

242
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:23,259
clones from you back in the day right

243
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,870
after you got this because I wanted to

244
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:28,629
do some trials trying to come up with an

245
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,419
organic cloning solution and I remember

246
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:33,820
my plants they just look sickly they

247
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:35,860
never grew you know and this is like

248
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,190
after a month they really hadn't grown

249
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,709
much at all and it was until I pulled

250
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,920
the plants out and looked at the roots

251
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:46,509
that you actually do see these nodules

252
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,729
on the roots oh I think I have a photo

253
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:50,049
of it somewhere I could share but what

254
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,199
were your experiences in terms of

255
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:59,889
symptoms for this particular nematode

256
00:10:52,198 --> 00:11:03,009
yeah you're you're gonna see well when

257
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:05,709
it's a really small levels gosh you will

258
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:08,569
see your plant health be affected you'll

259
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:10,789
have like one plant in a bed that

260
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,340
doesn't look good it looks sickly and

261
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:15,019
you can tell that it's that it's nothing

262
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,540
above the canopy that's doing it it's

263
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:20,809
identical to the others and so this

264
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:22,519
plant will look like it'll have it'll

265
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,659
have chlorosis and the leaves and stuff

266
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,220
like that it'll look like it has a

267
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:30,439
serious root issue and so when you go

268
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,550
ahead and grab that plant and pull it

269
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,320
out and pull out real easy and it almost

270
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:38,299
looks like there's a bunch of perlite

271
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,640
stuck in your roots those nodules or a

272
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:43,250
bunch of round balls on the roots I

273
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,620
think it is what we would call gulling

274
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,980
in a tree you know when a wasp or

275
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,200
something lays an egg and the oak tree

276
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,210
builds a big ball around it that's

277
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,910
exactly what happens in the roots and so

278
00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:00,920
the roots grow around the nematode and

279
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:03,259
at that point the nematode now has a

280
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:07,189
permanent home and it is inside your

281
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:09,200
root system and also when we went as

282
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,090
soon as we pull up a plant and we see

283
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,210
signs of the root-knot nematode that

284
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:17,210
just means that entire facility needs

285
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:21,019
its soil replaced and we have not

286
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:24,259
discovered a way to sanitize the beds or

287
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:26,689
the room to avoid it coming back and I

288
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:29,600
think that speaks to its larvae and how

289
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,730
small it is and how durable it is the

290
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,519
larvae can last for three years dormant

291
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,350
and essentially it's dust so you know

292
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,049
what grow rooms look like and stuff it's

293
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,399
pretty hard to get them to that clean so

294
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,529
how have you tried to treat I don't even

295
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,990
try to variety of products to sort of

296
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,789
maintain the levels below an economic

297
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,500
threshold I know you've completely

298
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:50,240
cleaned a room so it's not like you just

299
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,519
pulled out the soil and brought in new

300
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,799
so you guys scrubbed and bleached and

301
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,789
really cleaned what have you done to try

302
00:12:54,799 --> 00:13:01,639
and control this particular pest well

303
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:04,899
we've just researched products that that

304
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:08,449
treat for plant parasitic nematodes and

305
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:14,750
I don't know surprisingly there's not

306
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:16,460
that many I guess and we I guess we

307
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:21,049
haven't found anything that that that

308
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:22,460
seems to be very effective where we've

309
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:25,099
gotten the roof not never toe

310
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:28,519
and when we replace oil and sterilized

311
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,920
facility we seem to get about four or

312
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,659
five crops without it and it and it

313
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:39,250
doesn't doesn't seem no matter what

314
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:39,250
products we use we've been using

315
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:46,370
venerate which is it's just the it's

316
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,830
like majesty from maroon Bioworks and

317
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,860
that targets on on plant parasitic

318
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:56,770
nematodes but it also it's a biological

319
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:59,450
but it also kills beneficial insects too

320
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,279
and that's what we were finding was most

321
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,840
things that were going after these plant

322
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,819
parasitic nematodes are also going to

323
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,310
kill the rest of our beneficial insects

324
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,830
which with the living soil I think is a

325
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:11,829
really bad idea it's just what as soon

326
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,420
as you're been officials are gone you

327
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:20,960
generally have a host of issues of other

328
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:23,719
of other plant pests let's see here we

329
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,990
have a theory that the stern EFL ta

330
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,560
which is uh it's known as nemesis two

331
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,560
from BASF but it's a it's a beneficial

332
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:36,679
nematode that targets thrips and fungus

333
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:40,279
gnat larvae but it seems like when

334
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,949
you're using that you don't have the

335
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,100
root-knot nematode problems like

336
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:47,900
actually we used to we used to add these

337
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,170
beneficial nematodes and I think it was

338
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,519
turning a filthy eighth but I'm not sure

339
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,990
before we got the fruit Mountain emmitt

340
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,850
ode and actually the root-knot nematode

341
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,860
we got when we had quit using applying

342
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,909
beneficial nematodes so there's still

343
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,950
some mystery to it and if there's

344
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:07,789
another product we use is called doTERRA

345
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:09,350
or something like that and there's yet

346
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:12,230
another product that I just have not

347
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,120
been able to get it's called Melek on WG

348
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,289
it's from syrtis but it's a frozen

349
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,620
fungal product that's hard to ship and

350
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:26,389
and recently what I've been using in the

351
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:33,230
program is is from Bioworks it's as a

352
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:34,730
rack and it's mold techs and that and

353
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,029
that focuses on plant parasitic

354
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,509
nematodes

355
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:41,639
being safe with most beneficials so yeah

356
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,679
that's kind of where we're at at this

357
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,230
point so let's talk a little bit about

358
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,819
your IPM program and protocol so I know

359
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,330
when you enter your facility you're

360
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,750
putting on booties that are clean to

361
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,980
help prevent some of that transfer and

362
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,200
making sure that your clothes are clean

363
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,730
and you I know you especially I've been

364
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,009
very diligent about making sure when you

365
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,740
move from one location to another or

366
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:06,600
outside of your your your rec grow it

367
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,549
legit north that you're not getting

368
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,759
exposed to any other pests if possible

369
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:13,409
your clothing or anything like that now

370
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:18,629
what sort of things are you doing in the

371
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:20,539
facility itself to help maintain you

372
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:23,129
know control pests and things like that

373
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:26,879
um well since we were just talking about

374
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:28,919
the nematode and I just touched on a

375
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,950
little bit ago with the analogy of the

376
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,689
river and upstream and downstream that

377
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,790
that that's one of the main things is

378
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,770
just make sure your tooling your

379
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:40,559
equipment your own bodies your personnel

380
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:43,980
aren't going from flower rooms with

381
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:49,229
amended soil back into bedroom and

382
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:51,000
propagation and then just you know

383
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,940
little things like trying to treat the

384
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,169
ground is a place of no return

385
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,660
you know something falls on the ground

386
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:59,429
or something that is now dirty try try

387
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,909
to try not to let things hit the ground

388
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:05,039
anyplace that could potentially have

389
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:07,470
dust and dirt that is untreated or

390
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,199
unsterilized as potential for that to

391
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,870
harbor that guy there so it's it's a

392
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,970
real challenge because you've got you've

393
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,799
got personnel and you've got a facility

394
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,920
that likes with disability that we have

395
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,480
is it's a renovated egg farm and it's

396
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,829
got pretty rough concrete and stuff we

397
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,328
did the best we can with all of our

398
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:26,039
floor coverings and stuff should make it

399
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:29,159
to make surfaces that we can sterilize

400
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,960
and clean but it really just comes down

401
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,930
to the traps at consistency and

402
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,549
cleanliness and everybody understanding

403
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,400
what the goal is that we're trying to

404
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,899
achieve so it really takes everyone on

405
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
the team working together on this to

406
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,140
maintain it and you don't currently

407
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,929
believe you have the root-knot nematode

408
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,340
in your facility but you're just very

409
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:48,540
diligent because it's something that

410
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,089
you've dealt with in the past it's just

411
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,139
such

412
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:56,899
just such a devastating pest yeah

413
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,000
absolutely devastating I mean we in

414
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,030
theory based off what we found in the

415
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,269
past we can amend your soil for I mean

416
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:10,519
he's easily five years and so the cost

417
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:13,309
savings of just amending that soil and

418
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,779
not having to replace it and besides

419
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:18,250
this the cost of the soil is just the

420
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:23,569
actual physical process of removing it

421
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:25,519
it's it's huge and also we build a lot

422
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,799
of biology in the soil that's wonderful

423
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,690
if we can keep it yeah can you tell me a

424
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,029
little bit about your process sort of

425
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,529
from from clone to harvest I want to get

426
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:36,200
into a little bit of the technology that

427
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,430
you guys use in the rooms but can you

428
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,819
just take me through I think you have

429
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,259
sort of a unique cloning method and some

430
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,559
of the stuff that you've sort of figured

431
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:47,150
out the little tips and tricks that make

432
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,929
make legit what it is I guess

433
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:56,990
yeah I'm very proud of the cloning

434
00:18:50,930 --> 00:19:00,350
method once again Jaya when we were when

435
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:04,039
we were still partnered up together on

436
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:06,409
an operation he he told me he told me

437
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,970
once he's like hey you know rooting

438
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,470
hormone he's like like you know you

439
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,089
don't really need that I was like what

440
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,519
what are you talking about that that's

441
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:17,269
crazy talk it's really expensive you

442
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:20,650
know and so I just thought well okay

443
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:23,019
let's see here I just quit using it and

444
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:27,170
sure enough I just took a little longer

445
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:30,650
and then I'm not sure how exactly it

446
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,230
happened so I was I I actually asked you

447
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,759
you know what do you recommend for for

448
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,069
propagation you're like oh I like these

449
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,440
Oasis cubes and so I tried the Oasis

450
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:42,259
cubes and I really really liked them

451
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,769
they worked really well and I would put

452
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,900
the Oasis cubes in a tray and put the

453
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,940
dome over it and then rip the vents off

454
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,530
the dome and then just water those trays

455
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,880
right through the dome you saw me do

456
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,960
that once and you like laughs you

457
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,470
couldn't believe what I was doing right

458
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,160
so I I was doing that and it was working

459
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,569
pretty darn well

460
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,910
but then when as soon as I started

461
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:03,048
having people work for me they wouldn't

462
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,700
really understand like have you

463
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:05,898
water this dome I don't know how to put

464
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,360
the right amount of water in it and

465
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:10,038
stuff and I'm actually Buster that you

466
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,599
met crazy Buster he just started poking

467
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:12,919
much holes in the tray so you could

468
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,759
water it every day and let the water

469
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:18,230
just go through it and that really

470
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:22,038
helped that was the ticket so now we put

471
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,720
those Oasis cubes in drain trays put the

472
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:26,089
domes on them rip the vents off the dome

473
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,169
water through the dome we basically keep

474
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:30,918
those domes at like 90 to 100% humidity

475
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:33,769
to the point where they're almost

476
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:36,019
molding but that's what really makes

477
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:38,569
them route well and then of course one

478
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:40,368
of the main keys is you're taking a

479
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,939
cutting off of a really healthy plant

480
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:45,558
that's probably the most important thing

481
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,028
but we will take that cutting we'll

482
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,009
stick it in there wasted scoob's will

483
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:51,200
drench them every day with water run it

484
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:52,999
real high humidity in there and we will

485
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,788
add nothing but water no rooting hormone

486
00:20:52,999 --> 00:21:00,858
and in about two weeks they'll start to

487
00:20:55,788 --> 00:21:03,108
root and and they will continue to root

488
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:07,519
and like one of these last like last

489
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:11,028
month we took 260 cuttings and only four

490
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,288
of them didn't root and so as long as

491
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,519
you're not in a big rush like if you

492
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:15,288
don't need your cuttings in ten days

493
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,749
then you don't really need the rooting

494
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:19,398
hormone and it's a more affordable

495
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:21,558
program and we've just had really good

496
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:23,079
success with it so the timing on it

497
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:29,509
works out for you

498
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:31,308
yeah so in medical days we would we

499
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:33,739
would take a cutting off of a plant that

500
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:35,808
was going into the flower room and then

501
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:38,659
that cutting would be would become our

502
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:41,599
next generation and now getting into

503
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:43,190
these just these more productive rooms

504
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,278
that are sealed with co2 and everything

505
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,379
that timing wasn't working out so we

506
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,058
switched to moms so we've got a whole

507
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:52,849
generation of plants going into a flower

508
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:55,398
room we just pull out the genetics that

509
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:58,368
we want to keep and we keep those aside

510
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,928
as mom's and I think right now three

511
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:02,298
weeks later three weeks and the flowers

512
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:04,909
when we take our cuttings and they're at

513
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:06,829
what we feel is an appropriate size when

514
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:10,070
when that crop is done and the next

515
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:11,658
rounds going in now can you talk a

516
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:15,230
little bit about that extra room that

517
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:16,490
you created you're willing to talk about

518
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,529
yeah

519
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:22,250
that was a little brainchild of Jaya and

520
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:25,849
I so I was just talking about the dome

521
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:29,950
and that dome is I mean I think it's 90

522
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:29,949
percent humidity and maybe even more

523
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:36,589
when you when when a plant roots in the

524
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,389
dome and it's and you're gonna pot it

525
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:40,609
into it we pot we go from the dome into

526
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:45,020
a three and a half inch pot when you

527
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:50,000
caught it it it often will wilt and I

528
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:51,859
think it's as those roots are our first

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,329
learning how to uptake nutrients it's

530
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:56,149
kind of a hard thing to do and you're

531
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:58,549
taking it from a dome which is very very

532
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:03,650
low VPD to a bedroom which has a little

533
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:05,899
higher VPD and we created a transitional

534
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,600
space kind of an incubator an in-between

535
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,610
zone from a dome that's ninety percent

536
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,678
humidity and maybe eighty degrees to a

537
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:14,569
bedroom that's seventy percent humidity

538
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,429
at 70 degrees so we just picked a middle

539
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:19,849
ground at about eighty eighty-five

540
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:23,240
percent humidity and t5 lighting so it's

541
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:27,109
real low infrared and we put all these

542
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,910
freshly potted plants into this into

543
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,619
this room and normally we'd get you know

544
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,509
probably forty percent would wilt for a

545
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:35,329
couple days and then pop back and now

546
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:37,549
they just don't will so it's really cool

547
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:40,609
so it doesn't affect our routing success

548
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:42,980
but it affects our our propagation

549
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:44,959
success from there and then as soon as

550
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,519
they are perky and standing up in that

551
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,769
room we pull them right out and

552
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,119
introduce into the bedroom and what size

553
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:52,119
containers are using in the bedroom

554
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,270
using two gallon pots right now so we'll

555
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,860
go from the three-and-a-half inch tall

556
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:03,558
pot to a two gallon pot and and when

557
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:05,329
that plant of approaching maturity is

558
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,639
right when we want to get it into the

559
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:08,149
flower room so so it's not running out

560
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,450
of water

561
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,530
it hasn't its roots haven't hit hit the

562
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,090
point where they think they're starting

563
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:16,700
to coil and stuff like that so it's

564
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:19,029
still really in its stride how long do

565
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,710
you think that process is in terms of

566
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:22,069
amount of time as well as height of the

567
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,940
plant

568
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:30,439
approximately yeah well we take that

569
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:32,870
cutting three weeks in the flower

570
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:37,278
and it takes a couple of weeks to root

571
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:39,138
and then it's got about four weeks after

572
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,440
that to outgrow its during a half inch

573
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:44,269
pot get into a two gallon pot you know

574
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,620
grow into that soil filling us that we

575
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:50,179
can easily transplant it and so it would

576
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:52,278
probably at that point it would be it

577
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:54,919
would get to about maybe a little to

578
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:57,679
eighteen inches tall or maybe even two

579
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:00,110
feet some of the taller stuff so what I

580
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,840
would call like a smaller medium size

581
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:05,168
plant okay and from there you're taking

582
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:09,558
it and transplanting it directly into

583
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:12,019
the flower room which has beds on has

584
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:15,678
rolling beds and the soil that you're

585
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:17,058
displacing from the soil coming in just

586
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,500
the amount of space it takes to plant

587
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:22,308
the plant that's leaving the facility

588
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:26,659
and not coming back yeah currently yep

589
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:28,428
but now that I've got this lab up north

590
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:30,379
and Blaine what I'm going to do is I'm

591
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:31,879
going to take samples from all this

592
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:33,888
display soil and I'm going to test it

593
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:36,319
for the nematode because if the

594
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:39,469
nematodes not there we could just use

595
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,990
the soil again and or or use it for

596
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,190
maybe and maybe outdoor production or

597
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,849
greenhouse production or something

598
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,470
that's yeah but in theory if it doesn't

599
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:49,819
have a nematode there we could put it

600
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,839
right back into flour I'm just a little

601
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:54,888
bit a little bit trigger shy yeah tell

602
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,079
me a little about your flower rooms

603
00:25:54,888 --> 00:26:00,019
because I know this was sort of your

604
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:03,168
opportunity to design something based on

605
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:05,210
your experience from your medical days

606
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,399
yet I know you were also limited on

607
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,870
budget so it's not your ideal room I

608
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,949
know there's some things that you would

609
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,658
want to do differently but what were you

610
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,690
able to kind of come up with based on

611
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:18,649
your your limited resources and the

612
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,419
space what the space was Lao yeah um

613
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:21,648
once again I got to give a bunch of

614
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:26,629
credit to Jaya

615
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:29,239
I mean well to my own credit I was

616
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:31,609
building a wood bed a wooden bed that

617
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,319
has slope to it and Pont and it's

618
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:36,079
wrapped in pond liner and has a drain in

619
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:38,480
it and those beds work really well but

620
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,638
they're not basically efficient they're

621
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,990
stationary they have aisles as you know

622
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:43,879
you don't want piles when you're

623
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:48,440
lighting up a whole room

624
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,559
so Jaya did an experiment he used

625
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,650
fluence LEDs but he built wood beds just

626
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:57,558
like mine but he found a track and a V

627
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,080
caster they can mount on these beds so

628
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,910
all the beds roll together so basically

629
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,039
you can go all these beds and have a big

630
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,779
continuous block of canopy and then if

631
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,339
you need to go in and service your beds

632
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:11,539
you can slide them apart and get in

633
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:13,369
there he hit some amazing numbers some

634
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:15,440
of the best numbers we've ever seen out

635
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:18,079
of that little that little rig that he

636
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,860
did in a garage and so I just took that

637
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:26,419
idea and with one of my partners who the

638
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:29,740
is a steel expert master machinist we

639
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:32,509
designed a metal rolling bed and a

640
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:36,890
former employee of his made them all out

641
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:39,700
of a small shop and these beds are 19

642
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:42,620
feet long they're about four feet wide

643
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:45,980
inside dimensions and they have four

644
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:49,039
legs and those legs have thousand-pound

645
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:52,400
8 inch v casters on them they're really

646
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,319
stout and by thousand kind of mean they

647
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,150
can hold a thousand pounds one of these

648
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,240
beds holds it up two and a half yards of

649
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:02,600
your soil so in the neighborhood of four

650
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,069
thousand pounds or something and you can

651
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,879
push these beds and you can move them

652
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:09,889
yourself on the track hindsight now is

653
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,300
that you know you're in a room maybe

654
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,429
you're spraying that's the worst

655
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:14,750
situation is a floor slippery and you're

656
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,370
trying to move these four thousand

657
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,279
pounds rolling bed and your feet are

658
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:22,009
sliding that's the one thing that I that

659
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,500
we need to modify or change on the next

660
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:26,119
design it's some sort of a mechanical

661
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,650
way to move the bed belong and we were

662
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:29,029
thinking about even like a wheel at the

663
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,550
end of it that you just turn and it has

664
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:34,450
a little beer driving those own but that

665
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:39,859
that was a huge game changer

666
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:41,569
that made these rooms so productive by

667
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:44,178
having that much soil in the room and

668
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:46,939
all that tight together so I didn't

669
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:49,370
quite hit the numbers that Jaya did with

670
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,929
the LEDs in that garage but we're

671
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:54,469
getting over three pounds of light

672
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:56,050
untrimmed right now since since we grow

673
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:59,110
fur

674
00:28:56,049 --> 00:29:01,539
for a pre-roll joint we don't really get

675
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:03,189
I don't necessarily get trim numbers we

676
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:06,220
do trim everything but I don't know what

677
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,410
that is so I mean that's been that's

678
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,059
been the goal for a long time like a lot

679
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,610
of growers trying to hit that magical

680
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:14,710
three pound of light number yeah and

681
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:18,579
then you're also so you're using

682
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,440
double-ended HPS which I know is not

683
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:24,009
your optimal setup but you had a ton of

684
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,070
them available to you yeah I already had

685
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:30,579
some of these double-ended lighting at

686
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:32,259
the AC de it's it you can air-cool just

687
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:33,970
the hood itself and out the bulb which

688
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:36,160
makes it good for a budget grower you

689
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,690
just you do a lot more ducting you got

690
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,370
to put in a whole air system to air cool

691
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:42,360
these lights but then you can size down

692
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:45,429
your AC substantially which is a huge

693
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:47,709
money saver so yeah that's exactly what

694
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,900
I did up there when I was buying the

695
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:54,789
lighting you happen to find they were

696
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,470
clearing out this AC de ballast that has

697
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,089
the ballast attached to it the hood and

698
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,339
ballast all attached so we got our

699
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:02,349
lighting for that whole facility for

700
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:05,019
cash like eight grand or something like

701
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:10,899
that which is almost unheard of and it

702
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:13,569
allowed me to do about at least 33% less

703
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,160
AC than most people do but probably

704
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:18,339
about half as much air conditioning as

705
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:21,009
most people run and it's working it's

706
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:23,369
working pretty darn good those lights

707
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:26,259
you just got to run them really high and

708
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:27,759
we we have them fixed stationary we

709
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,970
don't move them we let the plants just

710
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,099
grow toward them yeah I know ideally you

711
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,839
want to switch to LEDs but the cost

712
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:37,480
difference just wasn't something you can

713
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:38,799
do at the time but what are some of the

714
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,539
things you've learned with this new room

715
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,309
cuz I know this is your first time with

716
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:45,159
a sealed room first time was with

717
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:47,109
rolling tables I know you've been using

718
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,790
blue mats now for a while and you're

719
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:50,529
quite familiar with those I think I put

720
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:52,930
a picture up on our date on our

721
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:54,339
Instagram from one of your your beds a

722
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,279
while back in terms of the blue mat

723
00:30:54,339 --> 00:31:00,159
setup but take me through some of the

724
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,289
fits and starts in terms of what you've

725
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:07,509
learned from from sort of this new

726
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:09,430
environment as a grower yeah one of the

727
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:11,799
first things is like

728
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,170
well how much tea humidification do you

729
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,269
need like our bigger room that you just

730
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,460
were up there looking at it's 1100

731
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:22,869
square foot room maybe a little under

732
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:27,880
900 square feet a canopy but there's 28

733
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:30,519
29 yards of soil in there and so if you

734
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:34,000
do typical calculations for

735
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:36,579
dehumidification it gives you a start

736
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,349
but I kind of had to just almost just

737
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:41,049
pick a number of dehumidifiers and try

738
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:42,879
it and I went with quest I've had great

739
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:45,849
success with him in the past they have a

740
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,410
really good reputation and that was one

741
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:51,389
of the challenges with sizing those guys

742
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:54,460
and did pretty good right off the bat I

743
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:56,080
can't remember I have a theory four

744
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,610
pints per square foot but it's not at

745
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,740
the top of my head right now but

746
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:03,069
basically that big thousand square foot

747
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:07,930
room has for quests 225 commercial units

748
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:09,429
but that dehumidified perfectly so what

749
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,170
about air flow and air movement around

750
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,269
your room I know you ran into some of

751
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:15,850
the challenges your first cycle with the

752
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:17,349
plants getting too big in terms of

753
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:18,730
growing more than you expected and also

754
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:20,139
getting transplanted a little late as

755
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,180
you're getting set up can you talk a

756
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,900
little bit about how you've sort of

757
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:28,840
dialed that in over the last few cycles

758
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:32,170
yeah so up until now been running

759
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:34,990
smaller rooms basements garages bedrooms

760
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:38,560
all that kind of thing and oscillating

761
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:40,809
wall fans are the standards there but

762
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,149
once you get into a really big room all

763
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:44,829
those oscillating wall fans they just

764
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,130
create a bunch of turbulence and they're

765
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:53,109
not able to effectively penetrate that

766
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:56,350
core of the room the the middle so I

767
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:58,659
took a stab at horizontal airflow HAF

768
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:03,309
which is the kind of the standard of the

769
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:04,870
greenhouse industry and it's just it's

770
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:06,309
exactly like this like it states

771
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:08,439
horizontal air flow so you're what

772
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:11,109
you're doing is you're you're creating a

773
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,320
vortex and you're moving all the air in

774
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:15,849
the room in kind of a cyclone and you're

775
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,409
just trying to move a big wall of air

776
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:19,569
not necessarily very fast you're trying

777
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,930
to move it all and stir it in a circle

778
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:26,139
so we got a bunch of HAF greenhouse

779
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,759
and I started off with just a handful of

780
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,890
them kind of spected out the way you

781
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,829
would a greenhouse and we fired it up

782
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,650
and it was clearly not enough and so we

783
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:38,679
kept throwing more fans at it all in a

784
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,630
spiral and we got it we got it moving we

785
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,700
got the big wall of air moving in a

786
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:49,780
cyclone there's kind of an eye to the

787
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:52,960
storm but it's pretty good but then yeah

788
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:56,440
like you were saying I came into these

789
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,509
rooms not you know not really knowing

790
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,820
how to run a real big room like this so

791
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:04,750
I came into him with a lot of plants and

792
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:06,399
pretty big plants and I raised I got the

793
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,349
lights up to 100% real quick

794
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,269
I'd really dumped in co2 on I'm trying

795
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:11,799
to really hit it out of the park but

796
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:14,380
ended up kind of breaking the bat

797
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,010
instead the plants all took off and got

798
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,619
real leggy

799
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:20,380
and you seen the rooms you know the

800
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:22,839
lighting stands at about 12 feet the bed

801
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,849
span is about 3 feet some of our plants

802
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,820
you know ripped up there and kissed the

803
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:29,589
lights and so as soon as you got as soon

804
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,570
as you have varying heights in a canopy

805
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,320
and you're trying to do horizontal

806
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,720
airflow

807
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,080
those are like mountaintops in your wind

808
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,639
and it just it stopped our airflow in

809
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,769
some areas so then I got then we got

810
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,049
crazy heat right where we would have a

811
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:47,019
short strain next to a tall strain we

812
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:53,380
wouldn't be able to mix the air there so

813
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:55,000
I we we got better at at getting

814
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,030
appropriate sized plants in there and

815
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,539
the right number of plants and and then

816
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,610
using the right amounts of co2 to not

817
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:05,079
get the rapid growth when you don't want

818
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,660
it and to get the rapid growth when you

819
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,779
do want it and that is really help that

820
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:12,339
horizontal air flow works during the

821
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,610
process I also learned about vertical

822
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,240
air flow the Vossler mandi flow fans

823
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:21,490
probably the most well-known from that

824
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,919
that style and it's basically a ceiling

825
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:27,039
fan that blows straight up into like a

826
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,519
toroid type shape so basically what it

827
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:33,130
does is it it pushes air upwards that

828
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:36,940
spirals around and and then comes back

829
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,490
up which helps get co2 to those

830
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,769
timaná under the leash and I think the

831
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:42,939
[ __ ] I'm curious to try vertical

832
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:44,440
airflow to see how it compares in the

833
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,769
horizontal or slow some people really

834
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,869
really square by it but if you can get

835
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:52,119
your canopy at the right height not too

836
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:54,430
tall and consistent the horizontal

837
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,960
airflow works pretty darn well and I

838
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:57,250
think that leads us into the next thing

839
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,789
you were maybe going to ask about with

840
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:04,059
the co2 I've been I've been using

841
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:06,430
atmospheric co2 air exchange rooms ever

842
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:10,329
since Jai and I had the house in Seattle

843
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:12,940
in 2011 so I it's kind of embarrassing

844
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:17,380
but I was going into rec without without

845
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:19,088
real deal co2 experience though I just

846
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,039
started dumping co2 and the rooms right

847
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:23,739
off the get-go and the plants just went

848
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:27,099
bonkers and just stretched for the light

849
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:29,798
so now what I'm doing I following the

850
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:32,588
guidelines of some other growers and one

851
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:35,108
of my partners to help me out a lot and

852
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:38,288
we ease them into the co2 now that first

853
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:40,058
three weeks we just eat them in we don't

854
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:42,670
want rapid growth in the first three

855
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:44,950
weeks we want them to root down and get

856
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:47,680
all established in the bed and I think

857
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:49,509
about the end of week three you're

858
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,649
seeing you're seeing little buds and you

859
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,410
know they're not going to stretch too

860
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:56,798
much at that point then we start giving

861
00:36:53,409 --> 00:37:00,308
them the real high levels of co2 and and

862
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:02,650
do that for about three weeks and that

863
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:05,410
puts you around the end of week seven or

864
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,630
week seven ish and that's when we start

865
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:10,509
cutting it back for for the last two

866
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:13,119
weeks which really helps them plump up

867
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,130
and finish which we thought that was a

868
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,079
miss for a while which is funny now but

869
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,289
no it really works well but you know

870
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,089
what the big thing was and you'll find

871
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:24,789
this interesting because it involves

872
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:27,308
your soil is when you amend the soil or

873
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:29,880
even brand-new soil when you put 28

874
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:33,220
yards of it in the room and you seal it

875
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,869
the co2 that it produces is substantial

876
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:38,019
to say the least it is I'm pretty

877
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:40,778
amazing so I had put in an air system an

878
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:44,259
air exchange system to to specifically

879
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:46,179
deal with high nighttime co2 levels as a

880
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,650
way to evacuate it but I just didn't

881
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:49,960
really I'd never wrapped my head around

882
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,680
what our high levels and why do we want

883
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,809
to avoid it

884
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:54,849
all these things so I was I was having

885
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:57,699
these problems with plants just not

886
00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:01,000
finishing and getting so skinny and just

887
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:02,439
really woody and big and weird I mean we

888
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,199
grew some amazing buds it was kind of

889
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,340
cool look and you saw one of those crops

890
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,689
but it wasn't finishing right it wasn't

891
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,809
getting the profile we were looking for

892
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:14,440
and everything and I was talking to Jay

893
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:16,840
about it and he told me that a lot of a

894
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,179
lot of people experienced what they call

895
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,880
night growth with high co2 levels at

896
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:23,829
night which is which is something that

897
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,860
you don't want and I'm not I'm not

898
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:29,469
exactly sure on the science there but as

899
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,740
soon as I started evacuating nighttime

900
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:34,179
co2 and getting it down like definitely

901
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:37,089
under a thousand ppm or maybe even

902
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:39,389
closer to 600 or something as soon as we

903
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,860
start evacuating those nighttime levels

904
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:44,079
our plants started finishing at a better

905
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,880
more of a proper rate and then as soon

906
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,500
as we lowered the levels in the first

907
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,660
three weeks it got rid of that crazy

908
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,489
high growth and then cutting the co2

909
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:53,679
back at the end allows them to send us

910
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:58,479
real nice though with learning all of

911
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,259
that that's made these rooms really take

912
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,599
off now

913
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,970
and not and we can predict the growth

914
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,460
that we're going to have and so it won't

915
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:08,980
affect our our air flow and everything

916
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,240
and these lights are so powerful if they

917
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,130
let the plants get too close to the

918
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,519
light it's really hard on them it's

919
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,800
they're just they're so hot yeah can you

920
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,789
throw some numbers around for co2 in

921
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,340
terms of ranges that you like to see

922
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:26,469
yeah well first of all like we would go

923
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,750
into a one of these rooms at night after

924
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:32,349
the beds are freshly turned and you'll

925
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,940
see 30 400 ppm co2 at night in the room

926
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,199
which some other growers would probably

927
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:40,119
be like oh my god dude what are you

928
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:42,219
doing but uh that that just shows you

929
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:47,500
how much co2 comes off of these beds

930
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:49,629
they're like little reactors so by by

931
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,539
running basically I've run air exchange

932
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,130
every 15 minutes I've got I've got 15

933
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,869
minutes on 15 minutes off of air

934
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,610
exchange all through every dark cycle of

935
00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:01,539
these rooms and that keeps the co2

936
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:04,000
levels anywheres from 500 to 900 ppm at

937
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:04,599
night it's really hard to get the levels

938
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,849
low

939
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,769
when we first amend because they're just

940
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:10,480
producing so much co2 but that's also a

941
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:12,460
time when a little bit of excess co2 I

942
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,719
don't think it's so bad you really don't

943
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,090
want that co2 in there when they're

944
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:18,730
budding and trying to finish and then

945
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:21,400
when you do kick on the co2 what levels

946
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:25,300
are you shooting for well I'll just go

947
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,500
back to the bedroom dip so so

948
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,600
atmospheric co2

949
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,610
I think it's 350 parts per million or

950
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,309
350 to 400 somewhere in there that's

951
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:36,280
what's outside in the environment so

952
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:38,440
we'll run our bedroom at that if we're

953
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,660
trying to keep it low or keep it kind of

954
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,130
moderate growth but if we want to step

955
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:43,569
it up and get things growing faster

956
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,309
we'll go up to six seven hundred or

957
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,320
something in bed I don't I haven't gone

958
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,469
any higher that than that in the bedroom

959
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:53,140
because it just hasn't been necessary

960
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:55,539
and then when the plants go from veg to

961
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:58,119
flower we try to match every condition

962
00:40:55,539 --> 00:41:01,719
we can as close as we can so we'll do

963
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,750
we'll do a similar co2 level we'll try

964
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:07,359
to get a similar amount of a light value

965
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:10,750
of our lights dimmed and everything and

966
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,960
humidity and temperature and and then we

967
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,010
will we'll go for those levels for the

968
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,900
first three weeks

969
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:21,070
and right now I'm six to seven hundred

970
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,230
parts per million of co2 you for those

971
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:26,019
first three weeks and then as soon as we

972
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:29,860
see those flowers developing then I will

973
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:32,440
step it up in two days to 1250 1300

974
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,570
something like that for first four three

975
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,150
weeks straight and then step it right

976
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,760
back down to about 650 something like

977
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,010
that and those are some levels that my

978
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,400
partner with a lot more co2 experience

979
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:47,200
than me gave me to work with and and it

980
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,240
we just we just grew to the most

981
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:53,169
beautiful crops that I've ever been a

982
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:54,789
part of and and that was a big part of

983
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:56,950
it yeah I love that you're always

984
00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:00,460
learning and tweaking and figuring stuff

985
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:03,099
out as you go I think that's I think

986
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,599
that's the what makes a good growers is

987
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:06,400
that you're constantly improving and

988
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:09,940
learning and making changes and things

989
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,869
like that so that's great that's the fun

990
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,659
part too

991
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:15,699
if that's it's like I'm a gearhead also

992
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:17,500
and that's like the tuning alright I

993
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,489
feel like and and that's the part where

994
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,500
we really get to in

995
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:23,349
act in interface with the plants in the

996
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:26,860
room that's part of my passion in this

997
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:29,679
too is I really really like when biology

998
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:33,340
meets machine and they work together in

999
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:36,009
harmony and that's I love that about our

1000
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,320
drones a interesting mix of everything

1001
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:41,500
from creepy crawly insects and beautiful

1002
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,570
green plants to like you know huge HVAC

1003
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,179
systems and dehumidifiers and ducting

1004
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:49,990
and industrial things and I also got a

1005
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:51,730
real big kick out of us remodeling and

1006
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:54,069
renovating an old egg farm you know that

1007
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,710
was really dilapidated but we were

1008
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:59,289
totally able to polish it up and make it

1009
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,789
work and I think we impressed even the

1010
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:02,829
landlord and some of our partners that

1011
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:05,590
we could do what we did and what most

1012
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:07,389
people saw the tear down building yeah

1013
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,950
no it looks it looks great in there it's

1014
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:11,769
it's fun to come visit when I get the

1015
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:12,849
chance one other question that popped up

1016
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:16,110
in my head while you were talking about

1017
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:20,019
was VPD I know this is something that

1018
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,960
you learned about and again give a lot

1019
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:24,759
of credit to joy here for a lot of this

1020
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,559
sort of as you were growing and you kind

1021
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,140
of came up with the phrase swamp mode at

1022
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,219
one point as you're experimenting can

1023
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,539
you talk a little bit about what you've

1024
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:34,239
kind of like figured out because I've

1025
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:36,489
had like legitimate scientists come on

1026
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,829
that have PhDs in airflow and air

1027
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,389
movement and loud what they share is

1028
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:43,150
obviously really interesting and

1029
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:44,799
important and it's the basis for a lot

1030
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,970
of information but what are you what

1031
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,530
have you figured out just sort of you

1032
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:50,409
know hands on the ground as a grower

1033
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,970
over the years with your experience with

1034
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:54,608
all of this and what VPD chard are you

1035
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:57,429
using okay I'm glad you asked those

1036
00:43:54,608 --> 00:43:59,108
those are good questions kind of the the

1037
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:02,529
way that we're all taught to grow

1038
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:04,690
cannabis is humidity is your enemy and

1039
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:07,030
you're just trying to keep your humidity

1040
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,889
down you're just rammed down your head

1041
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,869
that just drive your humidity down so

1042
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:12,819
you made it - maybe causes mold just get

1043
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,559
it down get it down get it down so I was

1044
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,210
like oh okay well I'm pretty good at

1045
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,519
building me their exchange rooms with a

1046
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:23,079
lot of dehumidification and we can get

1047
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:26,530
our humidity really low which my little

1048
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,358
group our little group we just we didn't

1049
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,500
think that the humidity played an

1050
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:31,940
important role we didn't realize the

1051
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,130
role that humidity might actually play

1052
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:39,079
so you asked about swamp mode so it's

1053
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:41,360
funny story there was I was growing my

1054
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,369
partner Buster was growing and then Jaya

1055
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,380
was also growing at this time this is

1056
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:47,119
this is an area of our I feel some of

1057
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,640
our greatest innovation because we all

1058
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,219
had our little experimental rooms that

1059
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:55,400
we could run independently and share

1060
00:44:52,219 --> 00:45:00,379
what we were finding so Jaya

1061
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:02,000
he's our brain right he's all over he's

1062
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,740
in the venues that you know about where

1063
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,869
people talk about things and read

1064
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:07,879
scientific documents and stuff so Jai is

1065
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,019
learning all about VPD and what does he

1066
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,610
look great for pressure deficit and

1067
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:11,929
there's charts and doesn't really know

1068
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:14,390
how to apply it yeah but he's like this

1069
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:19,279
is the big thing this is a big deal okay

1070
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:21,769
it's another acronym well meanwhile my

1071
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,680
partner Buster who he's just the

1072
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:26,659
absolute character you've met him he's

1073
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:29,359
one of the only people I know who could

1074
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:31,969
somehow have his exhaust system off for

1075
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:35,660
his room have all of the lights on and

1076
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:38,750
flood the room somehow this guy did that

1077
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:42,199
so all the lights are on but the exhaust

1078
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:45,530
systems off and the room is flooded so

1079
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:48,589
he accidentally swamped his room okay

1080
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:51,830
and so the and and so what what I call

1081
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:55,400
swampy is you know it's upper 70s and

1082
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:57,139
it's anything over 70% humidity in the

1083
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,000
upper 70s that gives you that swamp

1084
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:00,619
feeling like you just got off the plane

1085
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,210
and the East Coast or maybe even Hawaii

1086
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:04,880
and you hit that wall of air you can

1087
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,550
really feel it well that's what Buster

1088
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,500
did he accidentally he accidentally

1089
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:12,380
swamped his room and got it up in the

1090
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,420
high 70s and humidity but what he

1091
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,780
noticed was all of the leads started

1092
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,610
standing up people call it praying but

1093
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,460
all the leaf started standing up really

1094
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:26,150
that was firm he was like that's

1095
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:28,400
probably a good thing so long story

1096
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:32,329
short jaya was all was learning about

1097
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,039
BPD online and and humidifiers and that

1098
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,599
they had some applications we had only

1099
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:37,099
heard about dehumidifiers for growing

1100
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,029
and now we're talking about humidifiers

1101
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:42,469
and then Buster is now that he's now

1102
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,540
that he's flooded this room and seen

1103
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:45,619
what the plants did now he's spraying

1104
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:47,929
his wall

1105
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:50,960
and spraying the floor down with water

1106
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:53,809
to get the room to stay high humidity I

1107
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,429
mean he's running his hose in front of

1108
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:57,969
oscillating wall fans and letting the

1109
00:46:55,429 --> 00:47:03,679
water to spray across the room it was

1110
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:05,299
absurd but then but meanwhile I'm mr.

1111
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,489
powder mildew you can give me any strain

1112
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,570
and I'll probably get powdery mildew on

1113
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:13,699
it and I can Buster you know he's had

1114
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:15,230
trouble getting his plants to root

1115
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:17,210
really well and stuff and I was pretty

1116
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:20,389
good at that so I was giving him plants

1117
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,699
for his grow and I would often give him

1118
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:25,690
these plants but by the time he got on

1119
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:27,949
there covered in powder mildew and and

1120
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,500
then they would go to his place and

1121
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:32,750
within a week or so all that mule due

1122
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:36,469
had turned like grayish Brown was gone

1123
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:38,179
and so we started learning well I didn't

1124
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:39,589
it's funny because Buster was working

1125
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:41,029
for me he didn't tell me at the time

1126
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,590
that he's doing his experiments because

1127
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,930
I would have said dude you're crazy stop

1128
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:46,610
it but meanwhile he's doing these

1129
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:48,109
experiments and I started to notice I

1130
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,250
was like hey what's going on I'm giving

1131
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:51,260
you a powder Millie plants and the

1132
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,699
powdery mildews going away and I think I

1133
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,230
walked into one of his rooms without

1134
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:56,239
telling him once and I felt the humidity

1135
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,340
I'm like what are you doing he explained

1136
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,289
it and claimed swamp mode we started to

1137
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,539
put it together that by running really

1138
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:04,639
high humidity we were able to get rid of

1139
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:07,009
Tyler mildew which was just that blue it

1140
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:10,159
was blowing our mind and meanwhile Jaya

1141
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:13,400
is explaining what VPD is and how a

1142
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:15,230
measure of BPD is a way to kind of talk

1143
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,670
about what we're experiencing here with

1144
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:20,119
the relationship of temperature to

1145
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:23,869
humidity so now Jaya gets with

1146
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:25,519
humidifiers and little you know whatever

1147
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:27,469
we call them a controller for the

1148
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,840
humidifiers and we started experimenting

1149
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:33,139
with humidifiers and so over the next

1150
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,240
couple of years we would we got some

1151
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:37,819
over some big numbers some big quality

1152
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:40,069
we also push the limit too and rotted

1153
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:44,600
out almost entire crops running to high

1154
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:49,309
humidity but this began kind of the the

1155
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:51,319
journey of understanding BPD and how to

1156
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:53,809
experiment with it and then eventually

1157
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,660
now we've actually got some some

1158
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:58,840
theories that we stick to yeah you would

1159
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:01,690
asked about a VPD chart

1160
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,970
I I have a have an Instagram screenshot

1161
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,190
vijaya sent me of a VPD chart I'm not

1162
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:09,279
even sure whose chart it is but it's um

1163
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:12,450
it's another living soils grower we've

1164
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:16,240
noticed that other living soils growers

1165
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:19,629
are using VPD ranges that are right in

1166
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:22,629
line with us so there there isn't

1167
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:24,640
necessarily like a VPD range for

1168
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,619
cannabis it's really kind of based on

1169
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,480
the opinion of the grower I would say

1170
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:29,980
because you see VPD charts and you're

1171
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,019
like oh my gosh I would never do that

1172
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,550
and then we've got this chart that were

1173
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:35,170
that we're looking at right now that

1174
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:37,570
really goes along with what we're

1175
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:41,470
finding so I'll send you that chart that

1176
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:45,370
you have it but ok it's uh it's like VPD

1177
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:47,259
levels in veg I think in the upper 8 to

1178
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:49,480
9 you know somewhere around there and

1179
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,000
then flower we start to dry it out a

1180
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,889
little bit more and the VPD level comes

1181
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,079
up a bit like maybe a point and a little

1182
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:58,539
over a point somewhere in there so I

1183
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:03,309
would say that's on the wetter side of

1184
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:07,630
what cannabis growers somewhat agree on

1185
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:11,619
as VPD ranges for cannabis but let me

1186
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:15,519
say this the when you when you give them

1187
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:18,789
low VPD you get some of the some of the

1188
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:21,159
most some of the fastest growth you've

1189
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:24,340
ever seen but when you get into those

1190
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:26,409
VPD ranges you're also you're also in

1191
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,120
the territory that mold and mildew also

1192
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:30,339
really likes so you start to find a

1193
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:32,889
balance of where the plants really

1194
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,380
healthy but also the mold and mildew

1195
00:50:32,889 --> 00:50:38,019
just can't really take ahold and what

1196
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,490
I've recently discovered which once

1197
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:41,340
again talking about it makes it seem

1198
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:45,639
kind of like it should have been obvious

1199
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:47,950
but your VPP is a relationship of

1200
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:50,049
temperature to humidity so let's say

1201
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:51,369
we're achieving this VPD number we want

1202
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:53,530
to achieve this VPD number during the

1203
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:54,940
day well if your humidity if your

1204
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:58,330
temperature is dropping in your room

1205
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,950
five six degrees at night your humidity

1206
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:02,259
needs to drop an appropriate level to

1207
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:03,879
achieve that same VPD so this is

1208
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,490
something that I've discovered in the

1209
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,980
last year here and started switching out

1210
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:12,489
all my control today night controls so

1211
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:14,858
we now pull the humidity down at night

1212
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:19,058
in direct relationship to temperature

1213
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:20,259
and that really helped that really

1214
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:22,150
helped with the last little bit of

1215
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,880
powder mildew I thought I was I thought

1216
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:27,849
I had graduated powder ability master's

1217
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,010
class here a little while back and it

1218
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:33,430
came back and schooled me again and

1219
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:35,079
that's when I learned about this running

1220
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:36,848
lower humidity at night which is things

1221
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:42,089
real obvious now but at the time it

1222
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:44,230
wasn't and and now we once again are

1223
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:46,298
knock on wood we are a hundred percent

1224
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:48,608
powdery mildew free without you know we

1225
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:51,278
don't do any sulfur burning or

1226
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:54,429
vaporizing and we spray a real minimum

1227
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:55,838
of sprays and you can just tell by

1228
00:51:54,429 --> 00:51:57,909
looking at the plant you know when

1229
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:00,308
you're getting the in the VPD range that

1230
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:03,338
you want to be in you just see these big

1231
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:06,700
glossy dark green beautiful waxy leaves

1232
00:52:03,338 --> 00:52:10,000
and that's also directly related to how

1233
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:12,848
dialed in your blue mat system is like

1234
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,760
you can I can go into a room and look at

1235
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:16,900
the size of the leaves and tell you

1236
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,789
whether there's automated watering

1237
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,440
system or not well let's talk a little

1238
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:23,289
bit about blue mats since you brought it

1239
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,519
up I know with the rolling tables you

1240
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:27,339
had to be a little more creative with

1241
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:29,079
your solutions there because the the

1242
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:32,409
lines aren't staying still and then you

1243
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:34,599
also I was just up there and I didn't

1244
00:52:32,409 --> 00:52:37,149
realize how much you like the protective

1245
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:38,920
caps that go over the sensors for people

1246
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:42,028
unfamiliar with blue mats you know I've

1247
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:45,789
done a few podcasts on them already and

1248
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:47,710
Ben Higgins who I just interviewed he's

1249
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:50,559
working we have the results from a

1250
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:52,269
recent trial on blue mats versus some

1251
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,460
hand watering in the goldleaf facility

1252
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:56,380
that we're hoping to put out soon but

1253
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,059
what are your experiences with them and

1254
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:00,700
sort of how did you design your setup

1255
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:05,019
okay let me let me back it up just a

1256
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:07,088
little bit so Jaya's got a grow in

1257
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:09,900
seattle and i'm back up in arlington

1258
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:12,219
we've we've we've already done our

1259
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,858
communal project together an hour on our

1260
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:16,358
own and i'm going to visiting his bean

1261
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,818
and checking it out and I'm a total

1262
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:21,969
stoner I'm a cannabis lover consumer to

1263
00:53:18,818 --> 00:53:23,829
the core and Jaya is a look not so much

1264
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:26,239
little lighter weight he's just more

1265
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:27,920
passionate about growing plants when

1266
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,409
culture and organic methods and all that

1267
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,670
so anyways I'm going to his house and

1268
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:33,319
I'm looking in his basement you've got

1269
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:37,159
some stuff hanging up in there I'm just

1270
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:39,289
blown away the trichomes are huge and

1271
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:41,149
the leaves are huge they are so

1272
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:44,029
beautiful I can't grow cannabis that

1273
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:45,320
looks like that and he's just all casual

1274
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,820
and nonchalant like oh yeah I was

1275
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,200
trained annealed very well I'm over it

1276
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:50,210
and I'm just blown away it was cookies

1277
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:54,259
and cream I'm just so blown away and

1278
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:56,090
that that's what ultimately got me to do

1279
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,160
blue Matt I'd already had a blue meth

1280
00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:00,680
system purchased and a lot of it was

1281
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:03,049
built I just hadn't put it in yet I was

1282
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:04,879
mainly after it just to free up my time

1283
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:09,740
so I didn't have to hand water anymore I

1284
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:11,930
had no idea that when you especially

1285
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:14,269
with your soil when when you automate

1286
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:20,089
the watering on that soil you unlock it

1287
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:22,610
it's absolutely incredible so I at that

1288
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:26,380
point from that point on is when I just

1289
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:30,710
became a huge proponent of blue mat and

1290
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:33,079
yeah and also another thing when I blue

1291
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:35,720
matted my first set up and this is

1292
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:37,880
pretty common had it all set up and had

1293
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:39,939
some of it was over watering some of the

1294
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,380
drippers were definitely over watering

1295
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:45,559
but Jay and I noticed those were always

1296
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:48,230
the biggest plants in the room so and

1297
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:50,480
that's when Jaya taught me that nitrogen

1298
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,920
is up take about when it's in solution

1299
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,199
basically when it's in wet so if your

1300
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,150
hand watering all the time and your

1301
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:58,189
plants are drying out they're not able

1302
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:00,079
to uptake those nutrients at that point

1303
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:03,380
when they're dry so you're literally not

1304
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,090
glowing and then yeah like I was saying

1305
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,590
we would we would get these plants that

1306
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,880
would be much bigger than the rest of

1307
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,320
the plants when they're over watering

1308
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,108
and that's when we started experimenting

1309
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:17,480
with with with running the blue Matt's

1310
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:19,670
become even wetter excuse me so the like

1311
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,230
the blue Matt moisture probe measures an

1312
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:27,500
EM bar so zero would be sitting in a cup

1313
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:31,659
of water over 200 is I think that's a

1314
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:33,469
wilting plant 80 to 120 m bar is

1315
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:37,789
recommended for cannabis and that's

1316
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:40,129
where we started but now we adjust it to

1317
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:41,960
where we're down to like

1318
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:44,599
forty to sixty and sometimes even a

1319
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,880
little lower than forty and that's where

1320
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:50,929
we're getting just the most rapid growth

1321
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,780
and and helps it seems like oh wow I

1322
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:55,190
didn't even know you were doing that

1323
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:58,460
actually what I've seen for cannabis is

1324
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:00,679
is 140 to 160 I think range they

1325
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,960
actually liked a little dryer holy hell

1326
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:05,960
oh yeah that's but you got to figure it

1327
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,760
depends on the media too so yeah you

1328
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,289
know that's that's a factor I so I think

1329
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,610
for like cocoa growers and things like

1330
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:12,320
that they actually wanted a little bit

1331
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:14,599
dryer I don't really know cuz that's not

1332
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,010
my my area of expertise either but I

1333
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:22,029
didn't I had no idea you were getting

1334
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:26,110
that wet either in those beds yeah so

1335
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:29,300
moving into the big wreck farm up there

1336
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:31,430
we were doing blue mat and we were

1337
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:35,390
running dripper chains off of a sensor

1338
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:39,919
so one sensor would would give us a zone

1339
00:56:35,389 --> 00:56:41,719
that was about two feet wide by maybe 16

1340
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,280
inches long or something like that a

1341
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:45,859
little down five drippers and you have

1342
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,830
to it and yeah you have to build those

1343
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:50,809
little dripper chains well setting up

1344
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:53,590
the REC farm jaya told me all about the

1345
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:56,570
what's it called IRRI grow the drip tape

1346
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:59,510
so instead of a chain of drippers have

1347
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:01,640
five dripper chain now we can run 12 and

1348
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:04,970
a half feet of air broke off of one

1349
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:07,789
sensor so now our zone is like god it's

1350
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:09,769
almost four feet long by 2 feet wide so

1351
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:11,420
we have 10 sensors in one of those big

1352
00:57:09,769 --> 00:57:14,289
giant beds which normally we have like

1353
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:16,930
20 or something so much easier to set up

1354
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:19,429
and it looks like it water's better

1355
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:21,469
instead of a dripper emitting a little

1356
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:24,319
circular watering mark and having five

1357
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:27,409
of those now we have this big snake of

1358
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:31,550
drip tape leaving a nice big wet swath

1359
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:33,889
right there yeah and then yeah you

1360
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,660
mentioned the little cap so if you're

1361
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:37,730
familiar with blue mass there's a sensor

1362
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:39,109
that sensor has a dial on the top of it

1363
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,480
and that is your primary source of

1364
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:43,789
adjustment that is it and those

1365
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,059
adjustments are critical and what we

1366
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:49,070
found at the REC farm was well we

1367
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:50,599
discovered this a while back but it

1368
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:52,340
wasn't an issue until the REC farm is

1369
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,069
that you come in and do a big prune a

1370
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:57,470
crew comes into the prune

1371
00:57:54,070 --> 00:58:00,250
they are likely to knock one of those

1372
00:57:57,469 --> 00:58:02,719
little one of those little sensors

1373
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:05,929
adjusters at the top and then the next

1374
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:08,509
morning show up and got a LIGO flood so

1375
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:09,980
we got all the little protective caps

1376
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,000
from blue mat I didn't know that they

1377
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:14,358
made that

1378
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,088
and we popped them on and they popped on

1379
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:18,348
so aggressively that it caused often you

1380
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:19,549
have to come and make little minor

1381
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:21,500
adjustments to your blue mask if

1382
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,030
someone's was set up and so we've come

1383
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,769
in to make an adjustment and we couldn't

1384
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:26,599
get a cap off the sensor so we would

1385
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:28,579
totally disrupt the sensor which is not

1386
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:31,849
good you want the sensor planted in the

1387
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:35,299
soil and very stationary so we just took

1388
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:37,880
a utility knives and we scraped off the

1389
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:41,089
nubs on those little caps and that did

1390
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,500
it that's perfect and now can we go

1391
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:45,019
through we digest the whole system we

1392
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,909
put all those caps on and with the

1393
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:49,519
exception it's a minor adjustment

1394
00:58:46,909 --> 00:58:52,639
we're good for two months of production

1395
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:55,759
there it's it's amazing and you probably

1396
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:58,730
saw our bed we have them plumbed out to

1397
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,849
a like a little one and a half gallon

1398
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:04,070
bucket or something like that so we

1399
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:07,970
don't have much buffer capacity for a

1400
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:09,619
for a leak and I've got some of the best

1401
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:11,419
flood stories I feel like of anybody

1402
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:12,950
including that wreck farm I tried a new

1403
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:15,170
blue mat product it was a little

1404
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,639
quick-release thing and they blew off in

1405
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:19,430
the night and I had an eight millimeter

1406
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:20,960
lime dumping water in the facility all

1407
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:23,179
weekend long it's the biggest blood I've

1408
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,889
ever seen I calculated like it's like

1409
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:30,429
3,000 gallons or something I got some

1410
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:34,039
good videos I'll show you yeah that the

1411
00:59:30,429 --> 00:59:36,139
beds roll quite a bit I decide so I

1412
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:37,429
mounted all the blue mat the ceiling

1413
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,480
that's always the way I like to do it

1414
00:59:37,429 --> 00:59:40,909
and then you drop it down off the

1415
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,490
ceiling I like to run the poly for all

1416
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:45,019
the long runs and then run the silicon

1417
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:46,669
for anywhere that we have to touch it

1418
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:47,088
regularly cuz it's really nice to work

1419
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,550
with

1420
00:59:47,088 --> 00:59:50,900
so all those main lines run across the

1421
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:53,450
ceiling and then drop down to the bed

1422
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,070
and then I just made I made their line

1423
00:59:53,449 --> 00:59:58,879
long enough that the bed could move

1424
00:59:55,070 --> 01:00:01,789
about four feet in each direction yeah

1425
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,619
yeah that's great and then so you're

1426
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:06,079
putting that in right after you

1427
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:07,880
transplant you're flowering crop in and

1428
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,880
you're kind of cleaning them and

1429
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:14,028
and re re soaking the sensors or

1430
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,910
refilling them right before yep

1431
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:18,679
I used to be lazy and I would just take

1432
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:20,389
a sensor out of one crop and throw it

1433
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:23,989
right back into the room the next time

1434
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:25,848
and it just doesn't work like that

1435
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:28,670
they lose a little bit of water inside

1436
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:30,829
of them so you really do need to clean

1437
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:32,778
them out and pop them back off every

1438
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:34,759
single time and if you do that

1439
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:38,449
they will work perfectly every single

1440
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:39,829
time and Jaya really he really did all

1441
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:42,228
the ground work on the blue net figured

1442
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:44,239
it out and made it super easy for me to

1443
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:46,998
come in and just put it into place on a

1444
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,710
real large system yeah and then one

1445
01:00:46,998 --> 01:00:50,778
other thing I wanted to touch on really

1446
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,210
quick is your trellising your beds and

1447
01:00:50,778 --> 01:00:55,369
pruning them pretty aggressively at

1448
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:57,829
least to maintain your canopy at a

1449
01:00:55,369 --> 01:01:04,338
certain height can you talk a little bit

1450
01:00:57,829 --> 01:01:07,400
about the the trellis process yeah a lot

1451
01:01:04,338 --> 01:01:08,960
of growers do staking which is very fun

1452
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,028
I mean no matter how you're trying to

1453
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,619
support your plants that's won't it's

1454
01:01:11,028 --> 01:01:15,289
very frustrating and difficult to do

1455
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:16,460
because of the just the the difficulty

1456
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:21,680
and the scale of it

1457
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:23,389
so our beds have vertical I call them

1458
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:27,348
pickets just it's a vertical post that's

1459
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:30,650
designed in the bed and those are about

1460
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:33,859
every every five feet and that just

1461
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:36,200
helps support the trellis net and so we

1462
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:38,568
on a like a shorter strain to a

1463
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:40,699
medium-sized plant will do two layers of

1464
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:41,960
trellis an initial layer to train them

1465
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:44,419
with and kind of spread them out and

1466
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,009
then that second layer on a trellis net

1467
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:48,769
is going to support all the buds from

1468
01:01:46,009 --> 01:01:52,009
literally falling over and then our

1469
01:01:48,768 --> 01:01:54,498
taller streams we we have to put a third

1470
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:56,059
row and in there but with the with the

1471
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:58,338
vertical posts already there it makes it

1472
01:01:56,059 --> 01:02:01,579
real easy just slide the net down we

1473
01:01:58,338 --> 01:02:05,119
like the big grid six inch grid and we

1474
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:08,059
the via cloth the woven stuff a lot of

1475
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,710
people like the monofilament stuff we

1476
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:11,869
reuse ours over and over and over we

1477
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:14,239
don't cut them try not to at least and

1478
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:16,190
that's huge that makes it great so the

1479
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,389
buds are all they will grow right into

1480
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,028
that net and they're supported all the

1481
01:02:17,389 --> 01:02:21,420
way to the end and so as you know the

1482
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,860
beds roll so

1483
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,599
sometimes you roll them and they hit

1484
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,400
another bed kind of hard plants are all

1485
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,259
moving around but they're all supported

1486
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,789
in the trellis net I can come in there

1487
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,260
with the DRAM and spray them really

1488
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:33,960
aggressively and I don't have to worry

1489
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,560
about anything falling over it works

1490
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,659
really well

1491
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,130
you mentioned the DRAM sprayer I know

1492
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:43,079
you have a favorite you want to share

1493
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:45,630
that yeah the DRAM BP 4 which is just it

1494
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:48,869
means 4 gallon backpack sprayer but DRAM

1495
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:50,820
make an incredible sprayer we were

1496
01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:54,000
turned on to it by another grower that

1497
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:57,780
we met through you who's a very skilled

1498
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,150
and he he recommended it to Vijaya and I

1499
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,400
and we got ourselves some drams and were

1500
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:05,070
so blown away I was just talking to you

1501
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,619
earlier about it but you get the DRAM

1502
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:10,350
and then you need to get this at

1503
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:12,599
aftermarket Lance for it it's

1504
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:16,710
telescoping and has five heads on it

1505
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:18,569
that atomized the water so with that

1506
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,550
DRAM and that telescoping Lance I mean

1507
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:22,890
you could spray a fruit tree and an

1508
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:25,410
orchard with it it's incredible you can

1509
01:03:22,889 --> 01:03:28,500
go through a room like one of mine and I

1510
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:30,449
can like my big room generally takes at

1511
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:34,079
least eight gallons was to spray it so

1512
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:36,569
to to backpack loads and I can do it in

1513
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,099
about probably 45 15 minutes or

1514
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:41,430
something and that's moving all the beds

1515
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:44,429
myself too so the DRAM with that with

1516
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:46,079
that atomizing Lance you can really

1517
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:49,079
effectively spray with a backpack

1518
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,819
sprayer we experimented around with some

1519
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,420
other what an atomizer like a stationary

1520
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,600
atomizer

1521
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,159
I think anybody's use one of those knows

1522
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,230
below it Doug Fir tree over with one of

1523
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,119
those things the DRAM was just just

1524
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:01,530
right yeah and you wouldn't want to use

1525
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:02,789
that for compost tea I just want to

1526
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:05,310
throw that out there for listeners just

1527
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:07,469
in case because that will damage the

1528
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:09,389
microorganisms but for a lot of your

1529
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:12,179
other sprays where you want a smaller

1530
01:04:09,389 --> 01:04:15,359
droplet and really good coverage that

1531
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:16,919
it's a great sprayer yeah yeah you don't

1532
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,410
want to run anything through there that

1533
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,170
has particulates in it so those little

1534
01:04:19,409 --> 01:04:24,420
atomizing heads they can only they can

1535
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:27,329
only take you know a pretty really small

1536
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:29,880
particle yeah so I I know we haven't

1537
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:32,340
even talked about legit north really as

1538
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,160
a as a company do you want to talk a

1539
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,450
little bit about about you guys and and

1540
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:40,440
where you're where you're going to the

1541
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:44,039
future anything like that yeah yeah I I

1542
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,900
was a medical grower from from from the

1543
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:52,079
very beginning right through to the very

1544
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:54,150
end and I just I kept on growing I was

1545
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,039
hoping to get into wrecks like a lot of

1546
01:04:54,150 --> 01:05:01,440
people but also heard a lot of horror

1547
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:05,159
stories too and me personally I'm a very

1548
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:10,530
accomplished builder contractor grower

1549
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:14,609
but that's it and to have a rec company

1550
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:16,560
and brand you need the whole you need

1551
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,630
the whole thing you need everybody and

1552
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,469
all these key roles so I kind of didn't

1553
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:26,250
think I was gonna get into rec and long

1554
01:05:22,469 --> 01:05:29,269
story short one of my my main guy who

1555
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:32,969
works for me one of his best friends

1556
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:34,829
happened to work for who is now one of

1557
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:36,539
my partners at this big machine shop

1558
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:40,409
which is across the street from my house

1559
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:42,119
which is funny unrelated and this guy

1560
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:44,399
was a part of legit

1561
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:45,750
he's one of the founders of legit or I'm

1562
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,940
sorry he's one of the one of the owners

1563
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:54,480
of legit it's the two founders are from

1564
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:55,889
Oak Harbor and he basically he just put

1565
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,750
he just put in a word with this guy and

1566
01:05:55,889 --> 01:05:59,219
said hey I know these guys that grow

1567
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,489
some really amazing stuff and they're

1568
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:05,369
looking to get into rec and it just so

1569
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:07,679
happened that the legit team they had a

1570
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:10,259
farm up in Burlington the farm that

1571
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,239
you've been to that I know have they had

1572
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:14,070
that license they had that site they had

1573
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:14,879
it all secured but they weren't able to

1574
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:17,700
get it going

1575
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,950
they had to move to Raymond because just

1576
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,359
because of laws and at the very

1577
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:23,519
beginning of rec it was it was hard

1578
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,950
getting getting local municipalities to

1579
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:28,519
get you off the ground so anyways they

1580
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:30,869
had this farm up there and they were

1581
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:33,449
they weren't really able to use it so I

1582
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:36,509
got invited in to to bring my whole

1583
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:38,339
system and crew and set up in that and

1584
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:43,590
the old egg farm up in Burlington there

1585
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:48,210
and and they made me a full owner with

1586
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:50,010
them and so it was all very

1587
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:53,130
it was great the way it all the way it

1588
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:54,780
all played out and the guys that it's a

1589
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:58,250
it's a great group of guys there's five

1590
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:02,849
of us and we're all local Northwest guys

1591
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:05,969
and we are we're owner funded we run our

1592
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:08,010
own Grove it's all of that right there

1593
01:07:05,969 --> 01:07:11,459
and these guys

1594
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:12,599
I love joking and saying that I'm the

1595
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,970
drummer of this band

1596
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:18,119
I'm also the most recent person to join

1597
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:19,919
with them so they already had you know a

1598
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:23,309
whole brand and a whole company built

1599
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:27,298
and they did it all around a pre-roll a

1600
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:29,010
pre-roll joint they were they were

1601
01:07:27,298 --> 01:07:30,449
really unimpressed by the pre-roll on

1602
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:32,849
the market and had the idea to make this

1603
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:34,618
infused pre-roll but unlike a lot of

1604
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:37,740
other companies they decided to make it

1605
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,000
with premium indoor bud I mean from top

1606
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:40,409
of the plant to the bottom of the plant

1607
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,150
all the best stuff goes straight into

1608
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:44,039
the joint and so that's what they were

1609
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:46,410
doing when I met him and they were just

1610
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:49,099
starting to gain some traction and by

1611
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:52,529
the time I got the burlington farm built

1612
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:53,789
the brand was really was really getting

1613
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,470
off the ground and they were ready for

1614
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:58,679
all the product that i was able to grow

1615
01:07:55,469 --> 01:08:00,868
up there so that marriage just came

1616
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:03,298
together really really well and they've

1617
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:06,030
been taking good care of me and yeah the

1618
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:07,829
rest is kind of history it's a it's a

1619
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:10,109
tough battle in the rec world it's

1620
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:12,660
nothing like the medical babes or the

1621
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:14,818
good old days it's it's all about your

1622
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:16,829
team and it's kind of an endurance run

1623
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:20,189
and how deep your pockets are and all

1624
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:22,079
that but I'm really really happy to have

1625
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:24,088
a family with these guys and they do all

1626
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:25,920
the stuff that I do not know how to do

1627
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:28,229
so there's another grower and there's

1628
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,960
another farm but it's the two farms and

1629
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:33,448
the wholesale team that does everything

1630
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,149
yeah I had one last question for you

1631
01:08:33,448 --> 01:08:38,099
that I forgot to ask I realized and it

1632
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:41,369
was around the idea of amending the soil

1633
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:43,140
and soil testing so as you mentioned at

1634
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:47,429
one point you'd use soil for up to seven

1635
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:50,160
years by recycling it what's your what's

1636
01:08:47,429 --> 01:08:53,940
your current way of amending the soil

1637
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:56,068
right now in terms of how how are you

1638
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:58,108
are you digging out the beds are you top

1639
01:08:56,069 --> 01:09:00,100
dressing are you doing any sort of

1640
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:02,470
fertility besides on

1641
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:06,760
the blue mats there he talked a little

1642
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:09,070
bit about that yeah we we used to just

1643
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:11,859
kind of just throw nutrient packs at

1644
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:15,219
your soil and we had just varying rates

1645
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:18,280
that we felt were effective and then and

1646
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:22,320
then Jaya got us using your fungal

1647
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:25,059
compost and the holy mountain compost as

1648
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:29,259
biological inoculant I guess you know to

1649
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:32,650
keep the diversity there and we did

1650
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:34,690
pretty well with that for a while but

1651
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:37,119
now getting up into the rec farm and

1652
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:40,210
where I can really focus and get soil

1653
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,739
tests on every room oh sorry actually I

1654
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:45,789
want to back up a little bit for a while

1655
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:47,439
we were doing more of a top dressing not

1656
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:50,619
necessarily top dressing we called it a

1657
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:52,210
the cobbled 1/2 turn we would we would

1658
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:56,019
use the same amendments which is your

1659
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:59,739
nutrient pack of perlite two different

1660
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:02,800
types of compost we'd mix all that in

1661
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:04,899
but we would only till the bed halfway

1662
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,230
down and we were leaving what we were

1663
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:10,359
calling just a biology layer down low

1664
01:10:07,229 --> 01:10:12,519
and we quit doing that when we got the

1665
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:14,679
root-knot nematode because because the

1666
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,270
nematode is inside the roots any root

1667
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,480
and leave in the bed you potentially

1668
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:21,550
leave live nematode in there so we quit

1669
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:25,079
doing that and we till the beds all the

1670
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:25,079
way down all of it at the bottom and

1671
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:33,609
yeah two types of compost and the

1672
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:36,250
nutrient pack we we've been getting the

1673
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:37,869
soil test and I spend them all to you

1674
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:40,029
because I don't know how to look at the

1675
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:42,039
photo desk and you've been recommending

1676
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:45,989
different things you've cut our calcium

1677
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:49,689
inputs and now our phosphorus too and

1678
01:10:45,989 --> 01:10:52,989
we're just we're kind of a we're trying

1679
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:55,809
whatever you'll tell us we uh we're

1680
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:58,019
right now our issue is our pH is high

1681
01:10:55,810 --> 01:11:01,090
right so we're trying to get that down

1682
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,690
we had some success with with a sulfate

1683
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,319
of potash

1684
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:07,949
yeah the potassium sulfate was something

1685
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:10,840
that was useful when you had a deficient

1686
01:11:07,949 --> 01:11:12,519
aciem deficiency and one of the things i

1687
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,420
found with the the may like three tests

1688
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,920
is that

1689
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:16,930
so when you start hitting what they're

1690
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,789
saying target range for potassium it

1691
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:20,680
means you're low so you actually want to

1692
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:22,750
be above that in my experience and so

1693
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,460
what you buy you adding in the potassium

1694
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,010
sulfate was just the fastest way to get

1695
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:29,380
the potassium levels back up and I think

1696
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:31,510
you commented that you saw quite a quite

1697
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:34,630
a difference with that application that

1698
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:38,380
you did yeah we did we really did I

1699
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:40,119
didn't really know how does I just I

1700
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:43,150
kind of had to guess on an amount to use

1701
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:44,769
and we really lucked out because you

1702
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:46,210
said according to that soil test that we

1703
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:47,560
hit the level pretty appropriate but

1704
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:49,420
yeah we applied that and it seemed like

1705
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,850
a matter of days when we had a major

1706
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:53,649
rapid growth but that was also at the

1707
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:56,350
same time when I was dumping too much

1708
01:11:53,649 --> 01:11:58,989
co2 at the wrong times too so all that

1709
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:00,280
rapid growth was really neat at the

1710
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:01,719
beginning and then it created the

1711
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:03,399
problem down the road and you tease me

1712
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,130
about this how I'm always telling you I

1713
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:08,500
got the best coffee and you don't hear

1714
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:09,279
from me in it it didn't finish and got

1715
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,710
too tall

1716
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,210
yeah no I mean that's great I appreciate

1717
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:14,500
you being sort of that guinea pig in a

1718
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:16,869
lot of ways throughout the years and

1719
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,340
helping me learn and have a facility

1720
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:20,260
that I can work with hand in hand and

1721
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,880
making these improvements and yeah you

1722
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,780
mentioned the agricultural sulfur we're

1723
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,810
trying to figure out how to lower your

1724
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:29,170
pH a little bit right it's it's

1725
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:31,090
constantly a process and you know I'm

1726
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:32,470
sure some people will listen to this and

1727
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:34,409
be like man what are these guys doing

1728
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:37,090
because you're sharing some of the like

1729
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:38,829
mistakes and vulnerabilities and things

1730
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:40,960
but I think that's how we learn as a

1731
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:42,909
communities is you know not everything

1732
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,970
is a textbook and not everything is a

1733
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:47,409
research lab and you kind of do have to

1734
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:49,030
figure out some things in the field and

1735
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:52,119
figure out what works for you and your

1736
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:53,649
facility and yeah I appreciate you

1737
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:57,640
sharing some of that you know it's oh

1738
01:12:53,649 --> 01:13:00,699
man yeah absolutely I I couldn't have

1739
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:03,340
gotten to where I am without a whole

1740
01:13:00,699 --> 01:13:05,409
bunch of people all doing this together

1741
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:07,900
and all sharing every single thing we

1742
01:13:05,409 --> 01:13:11,109
found you know giant and Buster and you

1743
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:14,319
I mean you and Jaya I feel are the the

1744
01:13:11,109 --> 01:13:16,719
innovators and I'm the person who gets

1745
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:19,989
the who gets the wonderful honor of

1746
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:21,820
putting it into action and yeah I mean

1747
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:24,460
and I want to say also like right now

1748
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:26,500
our soil test the pH is really high and

1749
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,368
things are locked out right like if you

1750
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,960
were looking at the soil

1751
01:13:27,368 --> 01:13:30,519
you'd probably say oh you're having a

1752
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,060
little trouble but then you walk into

1753
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:36,880
the room and it's like holy moly so I I

1754
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:38,650
can't wait to when we build another room

1755
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,359
to get the new soil in there and to

1756
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:43,809
apply everything I've learned see what

1757
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:45,429
we it yeah I appreciate you being that

1758
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:47,560
guinea pig and helping us figure it out

1759
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:48,908
so uh thanks for that and thanks for

1760
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,560
coming on the podcast today to kind of

1761
01:13:48,908 --> 01:13:52,629
just talk about your experiences it's

1762
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,510
great to not only talk to an old friend

1763
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:57,609
but also get to just share you know what

1764
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:59,770
it's like in the field versus what you

1765
01:13:57,609 --> 01:14:01,839
see you know on paper or on the internet

1766
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:04,000
and and frankly social media nowadays

1767
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,110
everyone puts up all their best photos

1768
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,689
and things you don't talk about it

1769
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:10,868
according to the the internet no one has

1770
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:12,698
ever dealt with rude a foods and fungus

1771
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:13,899
gnats in the cannabis aphid and all

1772
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:16,238
these other things that are just a

1773
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:18,129
reality in like yeah almost every

1774
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:21,129
facility or grow room I visit you know

1775
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:25,300
yeah you look you learn so much when

1776
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:28,690
you're having trouble you really do and

1777
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:30,940
also you know I'm I'm always really

1778
01:14:28,689 --> 01:14:34,539
flying that flag for living soils I was

1779
01:14:30,939 --> 01:14:37,149
a I was a very classic typical grower

1780
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:39,219
when I first heard about this compost

1781
01:14:37,149 --> 01:14:43,448
soil and water only soil to me it was

1782
01:14:39,219 --> 01:14:46,179
like yeah right and now I'm so

1783
01:14:43,448 --> 01:14:48,219
passionate about it mainly because I am

1784
01:14:46,179 --> 01:14:50,199
such a cannabis lover but when you grow

1785
01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:53,020
any living soils and we've got these

1786
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:55,269
trace minerals and and and we've got the

1787
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:58,030
soil food web it's built up as we can

1788
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:00,630
and the biomes or you know diverse the

1789
01:14:58,029 --> 01:15:03,399
the product is incredible the the the

1790
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:05,949
flavor profile the terpenes the

1791
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:09,149
robustness of it just the overall health

1792
01:15:05,948 --> 01:15:11,698
and vitality the plant is incredible I

1793
01:15:09,149 --> 01:15:14,408
look forward to more and more people

1794
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:16,569
using leaving soils indoors and

1795
01:15:14,408 --> 01:15:19,658
experimenting with them because we still

1796
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:21,429
have a lot to learn and I mean we get we

1797
01:15:19,658 --> 01:15:23,679
get huge numbers and we get great test

1798
01:15:21,429 --> 01:15:26,408
scores which is I really attribute that

1799
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:29,560
to the to the soils and because you only

1800
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:31,960
need to add water you can use glue mat I

1801
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:34,270
feel like it's that one of the most

1802
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,368
brilliant watering systems ever created

1803
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:40,070
it's so amazing it works so well it's so

1804
01:15:36,368 --> 01:15:41,359
consistent it's so reliable yeah look

1805
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:45,078
let's get more people involved so they

1806
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:46,368
can figure out how to amend it yeah and

1807
01:15:45,078 --> 01:15:48,259
we are and we are constantly learning

1808
01:15:46,368 --> 01:15:50,238
that side of things and it's funny

1809
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,800
brought that up I just wanted one last

1810
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:55,428
act out I was I was talking to a guy

1811
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,380
yesterday out of Canada and he had a lot

1812
01:15:55,429 --> 01:16:00,349
of experience growing in cocoa and wants

1813
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:02,868
to be organic but it's getting really

1814
01:16:00,349 --> 01:16:07,270
really good yields using you know an A

1815
01:16:02,868 --> 01:16:12,789
and B part to part with cocoa and his

1816
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:14,630
small containers automated irrigation

1817
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:17,179
wants more of a pharmaceutical

1818
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:19,310
environment for his for his growing

1819
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:20,658
operations or his facilities and we're

1820
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:23,150
talking about pretty large scale here

1821
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:26,719
and as we were talking I was like you

1822
01:16:23,149 --> 01:16:27,948
know I'm obviously a if anyone who's

1823
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,569
listening this podcast who knows me

1824
01:16:27,948 --> 01:16:30,049
knows I'm an organic guy that's my

1825
01:16:29,569 --> 01:16:33,559
passion

1826
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:35,480
you as well but it was hard for me to

1827
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,310
try and persuade this guy that he should

1828
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:39,439
switch over to living soils when he's

1829
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:43,010
having the success he is looking at more

1830
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:44,388
as you know a sterile environment and

1831
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:46,310
something that's very easy to replicate

1832
01:16:44,389 --> 01:16:49,520
now yeah

1833
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:51,650
with living soils yes we are saving a

1834
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,949
lot of labor with the watering and with

1835
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:56,179
the with the fact we're not moving as

1836
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:57,408
much material in and out of our

1837
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:59,210
facilities so it's a lot more

1838
01:16:57,408 --> 01:17:01,098
environmentally and sustainably friendly

1839
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:04,689
but is it

1840
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:07,250
I wouldn't necessarily it's easier and

1841
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:08,719
there is a learning curve to it you

1842
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,670
can't just expect that you're gonna

1843
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:15,078
switch over and get the same yields that

1844
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:17,270
you were growing hydro I think and you

1845
01:17:15,078 --> 01:17:19,519
know if you want to go multi multi level

1846
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:21,230
multi tier with that I think it's really

1847
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,880
challenging with the wait I haven't seen

1848
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:24,649
anyone successfully pull it off on a

1849
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,630
commercial scale so if you're trying to

1850
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:30,229
go vertical then it may not be the best

1851
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:31,730
option either so yeah it was it was fun

1852
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:33,769
to talk to the guy and I hope that they

1853
01:17:31,729 --> 01:17:35,149
you know are open to experimenting in

1854
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:37,159
fact I may try and bring him out to your

1855
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:39,469
facility sometime to show him what that

1856
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:41,988
looks like but it was it was just kind

1857
01:17:39,469 --> 01:17:43,550
of it was kind of an interesting view

1858
01:17:41,988 --> 01:17:44,959
because there are so many ways to grow

1859
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:47,029
this plant so I don't want to just say

1860
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,980
that these other ways don't work but

1861
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:50,179
that there but rather than you know for

1862
01:17:48,979 --> 01:17:51,738
you and your facility this has been

1863
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:53,579
really successful and I know others have

1864
01:17:51,738 --> 01:17:57,089
had success with it

1865
01:17:53,579 --> 01:17:59,579
because it it's not popular within the

1866
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:04,319
within the agriculture community you

1867
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:06,420
know yeah we're a huge minority yeah and

1868
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:08,189
and all the other methods are known to

1869
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:11,730
work and known to give consistent

1870
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:14,039
product inconsistent yields and for a

1871
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:14,909
really typical grower I don't want to

1872
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:16,680
say the guy you're talking to the

1873
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:19,769
typical grower but you know somebody who

1874
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:22,170
uses very typical methods to start

1875
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:23,610
talking about living soiled it's kind of

1876
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:25,649
like jumping off a cliff

1877
01:18:23,609 --> 01:18:28,049
these guys are used to sterile rooms

1878
01:18:25,649 --> 01:18:31,289
there's not a single thing flying around

1879
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:32,610
in there anything crawling and one of

1880
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:34,050
our rooms you know we've got a whole

1881
01:18:32,609 --> 01:18:36,238
bunch of beneficial insects in there

1882
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:37,800
we've we're encouraging this biology

1883
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:41,399
where they're trying to make it sterile

1884
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:43,949
so it's really a different it's getting

1885
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:46,589
used to a whole nother program but the

1886
01:18:43,948 --> 01:18:47,669
beauty of it is is when you have when

1887
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,890
you've got all of your predators

1888
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:51,239
established and stuff you can you can

1889
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:53,969
get one of these pests that will shut

1890
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:54,689
down a hydroponic facility and we can

1891
01:18:53,969 --> 01:18:56,640
take it in stride

1892
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,679
I'm not saying obviously that we're

1893
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,410
foolproof you know we've got some pest

1894
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,210
issues right now but with the living

1895
01:19:01,409 --> 01:19:07,849
soils you get a real big buffer because

1896
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:10,500
we have all the habitats there to host a

1897
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:12,870
population of beneficial that's always

1898
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,430
there it's great and every once in a

1899
01:19:12,869 --> 01:19:15,390
while we'll just we'll buy some more and

1900
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:18,150
throw them in to make sure they're doing

1901
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:20,070
well yeah well thanks again for your

1902
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:21,299
time I know you got to get he actually

1903
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:21,929
have to get out over to the farm here

1904
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,930
soon

1905
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:28,500
but I appreciate you taking time to chat

1906
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:31,560
and hopefully soon I can make it back up

1907
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:33,180
to see him yeah and I'll probably learn

1908
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,710
a bunch more in the next year so I'll

1909
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:37,409
come back on and correct a whole bunch

1910
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:39,090
of things I said all right sounds good

1911
01:19:37,409 --> 01:19:43,010
