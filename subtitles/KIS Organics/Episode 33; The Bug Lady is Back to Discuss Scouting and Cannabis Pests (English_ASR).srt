43
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,719
Suzanne reached out again because she

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,670
wanted to come back on to talk about

45
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,048
scouting and other topics that she's

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,799
noticed have been issues for many

47
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,630
cannabis growers on her farm visits just

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,460
a reminder if you are a large-scale

49
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,109
commercial cultivator and are serious

50
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,459
about consulting or setting up an

51
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:58,978
integrated pest management program

52
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:03,169
utilizing beneficial insects I can't

53
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,170
recommend her enough her website is

55

other information on the podcast page

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,740
now on to the show

57
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,560
hey Suzanne thanks for coming back on

58
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,900
the show I'm not even sure what we're

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,400
talking about today you reached out

60
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,770
saying there was a bunch of stuff you'd

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,560
come across in the last year since we

62
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,110
last chatted on on air and wanted to

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,469
share it with listeners so yeah take it

64
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,540
away

65
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,120
well first thanks for having me back

66
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,099
again and not that I forced you to have

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,710
me on but I just thought it would be a

68
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,799
good idea to come back and talk about

69
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,719
some of the things I'm seeing going on

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,900
as I travel around the country working

71
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,629
with cannabis growers of all different

72
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,129
sizes which is actually good because the

73
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,799
other podcast you've got me in touch

74
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,909
with a lot of other growers around the

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,090
country and we've had some great

76
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:08,340
discussions over some issues but the one

77
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,349
of the biggest things I'm finding when

78
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,599
I'm actually at visits when I'm

79
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,239
physically at facilities is that growers

80
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,900
really don't know how to look to find

81
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,760
their pests and to know really what's

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,090
going on and there's been a lot of

83
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,560
assumptions and a lot of guessing and

84
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,629
you know it's it's not as simple as oh

85
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,229
you can snap a quick picture throw it up

86
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,500
on Facebook and have somebody ID it

87
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:37,530
growers really need to have a good solid

88
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,629
scouting program that there's there's a

89
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,080
system to it so that they can be

90
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,759
consistent they can keep records and be

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,680
able to put together a good salt program

92
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,919
because I am seeing a lot of waste in

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,180
the sense of people are spraying when

94
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,280
they don't need to or even buying

95
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,550
biocontrol agents they don't necessarily

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,719
need or buying the wrong product for the

97
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:03,390
wrong problem out there so one of the

98
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,949
things I think that is critical is that

99
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,759
everybody's got the right tools and

100
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:10,589
their tool bag anybody that had me into

101
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,310
their facility will see I carry you know

102
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,798
I have a giant nerd bag I carry I'm not

103
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,009
quite wearing a fanny pack yet but I do

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,959
have a giant fanny pack but it is really

105
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,788
convenient I mean as much as you know

106
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,199
they could be completely nerdy it's so

107
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:26,129
convenient because you do need to have

108
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,519
your hands

109
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:31,709
free while you're out looking for pests

110
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,439
and I honestly I'm I'm really shocked

111
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,209
and surprised how many facilities I go

112
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,310
into and the people that are in charge

113
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:41,419
of finding paths don't even have a hand

114
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,060
lens just a basic 10x hand lens and

115
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,710
that's something everybody can afford

116
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,240
and that's something everybody should

117
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,939
have it actually you should have almost

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,009
all your staff or you know whomever is

119
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,480
in your facility having them so that

120
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,599
they can actually look and see what's

121
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,129
going on I think that's that's really

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,100
critical because I'm sure you carry a

123
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:04,469
hand lens right oh yeah I always carry a

124
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,490
hand lens when I go somewhere yeah there

125
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,170
you go into a growing situation of

126
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,460
course yeah no I totally agree with you

127
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,220
and there they are they're cheap you can

128
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:16,469
get them on eBay or Amazon something

129
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,330
usually under 10 bucks I got one free at

130
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,650
a trade show at the advanced nutrients

131
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:22,050
booth which is the only advanced

132
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:26,879
nutrients thing I will ever have her use

133
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:29,370
but yeah well okay I know bio best often

134
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,649
gives them away for free like at you

135
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,319
know we did that all day insect ID

136
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:38,069
workshop at cultivate a couple weeks ago

137
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,110
and I talked to Bach fest and they

138
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,389
provided hand lenses and lanyards for

139
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,379
everybody that came to the workshop so

140
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,779
they often have them sometimes BASF has

141
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,519
them and as a side little plug that's

142
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,529
like the only thing I saw on my website

143
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,819
but I'm not promoting myself at all but

144
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,769
if you can't find them or get one for

145
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,599
free I do some other website not not

146
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:59,509
necessary to make money off of them but

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,040
it's because I was tired of growers

148
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:03,599
having excusive well I can't find them

149
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,439
well now growers don't have an excuse

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,420
you know and the one I carry just

151
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,139
because I'm a little more mature in my

152
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:16,500
age than you young uns it has an LED

153
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,360
light in it so if you're in a darker

154
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,519
growing situation or if you're down into

155
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,949
the plant canopy that LED lighting there

156
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,779
actually really helps back in my my

157
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,699
youthful days when I was like 20 I could

158
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,559
actually you know see a lot of stuff

159
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,810
without hand lenses now that I'm you

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,639
know creeping up on 50 yeah that's a

161
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,620
those days are gone and having that

162
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,039
extra light in there can really help and

163
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,920
you want minimum ten

164
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,590
magnification you can get some up to

165
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,480
like 30x with just you know that the

166
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:47,089
traditional handheld loupe but they can

167
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,300
be very hard to use I think the best

168
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:52,879
thing to do is to use like a 10 maybe 15

169
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,550
X out in the field then when you find a

170
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,379
problem I like to snip a leaf put it in

171
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,620
a bag label it where it is then I take

172
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,209
it to the office or wherever you know

173
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,180
there's a desk and then is when I bring

174
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,489
out the Dynalite which again if you

175
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,189
don't own a Dynalite I don't want to

176
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,410
call you you know stupid but it is one

177
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:14,389
of the best investments you can make

178
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,870
because you can take really good

179
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:20,719
pictures with it and that way you can

180
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,000
zoom in better get more refined pictures

181
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,790
to be able to send because people

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,370
especially on Instagram you got to stop

183
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,980
sending me cell phone quick snaps on

184
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,290
instagrams you cannot zoom in on

185
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,810
pictures when you private message

186
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:39,170
somebody it's nearly impossible for me

187
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,420
to help you if you want people to help

188
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,699
you with your ID you need to get a good

189
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,879
picture with something Dynalite and then

190
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,459
email it so I can take it and I can zoom

191
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,040
in or other people can zoom in Instagram

192
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:55,159
is one of the worst social media

193
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,890
platforms for using photos for diagnosis

194
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,650
because of its lack of manipulating

195
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,439
images you know even on Facebook you can

196
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:05,209
download the image and zoom in but again

197
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,219
when you upload images you do lose

198
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,599
quality and that's why emailing is one

199
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,790
of the better ways to do it

200
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,120
texting is maybe second but again

201
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,160
because of the data compression to make

202
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,410
images smaller to save on data texting

203
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,970
alternative reduces file size and when I

204
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,860
need to get in there and look at you

205
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,380
know tiny little hairs and tiny little

206
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,199
parts you know I need to have as big as

207
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:30,860
image as you can get me and you know it

208
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,799
may seem expensive spending 150 or $300

209
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,440
on a Dynalite but if it if it saves a

210
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,478
plant or saves a couple plants you know

211
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,940
or saves you from having to buy in a

212
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,550
pesticide or even some bios it's paid

213
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,780
for itself

214
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:50,689
it's an incredibly useful tool and I

215
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:53,689
recommend that everybody have one

216
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,389
and I did dad aren't aren't you making

217
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,310
them available now yeah I followed your

218
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:00,560
recommendation I went out and got myself

219
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:03,258
a Dino light I think it was in the three

220
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,328
hundred dollar range and tried that out

221
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:08,089
and then also contacted the company and

222
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:10,939
now on our website I offer a few options

223
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,829
let's sort of a good better best from

224
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,440
what sort of they recommended and also

225
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:17,208
my conversations with you but I have to

226
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,670
say the Dynalite is great it's very easy

227
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:21,768
to use the quality of the images is

228
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:23,649
amazing we were looking at our the pores

229
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:27,139
of our skin and other things around the

230
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,909
around the house with it just because I

231
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:31,220
didn't have any bugs handy to take a

232
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:33,110
peek at but I'm excited to get it out

233
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,509
into some grow operations and actually

234
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,459
look at some insects yeah and you can

235
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:41,860
not only is it with your computers or

236
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:46,068
USB you can get like a $2 $3 connector

237
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,120
USB converter on Amazon or whomever else

238
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:50,240
and you can connect it to your

239
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,639
smartphone or your tablet and the

240
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,769
software is super easy to use you know

241
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,259
there have been precursors to this there

242
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,929
was like the IPM scope but the IPM scope

243
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:01,459
was extremely difficult to use having to

244
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:05,120
manually go into the settings of your

245
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:06,979
computer and change things to make it

246
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,600
work where I mean I think the Dynalite

247
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,379
is pretty much idiot proof it's just

248
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,709
plug and play and I use it all the time

249
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:18,740
so you know that's another thing that's

250
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:20,599
really important and so you know I

251
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,490
talked about putting things in bags you

252
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,180
know having you know little Ziploc

253
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,620
baggies to put samples in is really

254
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:29,479
important because you just don't want to

255
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,068
you know if you suspect something has a

256
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,230
problem you don't want to carry it

257
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:35,088
around through your different rooms or

258
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,879
near other plants you want to quarantine

259
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,130
it immediately because I do think that

260
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,929
one of the the big issues that's

261
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:45,139
happening in cannabis is just self

262
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,909
contamination where people you know will

263
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,948
go in in the morning and they want to go

264
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:51,198
see their pest problems and what's going

265
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,609
on and so they start in the dirtiest

266
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:54,708
part of the facility and then end up in

267
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,350
the cleanest part later in the day and

268
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:59,509
now you've just spread the problem and

269
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,240
if you're carrying around open exposed

270
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:03,860
plant cuttings you can do that so when

271
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,419
you're scouting you always want to

272
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,370
start with the cleanest part of the

273
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:10,909
facility and then work your way to the

274
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,370
dirtiest through the day and put samples

275
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:17,240
in bags I think it's good to carry

276
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,610
irrigation flags so that way if you find

277
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,200
a problem you can stick a flag in a pot

278
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,060
and that way if you do do a treatment

279
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,100
you can come back and check that exact

280
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:28,099
plant to make sure it worked it also

281
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,550
will allow other people the facility to

282
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,040
know you know if there's a problem so oh

283
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:35,809
you know this this old colored flag

284
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:37,549
means there's a mite issue so we know

285
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,750
it's here oh here we know you know

286
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,939
there's a disease issue because you've

287
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,799
got the striped flag and that will help

288
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,720
people know because if you say oh go

289
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,028
back into house to bench three and go

290
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,350
find the hem for us it mites that's

291
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:52,789
going to take somebody else a bunch of

292
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:55,220
time but if the the tags are flagged you

293
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:58,219
know that I'm so the plants are flagged

294
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,778
the plants are tagged with flags then

295
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,579
they're easy to find so that's another

296
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:03,980
critical tool to have you can also use a

297
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:05,809
flagging tape or you can come up with

298
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,009
some other system but irrigation flags

299
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,578
come in lots of colors they're

300
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:13,278
inexpensive to use and readily available

301
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:14,899
so that's another good thing I've found

302
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,970
and then I mean of course having your

303
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,100
phone with you to take overall shots

304
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,949
it's pretty important but again the

305
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,250
quality of the images for identifying

306
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:29,539
insect issues it's it's really hard and

307
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:32,179
I see a lot of people guessing on what

308
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:35,179
problems are due to these overview shots

309
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:37,489
and I you know I don't like to guess I

310
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,989
want to see actual images I want to be

311
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,259
able to count legs I want to look at

312
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,360
antennae to make sure that we're getting

313
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,819
the right diagnosis because nobody wants

314
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,430
to waste money or use an ineffective

315
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,959
treatment on that so I think you know

316
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:52,278
those kinds of things aren't pretty

317
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,099
important another thing that's not as

318
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,289
important but I again it's worth every

319
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,579
penny is you know infrared thermometer

320
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:00,860
gun to know what your temperatures

321
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:03,948
really are in your plant canopies not

322
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,389
just your air temperature and that way

323
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:09,198
when you're making decisions on

324
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:10,939
biocontrol agents you really know what

325
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,009
what kind of temperatures are running

326
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,870
inside the plants and not just in the

327
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,939
air because you can find some pretty

328
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,690
significant differences depending on

329
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,000
plant

330
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:23,270
canopy leaf size color of the plant

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,200
there's a lot of variables that are in

332
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:29,090
there when you start looking at that and

333
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,570
again it can make a difference on what

334
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:36,290
biocontrol is you're gonna select the

335
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,030
other thing that I mean it's I don't

336
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,529
know it's kind of exciting for me to

337
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:40,939
show growers this and they get so

338
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,409
excited when you show them for the first

339
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,370
time and it's so simple and it's

340
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,750
something again we've done in

341
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,870
ornamentals and vegetables for years

342
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,519
it's just to take a whiteboard I mean

343
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,529
you can even use a sheet of paper but I

344
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,720
think whiteboards work the best and just

345
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:57,319
put it next to your plant and then bang

346
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,350
your leaves on it and things like thrips

347
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,310
and might not necessarily hemp for us it

348
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,080
might have broad might because they're

349
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:05,439
too small to see with a naked eye but

350
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,970
things like - spotted spider mites

351
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,330
thrips EFA's they'll just fall out

352
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,290
because when I go into facilities and

353
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,060
people are you know

354
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:15,230
scouting they're taking a leaf and

355
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:16,489
flipping it and they're taking leave

356
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,310
from flippin a first of all that takes

357
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,169
too much time and your chances of

358
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:22,789
finding stuff's pretty slim you take

359
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:26,149
this white board you hold it up next to

360
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:28,309
the plant bang the leaves on it and

361
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:30,439
stuff falls right out because I was in

362
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:32,209
one facility recently and they were

363
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,430
flipping leaves looking for thrips and

364
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,440
couldn't find them as soon as we banged

365
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:40,219
him on a board thrips just came raining

366
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,190
out so that's an easy way that I mean

367
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:46,700
and again pretty standard practice in an

368
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:49,340
agriculture to find where the pests are

369
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,960
so I think that's you know a pretty

370
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:58,340
important tool there - to have and to

371
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:02,210
use I carry a small one in my my nerd

372
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,490
bag when I'm out in the field one of the

373
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,550
things you can also use is the lid of

374
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,440
the styrofoam cooler from the shipping

375
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:11,719
from the biocontrol agents save those

376
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,700
lids they make really good bang boards

377
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,389
out there for when you're you're

378
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:20,420
scouting now when you say a bang board

379
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:24,230
now you're talking about a relatively

380
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,819
thin piece of cardboard or wood yeah

381
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,830
that's just painted white I don't want

382
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:31,080
to picture people going out with a 2x4

383
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:33,240
trying to like hit no no it's again I'm

384
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,250
I you can use a white painter's palette

385
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,840
that's that thin white plastic you can

386
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,029
use a white and note ad but the thing

387
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,100
with no pads if your plant is wet at all

388
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,439
then you end up getting your notepad all

389
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,230
wet again the lids to the styrofoam

390
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,420
coolers you can use because it's you

391
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:53,399
know it's about a inch thick flat piece

392
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:54,870
of white styrofoam you can for smaller

393
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,879
plants you can literally pick them up

394
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,009
and bang them on the paper

395
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,840
I'll see if I've got I know I've got

396
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:02,340
some videos somewhere that maybe I can

397
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,910
send you some that you could attach

398
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,410
somehow to the podcast maybe is that

399
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:09,029
something you can do that people could

400
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:11,490
see it or maybe I should just post a

401
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:13,860
little video up on Instagram so people

402
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,750
can see it well I think people should be

403
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,220
following you on Instagram so you should

404
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,899
definitely let people know your

405
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,620
Instagram title but then on the podcast

406
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,879
page I can put up any videos or links to

407
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,220
okay alright we'll get that worked out

408
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:30,000
because it's something that it's good to

409
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,200
see how it's done and so yeah if you

410
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,620
could never get to any of my scouting

411
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,780
workshops or classes you know it's it's

412
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,789
a it's good to see it firsthand because

413
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,100
it is it's kind of hard to just explain

414
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,549
and that's what's really hard with pest

415
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,960
management just reading stuff online

416
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:50,370
oftentimes isn't enough you need to be

417
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:54,900
out doing stuff firsthand and seeing it

418
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,769
to kind of you know make it work so take

419
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,069
me through the process

420
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:01,110
after we've knocked the insects onto the

421
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,650
whiteboard the bank board and we can see

422
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,190
them there

423
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:07,440
you're then taking that and taking it

424
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:10,320
into another room to look closer at the

425
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,789
insects are you killing the insects so

426
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,829
that they can't move like with alcohol

427
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,990
or anything is there a process for that

428
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,990
and then when I go to take that picture

429
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,599
to send it to an expert what do I want

430
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,029
to make sure is included in that photo

431
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,588
okay so when I'm doing it only because

432
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:27,539
I'm old and crusty and been doing this

433
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:30,809
for a long time I can pretty much tell

434
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:32,670
really fast what they are just again it

435
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,289
just comes with experience and it's

436
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,150
something that as growers do this more

437
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,980
they'll get better you know it's easy to

438
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,340
see thrips because they're you know more

439
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,259
cigar shaped when they're running on the

440
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:45,929
board

441
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,640
oftentimes we do crush them just because

442
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,980
we don't want them going back on to the

443
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,530
plants but oftentimes to if you're using

444
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,259
biocontrol agents your predatory mites

445
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,690
can fallout aureus on my new pirate bug

446
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,009
will often find immature aureus falling

447
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,299
out and obviously those you don't want

448
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:02,039
to kill and actually you want to kind of

449
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:06,990
shake those back into the plant

450
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:09,990
if you need to collect specimens to get

451
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,150
them ID'd what you need to do is have

452
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,039
what's called an aspirator and you can

453
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,170
buy those from bio quip i think they're

454
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:20,629
about ten dollars and it's basically

455
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:23,700
like a mini bug vacuum and what you do

456
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,530
is you basically can you put one end of

457
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,730
the tube in your mouth and you suck but

458
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,680
there's a filter in there so you won't

459
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,920
suck up the bugs but it sucks the bugs

460
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,380
or mites or whatever into a vial and so

461
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,910
if you try to pick thrips ups and mites

462
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,530
up you're going to damage them and crush

463
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,360
them this way they get sucked into the

464
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:41,039
vials and you can put alcohol in there

465
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,899
and you can snap a lid on and then you

466
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,379
can send it off to get it identified and

467
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,980
once these insects and mites are off the

468
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,050
plant material you can ship dead insects

469
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,730
and alcohol to anybody across state

470
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:56,339
lines to get them identified what you

471
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,380
can't do is pluck a leaf and then ship

472
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:01,019
the plant material across state lines

473
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,530
with the insects on them and so this is

474
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:07,980
a way you can get your stuff identified

475
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:10,619
that's legal yeah that makes a lot of

476
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,750
sense so one of the things you mentioned

477
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,979
is that things like broad mites or

478
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,140
hamper acid mites you won't necessarily

479
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,410
be able to see them are those ending up

480
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,690
on that Bank board like should we have a

481
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,970
spray bottle with alcohol in it for

482
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,009
example to kill anything that we can't

483
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,009
see that may still be on there or what's

484
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:31,049
the protocol around that yeah I don't

485
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:33,119
know if I mean if you've got broad mites

486
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:37,169
or hand for us it might killing ten of

487
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:39,809
them's not gonna you know not gonna make

488
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,250
that much of a difference I wouldn't be

489
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:45,929
too worried about it

490
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:49,049
now if you are suspecting that a plant

491
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:51,509
does have you know broad mite or hemp

492
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:54,299
for us it might and you use your hand

493
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:56,999
could use your hand to bang the plant or

494
00:19:54,299 --> 00:20:00,328
even if you see spider mites before you

495
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:03,209
go to other houses or other plants I

496
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:04,709
would probably wash my hand off because

497
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:06,689
your hands going to be touching the

498
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,318
plant and we know that these very small

499
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:09,389
mites

500
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:11,519
you know since they're spread on even

501
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:13,078
the legs of insects they're spread on

502
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,288
birds feet they're spread very easily

503
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:19,858
your hand could be act as the vector to

504
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:22,769
spread these around so you could wear a

505
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:26,218
latex glove if you wanted or you could

506
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:28,199
just wash your hands between but just

507
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:31,739
you know think about that you've got to

508
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:33,329
think about em ice spreading my problems

509
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,338
around a greenhouse and a lot of times

510
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:37,828
I'm finding it people are doing it to

511
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:39,058
themselves by just you know they're

512
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:41,188
trying to treat in one area then they

513
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:44,219
spread it to another and you know having

514
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:46,709
you know wearing lab coats and booties

515
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:48,989
that you know we're not doing this to

516
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:52,318
just look like nerds you know you do

517
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:54,538
this to stop the spread of these

518
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:57,058
problems and I tell you the hem for us

519
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:59,128
in might and broad mites are a pretty

520
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:02,068
serious issue and people just keep

521
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:04,019
spreading them and having you know just

522
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:05,368
think about sanitation all the time

523
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:06,689
because a lot of these issues can be

524
00:21:05,368 --> 00:21:10,168
stopped through good sanitation

525
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:11,729
practices so yeah my thought was that

526
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,709
bang board might be a source of

527
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:16,139
contamination well but you would have to

528
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:20,519
rub yeah but you have to rub the back

529
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:21,808
board back up on to the plant and you're

530
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,078
not because the bang words not

531
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:26,608
necessarily always touching the plant

532
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:30,178
because you're smacking the plant and

533
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:31,348
knocking things to fall on to it you cut

534
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,189
your hands kind of acting like a

535
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:34,138
hurricane

536
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:36,089
smacking trees and then stuff falls out

537
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:37,558
of it and it falls on to the board now

538
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,509
at the end of the day yeah you could

539
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,858
definitely rinse it off before you you

540
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:44,399
know you put it in your office or

541
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:46,438
whatever but we've never you know

542
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:48,118
sprayed or cleaned it between every bang

543
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:50,339
because you're walking down the line and

544
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:51,838
going bang bang bang bang and you're

545
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:53,278
doing a bunch of it and if you to stop

546
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:54,749
and spray and then wait for the alcohol

547
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,148
to evaporate you're never getting

548
00:21:54,749 --> 00:22:00,118
anything done got it that makes sense so

549
00:21:57,148 --> 00:22:02,158
can you take me through a like a

550
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:04,978
traditional morning scouting routine

551
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,069
that you would want someone to do well

552
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:10,500
first when you get in you know put on

553
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:13,139
your your your work clothes

554
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,940
because you know I'm finding that

555
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,759
definitely people that have states where

556
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,620
it's legal to grow at home those growers

557
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,509
are having a lot more issues in states

558
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:24,449
where they can't because people are

559
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:28,049
bringing pests ins from pests in from

560
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,370
their their own plants at their house so

561
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:32,789
that's something you have to be well

562
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:36,839
aware of change into your air-quote you

563
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:38,789
know work clothes I'm even you know you

564
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:42,089
know you can do washable scrubs you can

565
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,200
do tie-back suits you know the people

566
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:45,750
you do lab coats there's all different

567
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,039
kinds of options you know you just have

568
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,670
to look at what works best for your

569
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,700
facility and then again start in your

570
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:56,550
cleanest room and work your way through

571
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,350
to the into the dirtiest and you know if

572
00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,990
you go into the dirtiest room and you

573
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:02,939
have to go back to the clean room you

574
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,620
know it's best if you can change your

575
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,880
lab coat or change your clothes or

576
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:08,369
change something because you don't want

577
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,160
to take the pests back in and ideally

578
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:13,469
you know your propagation area should be

579
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,240
your cleanest I'm finding that's not

580
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,519
necessarily true

581
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,380
and because of that people have a lot of

582
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,200
pests and propagation and then they just

583
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,650
keep it keeps moving with the plants all

584
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,350
the way through the plants life and the

585
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,460
the problems are spreading so again

586
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:31,980
ideally you'd want to start in the

587
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,950
cleanest room you have your hand lens

588
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,470
you have a notebook you have you know

589
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,750
your camera which is on your phone you

590
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,420
have your bank board you have some files

591
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,089
you have some bags and then you go out

592
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,430
and one thing I do suggest is that you

593
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:49,649
don't walk the same pattern each time

594
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,049
because you do see different things from

595
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,690
different angles and depending on the

596
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:56,519
size and there's a lot of variables on

597
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,580
how we come up with you know how many

598
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:02,519
plants are you going to sample you you

599
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:07,619
do that and you also and I've had to do

600
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:11,579
a lot of firmly pushing on growers

601
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:13,799
lately you need to use sticky cards and

602
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:15,990
you can't leave them up for three months

603
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:21,720
and you don't need to be paying a dollar

604
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:24,359
a sticky card that's crazy expensive I I

605
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,429
don't know why the cannabis industry is

606
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,240
just not wanting to adopt this really

607
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:32,340
easy method to know what pest you have

608
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,589
or that you have out there I'm seeing a

609
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,750
lot more thrips in cannabis that's been

610
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:40,470
the biggest thing the last month or so

611
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:43,558
and if growers had sticky cards up they

612
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,329
would know that they had thrips in there

613
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:49,740
probably before they started seeing

614
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:51,210
damage and could mount an attack also

615
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,039
leaving them up for months and months

616
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,450
and months that doesn't do any good if

617
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,099
we're talking about monitoring sticky

618
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,990
cards they have to be changed every week

619
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,058
so when you come into work on Monday

620
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,740
morning whoever's doing your scouting or

621
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:03,899
management the first thing is to go to

622
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,599
the sticky cards they should always be

623
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,519
dated and then they can go by look at

624
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,719
the sticky cards see what they're

625
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,418
finding if they start to see a few

626
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,220
thrips you know all right we need to you

627
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,590
know mount an attack then on thrips

628
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,620
before they get out of control and

629
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:24,329
what's very interesting is thrips damage

630
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:26,579
on ornamentals and vegetables is very

631
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:31,039
different than the damage we see on

632
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:33,539
trips on cannabis it looks different so

633
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,460
looking at some of the damage images

634
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:37,500
online you have to be very careful about

635
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,669
and I think sometimes people are

636
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,349
mistaking spider my damn purse damage

637
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,350
for spider mite damage because they can

638
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:47,639
look kind of similar but that's where

639
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:49,409
banging them and seeing what falls it on

640
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,900
the leaves looking what's on your sticky

641
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,640
cards will give you a clue to what's

642
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,350
really going on out there

643
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,809
but you need to change your sticky cards

644
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:59,579
every week I'll tell you right now and

645
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:01,289
this is not you know I get no money and

646
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:03,808
no kickbacks but companies like

647
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:06,779
beneficial in Sector E they have really

648
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:10,470
good dry sticky cards which are the kind

649
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:12,539
of sticky cards that growers need you

650
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,579
don't need the really wet gloppy ones

651
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,889
because those are for more for trapping

652
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,659
larger beetles and things you're looking

653
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,549
to trap you know fungus gnats and shore

654
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,940
flies and thrips and other small flying

655
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:25,319
insects again bio best

656
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,610
I'm sorry beneficial in sector E has

657
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:30,990
great ones bio best has some great cards

658
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:33,299
they and they come in an array of sizes

659
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,880
they also offer sticky rolls and they

660
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:38,059
can really help guide you on what size

661
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,820
of cards you need for what

662
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:42,529
doing you know nothing against Amazon

663
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:44,569
because let me tell you I'm on Amazon

664
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:46,490
every two to three days buying stuff but

665
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,049
the cards people are buying on Amazon

666
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,730
are not the right cards and they're

667
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,039
paying too much money for them I had a

668
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:55,160
little rant I post on my Instagram

669
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,049
because when I'm at grow facilities I

670
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,420
like to see the price people are paying

671
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,759
for things and again I have a heart

672
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,920
attack seeing what the cannabis guys are

673
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,500
paying in comparison to what the

674
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,170
ornamental guys are paying and yes when

675
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,220
you buy a pack of sticky cards from

676
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,690
beneficial insectary

677
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,400
you know there's 50 cards in there

678
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,529
you're going to use them if you're

679
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,110
changing them every week and also cards

680
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:19,700
don't expire you know that pack can you

681
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:21,949
know last year year or two and they

682
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,860
don't go bad it's not a disposable item

683
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,890
necessarily and it's much better to have

684
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:30,859
them and use them so that should be part

685
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:33,050
of that routine on Monday morning when

686
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:36,679
you get in and then you need to record

687
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:38,869
what you see you've got to keep records

688
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,000
and it seems like it's a pain in the

689
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:43,250
butt let me tell you after you do it

690
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,769
over and over you start to see patterns

691
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,359
and you can forecast things that

692
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:49,519
potentially could happen with your crop

693
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,849
you'll start to see well this time every

694
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,289
year we get an influx of this pests so a

695
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:56,599
month beforehand let's start getting

696
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:58,940
ready for this pest problem there

697
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:01,069
there's a reason why we focus so hard in

698
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,350
this and agriculture because the end of

699
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:05,659
the day it helps save money and we can

700
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:08,839
head off a lot of pest issues before

701
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,460
they get started so when you go in

702
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,869
you're going to check your cards you're

703
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,009
going to write down what you see you're

704
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:14,359
gonna have your bank board you're gonna

705
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,450
walk around you're gonna knock on

706
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:20,149
numerous places and you're gonna write

707
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,470
down what you find and it's best to you

708
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,110
know if you can put it like into an

709
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,400
Excel spreadsheet and then it's

710
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:27,859
something that you can share with other

711
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,560
people in the facility so then you can

712
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:32,089
have good communication because somebody

713
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,419
may not know you're having an outbreak

714
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:37,789
of thrips in you know house are room B

715
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,710
and go in there and then accidentally go

716
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:42,139
into your propagation area afterwards

717
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,220
and spread the problem so it's really

718
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,200
important to have really good

719
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,630
communication skills and have that

720
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,880
information of what pests are where to

721
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,230
let everybody know in your facility know

722
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,090
you know

723
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,220
you don't want to hide pest issues with

724
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:57,639
your coworkers you need to let everybody

725
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,589
know so the problem can be stopped

726
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,890
through there and those over all these

727
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:05,240
years of doing it the the the facilities

728
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,710
I've worked with that have really good

729
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,269
pest management communication and

730
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,450
record-keeping we just have the best

731
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:12,889
pest management programs so when you

732
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,900
talk about sticky cards you're using

733
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,120
them for monitoring now I know some

734
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,298
people are using them to trap like adult

735
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:22,879
fungus gnats and things like that or the

736
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:25,009
sticky tape are there sort of different

737
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,120
purposes for different cards or do you

738
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:33,200
not even like to use sticky tape at all

739
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,399
in facilities so that's that's a that's

740
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,460
an excellent question

741
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,570
tad so there's sticky cards that I've

742
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,190
just been talking about are for

743
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:42,379
monitoring that's why you change him

744
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,240
every week because if it cards like 2

745
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,860
weeks old and we find fungus gnats you

746
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,569
may not even have fungus gnats anymore

747
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:49,339
because the adults only live a week and

748
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:54,379
those might have been the adults from

749
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:57,109
you know 1014 days ago so sticky ribbons

750
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,929
and a very large cards those are used

751
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:01,339
for what we call mass trapping and those

752
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:03,320
are not they you know the little four by

753
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:05,269
six cards you don't do math trapping

754
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,789
with the small ones mass trapping is

755
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:09,200
done with large ribbons and larger cards

756
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:11,329
and those we leave up for months and

757
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,230
months because we're not using those to

758
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:18,079
monitor what pests are there or how many

759
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,429
are there we're just you know it's like

760
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,230
a vacuum cleaner they're going to be

761
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:23,809
drawn to it and just stuck to it and

762
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:26,089
it's a way to just attract and kill

763
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:29,149
pests so there's a very distinct

764
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:33,308
difference and again the small cards are

765
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:36,080
monitoring cards and the mass trapping

766
00:30:33,308 --> 00:30:39,918
things are more the ribbons or the much

767
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:42,079
larger cards on for using the sticky

768
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,559
ribbon it all depends on how your

769
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:48,079
facilities set up some people have great

770
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:49,339
ways to put them up other people don't

771
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,019
you don't want to get them too near the

772
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:52,369
crop because if you get your plants

773
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:55,129
stuck in them you'll never get them out

774
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:57,019
if it's somewhere near head height

775
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,760
speaking from personal experience you

776
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:01,519
don't want to you know lean your head

777
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,679
into it because those sticky ribbons are

778
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,849
pretty sticky so you have to assess your

779
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,100
facility and

780
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:10,759
even if you have the right setup to use

781
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:12,769
them so again that's why working with

782
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:14,599
somebody that knows about that stuff can

783
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:16,849
say this is a good location this is not

784
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,529
necessarily good location and after you

785
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:21,829
get your head stuck in sticky ribbons a

786
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:23,779
few times you do learn oh I've done it I

787
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:25,669
don't even have much hair but I've

788
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:27,769
definitely gotten those cards stuck on

789
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,110
my stuck on my head and it's it's gross

790
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:33,379
takes a lot to get rid of it and yeah

791
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:35,539
and that's why there go ahead one of the

792
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,220
things you mentioned was location and so

793
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:39,259
if we're putting up monitoring cards can

794
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,269
you talk a little bit about where we

795
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:45,379
want those cards to be located in the

796
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:47,059
facility or in the canopy even so it can

797
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,940
depend on what pest you're really

798
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:51,559
targeting and depends again on how your

799
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,000
actual facility is set up but generally

800
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,980
I always like to have monitoring cards

801
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,289
near the doors because that's usually

802
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,329
the entry point of pests especially

803
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:02,299
since I'm seeing so many growing

804
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:05,240
facilities without vestibules or proper

805
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:08,750
you know ways to stop pests from the

806
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,579
outside from getting in so by the doors

807
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,500
is always very good if you're more

808
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:15,049
concerned about fungus gnats you

809
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,660
definitely want to keep them lower to

810
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,759
the soil line because fungus gnats tend

811
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,580
to be down there if thrips are an issue

812
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,279
they're better to be just up above the

813
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:30,009
plant canopy that's a good location for

814
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:32,720
them so again this is why you know it's

815
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:34,369
it's very general information I'm giving

816
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,829
you and that's why I having somebody

817
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,659
that worked with the stuff to help set

818
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,549
up where you need to put what you know

819
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,560
can really help and you know there's

820
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:46,789
several people out there that that can

821
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:49,069
do it but I you know you know I have

822
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:50,779
issue with you know some people out

823
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:52,429
there promoting themselves as pest

824
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:54,619
management people which just don't have

825
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,120
the experience to do it so just make

826
00:32:54,619 --> 00:33:00,139
sure the person you're dealing with is

827
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:03,079
knowledgeable on the situation and has

828
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,509
had experience with it you know people

829
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:07,759
like Kelly Vance and Paul cool both have

830
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:09,109
been commercial growers for years before

831
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,509
they went to go work for biocontrol

832
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:12,979
companies so they know I mean they put

833
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:14,809
sticky cards out themselves they've

834
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,970
counted them they know how to place them

835
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:18,379
you know so there are people that do

836
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:22,299
have really good experience

837
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:26,740
with this kind of stuff but doorways

838
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:29,269
areas that are more problem prone and

839
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,099
definitely propagation for sure because

840
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:33,379
that's often where you see fungus gnats

841
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:36,049
starting because they tend to be a

842
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,640
little moisture in the soil there and

843
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:40,099
again all the way up to finish crops and

844
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,470
so with with canopy cannabis since it's

845
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:45,250
so tall we are putting some down low on

846
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,930
the soil and some above the canopy and

847
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,549
again depending on how you're set up you

848
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,200
know is there something you can attach

849
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:53,269
to a staked you need to put them on a

850
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,789
pole you know are you hanging them

851
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:56,839
there's all these different variables

852
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,970
depending on how you're actually growing

853
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:02,839
depending on how we position and how we

854
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:04,519
actually put them out well that's good I

855
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,779
think we covered that pretty well I kind

856
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,849
of wanted to ask you a little bit more

857
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:09,168
about what you've been seeing as you've

858
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:11,509
been going out to the facilities like

859
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:13,460
what types of insects in particular

860
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,860
you've been dealing with over the past

861
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,320
year okay

862
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,599
well interesting like I said I mentioned

863
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,220
as of late we're seeing a lot of threats

864
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:26,599
and different flowers rip species out

865
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,638
there I know some people have been

866
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,319
really great and collecting thrips from

867
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,179
weeks we're still trying to figure out

868
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,510
you know all the thrip species we're

869
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,760
seeing it's really hard to identify

870
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:41,720
thrips from their immature life stage so

871
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:46,010
really we need the adults which can be

872
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:48,378
also difficult in itself but thrips are

873
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:52,010
definitely something i think that people

874
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:55,219
are so fixated on broad mite right now

875
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:59,120
Andrew David's that the thrips numbers

876
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:00,619
are definitely coming up so that's

877
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,269
something to definitely keep an eye out

878
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:04,639
for but the good thing about thrips is

879
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:06,590
the adults do fly if you do have sticky

880
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,569
cards out and you don't need to buy the

881
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,960
expensive blue ones for thrips yellow

882
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:14,480
works just fine on the sticky cards for

883
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,010
trapping thrips and they're very tiny

884
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,969
though so you have to make sure you know

885
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:24,770
what thrips on sticky cards look like

886
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:27,109
but you can detect them very easily on

887
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:29,389
the sticky cards just before they start

888
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:32,030
becoming a real issue and you know we've

889
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:33,529
been discussing so you have a little

890
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,960
feeding damage here a little feeding

891
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,510
damage there you know it's not really

892
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,670
going to impact your harvest probably

893
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,620
not you do need to come in you know with

894
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,260
the big guns and nuclear facility

895
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:47,949
probably not you just don't want the

896
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,360
thrips numbers to get out of control

897
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:53,029
because threats are you know pretty

898
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,650
prevalent in the environment and plants

899
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,650
can you know again live with some

900
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,210
feeding damage but you just don't want

901
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,700
them to get out of control but also

902
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,789
thrips are known in especially the

903
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:07,579
vegetable industry for vectoring virus

904
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:09,739
we honestly don't know yet in cannabis

905
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:12,319
you know all the viruses that are out

906
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:14,209
there for cannabis and if thrips are

907
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,820
vectoring them or not we just don't know

908
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:20,929
yet so it's best just to try to keep

909
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,840
them in check I think that that's a wise

910
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:26,059
thing to do and to do that you got to

911
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,700
detect them early and take them out

912
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:31,579
early and then probably the next thing

913
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:34,909
I've been getting a lot of emails on our

914
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:38,509
route acids which you guys are spreading

915
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:41,149
the root aphid amongst yourselves I

916
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,070
think that when people are getting

917
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,750
cuttings in and we you know I think we

918
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,130
discussed this thoroughly on your other

919
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,650
podcast we're talking about dipping

920
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,019
because with the rue de food since they

921
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,280
do live on the roots people think if

922
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,750
they getting cuttings they're not going

923
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,780
to get rude aphid but what I'm seeing

924
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,280
happening is when those rue de foods get

925
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,680
to a high population they start climbing

926
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,840
up the plant and then the a late or the

927
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:05,119
winged form is on the foliage and if you

928
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,300
take a cutting and it goes to somebody

929
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,369
else and that one adult a fit is on

930
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,550
there the female then she can start a

931
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:16,009
whole new colony because you know these

932
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,440
are not coming in fine numbers from the

933
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,020
outside even though the particular 1/3

934
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,809
we're seeing at this point it can be a

935
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:26,000
pest in other crops like rice and some

936
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:29,269
ornamental plants but I'm not seeing

937
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,489
high numbers in in the ornamental crops

938
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:33,949
of this I have seen it but it's not a

939
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:36,039
huge problem so it's just getting spread

940
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:38,750
around through the industry on its own

941
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:41,449
so that's why again sanitation and

942
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:44,068
proper protocol on dealing with incoming

943
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:47,879
plants is really critical because

944
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:50,068
the that the Rudy food hemp for us it

945
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,699
might again you're bringing it in on

946
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:55,170
plant material completely can press it

947
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:56,639
mites are still a big issue

948
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,309
definitely self seen them around but I

949
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,199
think everybody is getting settled into

950
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:03,390
programs at least people I'm working

951
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,190
with but we can get them down to you

952
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:07,429
know such a low level that yeah there's

953
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,838
a few here and there but we're not

954
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:11,429
suffering yield loss at the end because

955
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,798
you're not going to be able to eradicate

956
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:16,379
them unless you you know completely shut

957
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:17,969
down scrub everything down and then find

958
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,390
clean plant material which is a

959
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:23,219
challenge because I've seen plants that

960
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:25,858
are you know young plants being sold and

961
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:31,528
they have him for us at might and so

962
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:34,828
it's it's very challenging to keep it

963
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:38,039
from coming in and growers have to

964
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:39,690
understand that eradication is is not

965
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,999
gonna happen that that's not even a term

966
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,849
we use anymore in pest management it's

967
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:47,218
keeping it below the economic threshold

968
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:49,229
keeping the pests number so low that we

969
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:52,858
don't suffer any economic loss from it

970
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:54,958
so so you mentioned you mentioned thrips

971
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:59,278
you mentioned Rudy fits impressive my

972
00:38:54,958 --> 00:39:03,118
broad mites what insects are we bringing

973
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:04,108
in I guess from the outside what we need

974
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,599
to worry about from the outside

975
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:08,848
environment things like spider mites for

976
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,588
example whereas certain things are like

977
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,390
broad like not broad mites but

978
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:15,298
impressive might see mentioned are only

979
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:18,748
spread on plant material from cuttings

980
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:20,608
yeah so what things are environmental in

981
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:22,858
terms of just our outside atmosphere we

982
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,449
might be bringing it in from our you

983
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:26,969
know from our outside garden or just

984
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:29,099
from walking around versus things that

985
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:33,329
are being spread specifically on

986
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:35,880
cannabis plants so what is just you know

987
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,849
everyday kind of pest definitely to spot

988
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,949
spider mite that's something that I mean

989
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:43,048
I have it in my yard right now which I'm

990
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:45,900
pretty excited about because I need some

991
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:48,599
because I've been on this videography

992
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,509
filming binge lately and so I will say

993
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:54,599
for those of you that are coming I'm

994
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:57,478
teaching a workshop next month in

995
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,870
Charlotte North Carolina for biocontrol

996
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,049
for

997
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:04,230
plant propagators and we're actually

998
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:06,150
gonna go to out to Metrolina greenhouses

999
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,340
it's a hundred and eighty acre

1000
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,700
greenhouse and we're going to show you

1001
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,230
how we do biocontrol releases their show

1002
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:14,669
about nematode applications it's going

1003
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,990
to be a really good hands-on workshop

1004
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,789
but then they're going to be lectures on

1005
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:19,289
the Tuesday and Wednesday you guys are

1006
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:21,750
going to be wowed and dazzled and

1007
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:26,820
thrilled at all this new video footage

1008
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:30,000
I've shot of of I've got footage of you

1009
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,990
know like Swersky feeding on Western

1010
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,730
flower tips

1011
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:34,439
Kika merits feeding on Western flower

1012
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,030
tips I actually got footage and I'd

1013
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,500
never even seen it in my life before and

1014
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,730
I was so excited I ran in and woke

1015
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,369
William up at like 3:00 in the morning

1016
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,559
to tell him and I got the that's nice

1017
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:45,389
dear but I got footage of a Western

1018
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:47,099
flower thrift actually hatching out of a

1019
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:48,210
leaf and most people never see it in

1020
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,329
their life but I'm gonna be able to show

1021
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,780
those videos at this workshop back to my

1022
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,480
point

1023
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,130
I need spider mites to be able to you

1024
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,079
know show the predatory mites feeding on

1025
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:00,360
spider mites and I just went out to my

1026
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,309
yard and on my milk weeds I have to spot

1027
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,849
spider mites just right in my yard right

1028
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:09,179
there so that is something that is

1029
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:11,339
really what we call a cosmopolitan pest

1030
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:14,009
we went down to any retail Garden Center

1031
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,690
we could probably find it it's just

1032
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,650
around so that's something that's very

1033
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:23,010
easily can easily get into your facility

1034
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:26,010
I do think the commercial cannabis

1035
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:29,340
growers they're on top of the spider

1036
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:32,130
mite problems because that is something

1037
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:35,460
they can recognize early on it's bigger

1038
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,410
the damage is pretty obvious and there's

1039
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,329
so many different predatory mite options

1040
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:41,609
depending on how you're growing to use

1041
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:43,710
and the growers I'm working with a lot

1042
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,110
of Marge's doing a preventative program

1043
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,150
because if you look at a preventative

1044
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:49,740
spider mite program and using something

1045
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,059
and again this depends on where you are

1046
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:53,489
in the country and how you grow but like

1047
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:56,190
per symbolist you're talking about every

1048
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:58,679
two weeks it's less than a penny a

1049
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:01,710
square foot for a preventative program

1050
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:06,750
and so the prevention costs are so low

1051
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:08,550
that it's definitely worth doing so but

1052
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,760
that spider mites that's very out there

1053
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:13,980
now broad mite I do believe broad my

1054
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,890
being spread through cannabis cuttings

1055
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,659
but broad might is also a test in

1056
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:21,269
ornamentals and it's a pest in

1057
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:23,849
vegetables so again it's somewhat

1058
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:26,519
cosmopolitan but the broad might I don't

1059
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:28,289
find in the landscape so much but

1060
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:31,230
definitely a commercial growing

1061
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:33,590
facilities for again ornamental hanging

1062
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:36,869
baskets people that produce a pepper

1063
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:39,180
young pepper plants that we can find the

1064
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:41,910
broad mites there and we are definitely

1065
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:44,789
finding them in cannabis so they could

1066
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:46,589
be coming on cuttings or if you go to

1067
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:48,779
somebody's garden sit in the morning or

1068
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,309
out in a pepper field and then go to

1069
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,200
work there's a chance you could spread

1070
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:53,909
them that way and vice versa where you

1071
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,259
could pick broad might up at work off a

1072
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:58,319
cannabis and bring it home to your

1073
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,810
ornamental plants and you know with

1074
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,150
broad might it's so tiny you know it's

1075
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:08,250
it's it's tiny like the hemp for us it

1076
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:10,769
might is you have to you know you

1077
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,210
usually see the damage before you really

1078
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:15,539
realize you have them and then you have

1079
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:17,670
very high numbers luckily a lot of

1080
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:20,400
commercial growers are using Keuka Maris

1081
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:24,019
the predatory mite and Keuka Maris will

1082
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:27,150
feed on flower thrips their first instar

1083
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:30,000
but also feeds on broad night and it

1084
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:34,289
also snacks not controlled but will

1085
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,130
snack on to spot spider mites so using a

1086
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:41,849
cue camaris program like a base four of

1087
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:45,150
that is a really good way to go they're

1088
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:47,219
inexpensive to use beneficial insectary

1089
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,260
is producing them right in California

1090
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:54,419
there's also you know other good

1091
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:56,340
suppliers like bio best bio line so you

1092
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:00,150
know there's there's other options to

1093
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:04,200
get them from to now one of the things

1094
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:06,059
that you mentioned was pepper plants

1095
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,849
having broad mites and that got me

1096
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:12,719
thinking about how a lot of growers that

1097
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:15,839
are doing living mulches did I hear

1098
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:18,719
about and I worry about that as a

1099
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,700
potential vector for some of these pests

1100
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,529
is that really a concern with a lot of

1101
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,960
these cover crops or other crops that

1102
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,680
they may have in the facility are you

1103
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,579
are you have you seen

1104
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,858
any facilities like this well I haven't

1105
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:35,099
seen many cannabis growers that are

1106
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:36,568
doing that because usually the cannabis

1107
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:39,660
growers that I'm working in our bit

1108
00:44:36,568 --> 00:44:43,588
larger facilities and they're doing more

1109
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:47,789
containerized plant material and not so

1110
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:50,880
much the living soil as much because the

1111
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:53,279
scale of the facilities I'm often

1112
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,059
dealing with don't lend itself to that

1113
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,710
kind of growing but that said you know

1114
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:02,069
we've had lots of years of experience

1115
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:05,159
with using you know these nectary plants

1116
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:06,568
in Ag and ornamentals and everything and

1117
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,269
you'd better know what plants you're

1118
00:45:06,568 --> 00:45:12,329
putting in there because I've seen

1119
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:14,730
people make mistakes and turns out that

1120
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:16,289
the plants they're using are harboring a

1121
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,719
lot of the pests and the pests are

1122
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:20,940
reproducing on those plants and so

1123
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,799
that's what you better be very careful

1124
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,200
you know marigolds are one that I just

1125
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:31,440
cringe at people using because those are

1126
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:32,789
very prone to having spider mite issues

1127
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,950
they're very prone to having thrips

1128
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:37,440
issues they're a very buggy plant

1129
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:40,199
because when we grow them for you know

1130
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,909
the the homeowner market they they have

1131
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,480
to get treated a lot because they do

1132
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:47,068
have a lot of insect and might issues so

1133
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,900
that's why we're very selective on the

1134
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:51,449
plants we're using like with our banker

1135
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,088
plant programs and we are sticking with

1136
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:57,409
specific ornamental peppers but we also

1137
00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:59,759
treat those peppers with our beneficials

1138
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:01,409
so that you know when you're applying

1139
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,930
your aureus and q chimera it's not only

1140
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:06,328
does your crop get it the those plants

1141
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:07,679
would get an application to in the

1142
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:10,920
growing situation you're talking about

1143
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,899
is or they should be doing it because

1144
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,849
peppers I think are something and again

1145
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,539
this will be a whole nother podcast will

1146
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:19,980
have to do talking about using peppers

1147
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:21,539
banker plants for cannabis production

1148
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:25,920
because I think there's a lot of

1149
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:28,588
potential there and actually there is a

1150
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,548
greenhouse facility in New York State

1151
00:46:28,588 --> 00:46:34,440
Dickman farms they're getting ready to

1152
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:37,440
go into some serious production of

1153
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,090
ornamental pepper plants grown with

1154
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,389
biocontrol agent

1155
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:44,880
so that when cannabis people want to

1156
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:46,859
move into doing this that they can

1157
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,960
contact Dickman get these plants they

1158
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,450
won't have pesticide residue on them and

1159
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,920
they can't advertise that they've been

1160
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:55,139
raised with beneficials because you

1161
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,210
can't ship insects across state lines

1162
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:59,579
without having permits but know that

1163
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:02,659
these plants have been grown using the

1164
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:05,429
beneficials on them wink wink nod nod

1165
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:08,369
and that so you'll be able to move them

1166
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:11,819
into your facility and then it will

1167
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:14,670
provide a good resource for aureus the

1168
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,650
mine at pirate bug yeah I actually

1169
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,260
ordered some seeds and grew out the

1170
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,000
purple flash pepper in our greenhouse

1171
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,560
this year we didn't bring in any

1172
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,289
beneficial insects just because we

1173
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,429
didn't have much of a budget for it and

1174
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,960
I just was curious if any would

1175
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:30,869
naturalized so I need to actually go

1176
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,789
back and see if we did get anything on

1177
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:34,230
there but all things aside they're just

1178
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:36,809
they're beautiful plants I mean for me

1179
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,909
that aspect of our business is it's

1180
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:41,940
really just a you pick for the community

1181
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:43,799
so it's not a high-value crop for me or

1182
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,400
part of my revenue if it was I would

1183
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,620
definitely put more time and energy into

1184
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,590
maintaining it well and and and there's

1185
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:56,519
a big difference between growing outside

1186
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:59,820
and growing indoors so if you're outside

1187
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:02,909
you don't necessarily necessarily need

1188
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:05,720
to inoculate them if you come again to

1189
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:09,869
this this workshop I'm doing next month

1190
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:12,089
they're at Metrolina one of the mum

1191
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:14,460
fields is 20 acres and I think there's

1192
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:16,410
another one that's like 16 acres we do

1193
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:19,050
put out a lot of these in Sector II

1194
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:21,420
plants but we have pre-inoculated some

1195
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:23,610
of them with beneficials but then the

1196
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,139
other plants do attract in native

1197
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:28,590
beneficials because this is being done

1198
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:31,079
outdoors now the plants that we use

1199
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:32,850
strictly inside you we do have to

1200
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,860
inoculate with the beneficials because

1201
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:38,369
you can't get the numbers of beneficials

1202
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:40,349
coming in from the outside and you know

1203
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:43,440
there was a really good learning moment

1204
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:45,000
like that I was in Colorado working just

1205
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,809
recently I'm actually got back yesterday

1206
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,250
and I went to lunch with the growers and

1207
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:52,150
as we were walking back to the car they

1208
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,920
had some planners in the city

1209
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,450
they were filled with a lissom and then

1210
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,250
they also had petunias and some other

1211
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:59,500
plants in there and I had him stop and

1212
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:03,548
look and if you looked at the alyssum

1213
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,019
the ilysm was just just tons of insects

1214
00:49:03,548 --> 00:49:06,278
were on it buzzing around there were

1215
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:07,838
been officials there are pollinators

1216
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:09,699
there all kinds of stuff there was

1217
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,369
nothing on the petunias and the other

1218
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:14,618
plants and it just shows you that if you

1219
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,160
plant the right plants and this is for

1220
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:18,548
outdoors

1221
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:20,108
you can't attract beneficials in it but

1222
00:49:18,548 --> 00:49:22,210
again you don't want to plant things

1223
00:49:20,108 --> 00:49:23,949
that are going to be a big magnet for

1224
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,599
pests though so you do have to be

1225
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:26,798
careful in your plant selection you have

1226
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,990
to look at you know what your

1227
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:30,940
environment is what your key pests are

1228
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:32,949
and that's how we put all these programs

1229
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,170
together you're not going to find one

1230
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:38,288
solution that works for everybody and

1231
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:42,548
you know pest management really today

1232
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:44,140
has to be pretty customized for

1233
00:49:42,548 --> 00:49:46,210
depending on how you're growing what

1234
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:47,828
you're growing who you're growing for

1235
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,318
you know all these different variables

1236
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:52,028
also what's your budget how much time do

1237
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,798
you have because a lot of my growers

1238
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:55,630
they don't have time to do banker plant

1239
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:56,920
systems or nectary plants or mess with

1240
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,660
that so they'll just rather buy

1241
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,329
beneficials every two weeks and dump

1242
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:03,368
them out other people have the time and

1243
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:05,200
on a tighter budget and they'd rather

1244
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:07,240
try to you know encourage some of their

1245
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,769
native their own beneficials but you

1246
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:10,000
really have to know what you're doing

1247
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:12,818
because you have to make sure you're not

1248
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,269
breeding pests yeah one thing you

1249
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:19,298
mentioned there earlier on was about

1250
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:20,949
applications and propagation and I know

1251
00:50:19,298 --> 00:50:22,630
I've heard you mentioned to me before

1252
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:25,469
that one of your issues with some of the

1253
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:27,970
other recommendations you're seeing from

1254
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:29,409
people that are going around is bug

1255
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:32,230
consultants is that they're they're

1256
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:33,788
doing too heavy of applications too late

1257
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,190
in the plant's life and it's really

1258
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:38,829
important to get started right away with

1259
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:40,690
that cutting to really establish those

1260
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:43,539
beneficial insects and keep the the

1261
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:46,510
pathogen or pest populations down early

1262
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:48,549
on is that pretty accurate oh my god I

1263
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,920
want to stick a gold star on your shirt

1264
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:54,278
right now for like at least I wouldn't

1265
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,809
talk I mean it seems like I mean I mean

1266
00:50:54,278 --> 00:50:59,318
I don't know everything and I'm still

1267
00:50:55,809 --> 00:51:01,150
learning every day too but that is one

1268
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:04,480
of the most important things you've got

1269
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:06,160
to start clean I don't understand this

1270
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,809
we'll deal with it later mentality

1271
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,549
because all that's going to happen is

1272
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:12,279
your numbers are gonna get worse and the

1273
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:14,260
cost of doing a bio program and

1274
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,890
propagation when the plants are tiny and

1275
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,970
close together it's so inexpensive

1276
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:21,639
comparatively to try to come in and

1277
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:23,078
flower and clean up an epidemic problem

1278
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:25,539
and that's something we're really going

1279
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,070
to focus on at this workshop which by

1280
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:30,849
the way it's called the plug and cutting

1281
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:33,640
conference it's a very quaint meeting

1282
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:35,650
it's not super big but it it is and it's

1283
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:37,210
not just for pest management it's it's

1284
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:39,220
the whole meeting talked about a lot of

1285
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:43,240
propagation stuff and there's a mini

1286
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:46,179
trade show with it but my focus there is

1287
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:48,269
to yes beat you propagators up or people

1288
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:51,789
that are propagating young plants on

1289
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:54,389
more so how to use BIOS and propagation

1290
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:56,800
and again Metrolina

1291
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:59,650
you know if you've got a greenhouse

1292
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,300
facility that's 180 acres and they're

1293
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,880
using bio control in their propagation

1294
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,570
if you can do it on that scale anybody

1295
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,088
can do it

1296
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:09,400
and I'm actually going to have the

1297
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:10,630
employees that actually when they come

1298
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,829
to work they actually put out the bugs

1299
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,588
I'm actually gonna have them they're

1300
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:15,940
doing it so you see how they actually do

1301
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:18,608
it but then we're also going to talk

1302
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:21,068
about you know other different situation

1303
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:22,299
you know storage and then there's going

1304
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:23,619
to be a tour we're going to go out and

1305
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,410
see the mum fields where we're doing the

1306
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:29,470
banker plants I think it's going to be a

1307
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:30,670
good educational opportunity for poor

1308
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:34,959
people and they only run this meeting

1309
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:37,930
every few years so and as a side note

1310
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,659
some really good plant pathologists will

1311
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:42,699
be there like dr. chris hayes who he's a

1312
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:44,799
good close personal friend but he is an

1313
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:47,799
awesome plant pathologist in a view and

1314
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,380
at AAG disease for Biological disease

1315
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,089
management that's a guy that sounds

1316
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:55,059
great I will put up a link on the

1317
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:56,980
podcast page to the conference so people

1318
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:59,858
can sign up and check it out if they're

1319
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,568
interested yeah and also well since I I

1320
00:52:59,858 --> 00:53:03,068
mean I generally don't like to do self

1321
00:53:01,568 --> 00:53:05,219
plugs but it seems like this show I'm

1322
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:07,568
doing them I'm also doing another one

1323
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:09,969
who I'm gonna have to look at the date

1324
00:53:07,568 --> 00:53:11,469
but it's the biocontrol East conference

1325
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:14,379
and that's going to be up in Rochester

1326
00:53:11,469 --> 00:53:18,399
New York and on the Friday of the show

1327
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:21,910
I'm doing a four hour

1328
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,548
insect ID class which if you missed did

1329
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:26,288
it cultivate which by the way I had a

1330
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:28,059
lot of cannabis growers come and I was

1331
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:29,829
so excited to see them that are really

1332
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:31,569
getting into the insect ID we're

1333
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:34,119
basically going to be doing the very

1334
00:53:31,568 --> 00:53:36,608
similar thing at the biocontrol East

1335
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:38,588
meeting up in New York where you're

1336
00:53:36,608 --> 00:53:41,409
going to get four hours of pretty

1337
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:43,480
intensive insect and mite ID which

1338
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:44,798
applies to ornamentals vegetables in

1339
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,019
cannabis because as we've discussed

1340
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:49,088
there's a lot of crossover pests and I

1341
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,710
do have some of the cannabis specific

1342
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:52,869
pests included but we're also putting

1343
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:56,199
together like a booklet to take home

1344
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:58,420
with you from that meeting from that

1345
00:53:56,199 --> 00:54:02,679
class that will basically be a pretty

1346
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,269
good insect ID booklet for you oh that's

1347
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:06,639
great I went to the bio controls West

1348
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:09,338
one as you're as you may recall and I

1349
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:11,139
really enjoyed getting to hear some of

1350
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:14,078
the speakers and also the the course you

1351
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:15,639
taught relating to insects and cannabis

1352
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,260
so it's it's definitely a great

1353
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:19,358
opportunity if you're close by I can

1354
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,490
check it out yes

1355
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,920
so and by the way back the backtrack a

1356
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:26,019
little bit you're talking about pest

1357
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,670
don't forget about your foliar aphids

1358
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:32,559
because those species and we are seeing

1359
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:34,630
several different foliar aphid species

1360
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,400
out there that's something that you

1361
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:38,920
don't necessarily always pick up on

1362
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,470
sticky cards because again sticky cards

1363
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,599
are more for flying insects and if

1364
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:45,509
you've got flying Foley or aphids and

1365
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:49,210
you've got a really high population

1366
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:52,000
somewhere in your facility or you're

1367
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:54,250
open to the outside and flying aphids

1368
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,829
from the outdoors have come into your

1369
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:59,349
facility we see that sometimes and those

1370
00:54:56,829 --> 00:55:02,140
wing to evens may not even be a species

1371
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:03,670
that can survive on your crop but you've

1372
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:05,379
got them trapped on the cards and so

1373
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:07,210
that way you can you know look to see if

1374
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:12,670
this is an issue or not but we are

1375
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:14,079
definitely seeing foliated problems you

1376
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,579
gotta have a pretty high number of them

1377
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,839
before they really cause an issue but

1378
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:20,289
you don't want them to get out of

1379
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:21,699
control luckily there's you know we have

1380
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:24,369
several of our commercial parasites

1381
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:26,139
there's you know predators like lace

1382
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:27,880
wings which you've seen doing a really

1383
00:55:26,139 --> 00:55:31,088
good job and those are inexpensive to

1384
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,059
use and you know even just hosing them

1385
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:34,308
down with

1386
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:36,979
you can knock a lot of them off your

1387
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:39,109
pants so just yeah we are seeing fully

1388
00:55:36,978 --> 00:55:42,198
races and several different species so

1389
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:44,538
keep an eye out for those yeah I just

1390
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:46,548
want to remind listeners that it's so

1391
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:47,660
important to start with identification

1392
00:55:46,548 --> 00:55:50,659
and that's something that you've taught

1393
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:51,949
me because I I still talk to growers and

1394
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:53,929
they're there talking to me about all

1395
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:55,789
these different pesticide applications

1396
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:59,298
that they they start immediately the

1397
00:55:55,789 --> 00:56:01,130
moment they notice an insect pests and a

1398
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:02,509
lot of times I try and get them to

1399
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,189
backtrack and make sure that they

1400
00:56:02,509 --> 00:56:06,889
actually have a positive identification

1401
00:56:04,188 --> 00:56:09,048
because the treatment for broad mites

1402
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:11,778
versus a phase versus thrips can vary

1403
00:56:09,048 --> 00:56:14,088
quite a bit and if we're gonna throw

1404
00:56:11,778 --> 00:56:15,170
money at a problem or potentially stress

1405
00:56:14,088 --> 00:56:16,849
the plant through a pesticide

1406
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,349
application we want to make sure that

1407
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:20,269
we're doing the right one to deal with a

1408
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:22,670
problem so that is something else when

1409
00:56:20,268 --> 00:56:26,058
it actually you you just got a second

1410
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:27,949
gold star tag I'm learning you know this

1411
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:29,569
this is important this is the time of

1412
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:31,608
year here in Washington where we start

1413
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:33,739
seeing aphids on our vegetables so I

1414
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:35,630
just went out and pulled some kale that

1415
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:38,028
I fed to my chickens because it had a

1416
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,130
fence on it that was my way of combating

1417
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:41,539
it but this is the time of year when you

1418
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,619
start seeing powdery mildew when we

1419
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:44,900
start seeing athens

1420
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:46,789
and certain sort of insects like you

1421
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,189
mentioned that tend to be more seasonal

1422
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:51,109
with certain crops and since i'm not

1423
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:53,178
growing cannabis i noticed it on my

1424
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:54,858
vegetable crops but i do know that the

1425
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:56,900
same thing is happening in cannabis

1426
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:58,489
towards the end of the season the plants

1427
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,400
starting to senesce it's finishing up

1428
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:02,798
its flowering and you're going to see

1429
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,019
higher levels of some of these insects

1430
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:08,688
yes yeah / sure but and this is where

1431
00:57:06,018 --> 00:57:10,608
you know like with your kale most likely

1432
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:12,469
you had on there what's sometimes

1433
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:15,038
referred to as the crucifer aphid they

1434
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:17,298
tend to be a little gray inner fuzzier

1435
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:20,239
almost like they've got a dusting on

1436
00:57:17,298 --> 00:57:21,619
them and that yeah see that I'm in my

1437
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:23,749
life and I highly doubt it would ever

1438
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:25,670
move into cannabis oh if you did have

1439
00:57:23,748 --> 00:57:28,218
your kale next to your cannabis green

1440
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:30,619
house yeah I wouldn't worry about it but

1441
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:33,588
if you were growing you know let's say

1442
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:35,179
mums and you saw a green peach aphid on

1443
00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:37,849
that I would be concerned because we

1444
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:41,689
know that can move into cannabis so he

1445
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:44,440
had got to know what you have and God

1446
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:46,659
please stop you know

1447
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,838
pending on the internet God's to

1448
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:53,500
identify your problems because I just

1449
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:55,000
see such bad ID because there's so many

1450
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,920
armchair quarterbacks in the cannabis

1451
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,929
industry that sit behind the computers

1452
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,970
and say it's this this this and it's not

1453
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:02,199
the problem and I'm done getting into

1454
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:04,179
fight to these people on the internet

1455
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:06,039
I'm just done you know going to these

1456
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:09,219
groups because I just get attacked

1457
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:11,920
oftentimes and and I'm done with it

1458
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:13,389
trying to help that way but again many

1459
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:17,409
of you know you've reached out to me

1460
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:19,328
through like Instagram or texted me or

1461
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:21,730
you know numerous other outlets I try to

1462
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,950
help everybody I can but then only have

1463
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:26,889
so many hours in the day and I'm working

1464
00:58:23,949 --> 00:58:28,929
seven days a week right now so um be

1465
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:31,750
patient with me if I don't get back to

1466
00:58:28,929 --> 00:58:33,549
you immediately oh great well I

1467
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,199
appreciate you covering more of the the

1468
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,880
issues around scouting and some of the

1469
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,230
insects that you're seeing now that

1470
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,599
you've been working in cannabis for

1471
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:43,740
another year is there anything else you

1472
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:50,289
wanted to chat about before we sign off

1473
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:52,439
just there are some scouting apps there

1474
00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:56,199
is actually one that's getting better

1475
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:59,380
and it's it's from Cornell and it's the

1476
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:01,210
the green house Scout app now they've

1477
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,130
had some issues now because of all the

1478
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:05,608
new cookies and security issues so I

1479
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:08,559
don't think it's available right now but

1480
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:11,500
and again it's not focused for cannabis

1481
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:14,409
but it's a good general overall with

1482
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,869
some of the basic pests the beneficials

1483
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:19,358
actually some pesticide compatibility

1484
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:21,990
information in there and it's one of

1485
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:25,059
these ever-evolving

1486
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:27,519
apps that Cornell keeps adding to and

1487
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:28,960
being that it's from a university you

1488
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:30,940
know they're very focused on being

1489
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,338
scientifically accurate and everything

1490
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:36,608
but you can go in and you know if you

1491
00:59:33,338 --> 00:59:38,619
look up you know a pest then it can give

1492
00:59:36,608 --> 00:59:42,659
you some of the key beneficial that are

1493
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:46,030
being used for it they also have some

1494
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:48,068
where you can do tracking of populations

1495
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:50,319
in it and you can actually print reports

1496
00:59:48,068 --> 00:59:53,289
from it and you know for ten bucks you

1497
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:55,679
can is a lot of good information from

1498
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:57,869
that and again it's it's ever-improving

1499
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,929
out there

1500
00:59:57,869 --> 01:00:02,880
and that project again is it's a Cornell

1501
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:06,929
University project but dr. Elizabeth

1502
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:10,289
lamb is who's been working on that and

1503
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:11,849
again when I talked to her like two or

1504
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:13,610
three weeks ago the again they're still

1505
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:16,739
trying to get worked out with Google

1506
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:18,360
about getting it back for sale because

1507
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:19,559
of the security stuff and it's not there

1508
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,000
was a problem with their app it's if

1509
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:22,469
you've noticed every website and every

1510
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,329
everything you've got to agree to this

1511
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:25,919
these new messages about cookies and

1512
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,989
stuff they just are working on getting

1513
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,500
that worked out there so you know that

1514
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:33,239
can be another important tool and if I

1515
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,800
come visit your green house and you

1516
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:35,909
don't have sticky cards I'm going to

1517
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,090
poke you in the eye

1518
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:40,859
I just you've got to have those sticky

1519
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:44,370
cards up because they can be such a

1520
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:46,019
great resource great well I'll

1521
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:47,779
definitely put a link to that app as

1522
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:49,650
well for people so they can at least

1523
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:51,960
monitor it and see when it becomes

1524
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:53,610
available again and I just want to thank

1525
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,470
you for your time again today and

1526
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:56,940
sharing with our audience I always learn

1527
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:59,459
something new every time I talk to you

1528
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:01,769
so I really appreciate it well I

1529
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,470
appreciate you giving me the opportunity

1530
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:07,050
to get this information out because

1531
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:09,929
again I'm I'm working in multiple

1532
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:11,670
industries you know the workloads been

1533
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:13,589
pretty intense and I'm trying to help

1534
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:15,599
everybody I can and I think sometimes if

1535
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:18,600
I can educate the masses a little bit

1536
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:21,029
more then it might cut down on some of

1537
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,889
the other you know after-hours

1538
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:26,340
communications which again I don't mind

1539
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:27,719
helping people but it's just you know it

1540
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,010
gets a little overwhelming at time

1541
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:32,269
because I do want to be able to help

1542
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:36,690
