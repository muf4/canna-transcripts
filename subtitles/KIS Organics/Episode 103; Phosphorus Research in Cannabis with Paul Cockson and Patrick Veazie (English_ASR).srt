61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,699
I was super excited to talk to them

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,239
about their latest published research on

63
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,098
cannabis and hemp now on to the show

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,140
hi Paul hi Patrick thanks for coming on

65
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:34,318
the show today

66
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,119
hey great to be here thanks so much Todd

67
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,799
thanks for having us

68
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,120
all right well let's uh let's go ahead

69
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,980
and start with Paul I know you've been

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,180
on the podcast before but can you tell

71
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,639
listeners just a little bit about

72
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,540
yourself

73
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,939
yeah sure

74
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,219
um my name is Paul coxon

75
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,098
um currently I am at the University of

76
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:56,098
Kentucky working on my PhD I'm working

77
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:59,039
with the hemp Agronomy team here under

78
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,598
the direction of Dr Bob Pierce

79
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,659
um and a lot of the work we're going to

80
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,859
talk about today was actually done at NC

81
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,378
State

82
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,420
um and Patrick was heavily involved if

83
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:12,658
not one of the driving forces behind

84
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:14,939
pretty much all this work and this was

85
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:18,179
completed like I said at NC State under

86
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:21,419
the direction of Dr O'Brien whipker who

87
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,760
does Plant Nutrition work there

88
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,699
that's awesome and and Patrick can you

89
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,519
tell us a little about yourself as well

90
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,799
yeah I am Patrick Beezy I'm a master's

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,080
student at NC State under the advice of

92
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,659
Dr Brian whitker and I currently focus

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,700
on substrates and prolite replacements

94
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:41,340
for cannabis and other floriculture

95
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,259
crops most of this work was completed

96
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,259
while I was an undergrad but we're still

97
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:49,259
working with cannabis heavily at NC

98
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,539
State under Dr Brian woodgar's program

99
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,798
it sounds like a great program I I love

100
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,318
the research that you guys have already

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,140
put out for those that aren't aware

102
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,658
Paul's already been on the podcast he

103
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,399
put out an excellent paper that we've

104
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,019
talked about on the podcast called the

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
characterization of nutrient disorders

106
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,039
the Cannabis sativa so I highly suggest

107
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,579
checking that out

108
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,679
um

109
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,819
but Paul can you tell us a little bit

110
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,360
about

111
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,039
um

112
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
the phosphorus paper that we're going to

113
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,000
discuss and why that was an area of

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,280
inquiry that you decide to pursue with

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,019
your research

116
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,258
yeah for sure

117
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,120
um so to kind of begin with um you kind

118
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,620
of have to go back a little bit

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
um we've been working

120
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,399
um in hemp

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,120
um under with Brian whipper for quite

122
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,279
some time and uh when we first started

123
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,280
um the we really didn't have a lot of

124
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,138
scientific foundations for nutrition

125
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,239
work so there weren't really Leaf tissue

126
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,478
standards there weren't really uh

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,000
externally verified replicated

128
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,039
um fertility work that had been done

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,379
um and so kind of our our journey

130
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,259
through hemp we we actually first paper

131
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,300
that we put out was a General survey so

132
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,759
we went to a larger operation and we

133
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,879
surveyed quite a few cultivars we took

134
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,639
Leaf tissue did a survey got some you

135
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,918
know General upper and lower ranges and

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,840
we published that and from that we kind

137
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,240
of had a good idea of what you know an

138
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,918
adequate fertility regime might be and

139
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,079
so we kind of springboarded from that

140
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,698
into the nutrient deficiency work so

141
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,758
trying to really categorize the those

142
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,280
visual symptoms and marry them with the

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,780
critical Leaf tissue values and one

144
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,779
interesting thing we saw out of that

145
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:34,859
study was the phosphorus deficiency it

146
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:36,478
came screaming in very early and uh you

147
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,939
know the tissue values were extremely

148
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,800
low and we started looking at some of

149
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,079
the the popular press stuff out of there

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,819
and recommendations and we were kind of

151
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,478
shocked at how high some of the early

152
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:51,240
phosphorus recommendations in hemp and

153
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,000
cannabis were and so we decided to do

154
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,519
kind of a rate study which was the the

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,860
first paper that we'll talk about here

156
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,159
so we had a phosphorus fertility rates

157
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,919
ranging from

158
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:08,460
3.75 to 30 parts per million and then

159
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,258
kind of explored that and then once we

160
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,060
kind of finished that up Patrick got

161
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,800
really excited about the upper ranges

162
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,899
and wanted to see you know what would

163
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,538
happen at those higher concentrations so

164
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,819
then his work kind of married into that

165
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,860
line of inquiry and then he tested the

166
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,439
upper ranges so that's kind of the

167
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,660
background of this paper and uh how it

168
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,240
all got started

169
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,100
awesome so the the title of the paper

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,560
we're going to discuss first is called

171
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,439
impact of phosphorus on Cannabis sativa

172
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,100
reproduction cannabinoids and terpenes

173
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:45,538
Paul is the lead author on that and it

174
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,819
was published in September of November

175
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,918
of 2020. apologies

176
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,379
um before we get into that though can

177
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,560
you talk a little bit about

178
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:58,259
phosphorus in relation to

179
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,360
plant growth plant health and maybe even

180
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,639
more specifically with with cannabis in

181
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,639
what you found from your original your

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,840
original work

183
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,120
yeah for sure

184
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,939
um you know like I said phosphorus was a

185
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,019
an easy low-hanging fruit early on just

186
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,060
because

187
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,339
um the the massive amounts that were

188
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,000
being recommended to some Growers

189
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,598
um

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,720
and so um physiologically speaking

191
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,659
um phosphorus is uh really important in

192
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,319
Floral development a lot of crops it's

193
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:35,520
an immobile element and so essentially

194
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,300
um what that means is that it will

195
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,659
um

196
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,280
or I'm sorry it's a a mobile element

197
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,840
um and a Spoke there

198
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,619
um and it will

199
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:49,439
um come in pretty early on

200
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,680
um and the plants will be pretty stunted

201
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,740
um you'll have this olive green spotting

202
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,660
um on the lower and older leaves and

203
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,300
then you know that will progress up the

204
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,039
plant and eventually you'll get some

205
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,400
defoliation and like I said an overall

206
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,379
stunting of biomass so with its impacts

207
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,138
on you know floral development and then

208
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,899
also that kind of stunting was kind of

209
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,180
our early interest in it and that kind

210
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,859
of segued into some of the rates that we

211
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,400
chose

212
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,639
um

213
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:23,579
so I wanted to ask you so you saw in

214
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,360
popular literature around cannabis a lot

215
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:29,878
of very high application rates so was

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,820
your initial hypothesis that maybe we

217
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,500
were in general over applying phosphorus

218
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,260
as an industry

219
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,538
was that sort of where you started

220
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,819
yeah most definitely

221
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:44,218
um if you look across the board at you

222
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,200
know say a floor culture

223
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,700
um in general and everything

224
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,040
um you're you're very rarely going to

225
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,720
see phosphorus concentrations as high as

226
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,399
we're being recommended

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,379
um and and furthermore if you you know

228
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,179
over apply phosphorus

229
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,338
um you can get some some pretty

230
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,859
pronounced

231
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:03,180
antagonisms and uh um lock out some

232
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,399
nutrients

233
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,139
um so I I was a little surprised that

234
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,059
some people hadn't experienced more

235
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,360
issues with the extremely high

236
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:14,819
concentrations that we were seeing

237
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,240
well I'd add too that we're also dealing

238
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,580
with phosphorus shortages and over

239
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,459
application of phosphorus leads to algal

240
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,019
blooms and other environmental issues so

241
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,939
there's definitely some sustainability

242
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,519
challenges around

243
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,720
you know the overapplication of P so I

244
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,240
think it's great if we can figure out

245
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,360
what's you know what's optimal for

246
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,560
for this plant

247
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,700
take me through your I guess take me

248
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,979
through this paper take me through your

249
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,019
research then and what you guys found

250
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,580
sure I'd love to

251
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,919
um so the first thing I would like to do

252
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,899
is just acknowledge all the people that

253
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,120
actually worked on this project you

254
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,980
mentioned earlier that Dr whipper's

255
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,500
program produces a lot of great research

256
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,240
and honestly that's really because of uh

257
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,639
who he is as a person how he runs his

258
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,159
team and then kind of the the team

259
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,899
mentality and and uh group support that

260
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,778
we have so I'd like to definitely

261
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,000
recommend that uh you know you all take

262
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:12,000
into account that this was not just you

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,278
know a one-person show it was truly a

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,220
lab effort and everything

265
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:20,039
um but like I said we uh we wanted to

266
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,839
kind of uh explore the uh lower end of

267
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,579
phosphorus fertility

268
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,779
so typically when you're looking at

269
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,459
nutrients

270
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,259
um you have you know your deficiency

271
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,359
level and then you kind of have this

272
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,399
linear increase for your nutrients and

273
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,959
at some point it's going to Plateau on

274
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,299
the upper end

275
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,159
um for both you know biomass production

276
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,319
but then also

277
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,639
um the accumulation of that nutrient in

278
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,220
the plants and if you get too high

279
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,360
you'll actually see a growth decrease

280
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,639
and and we know that just from

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,820
literature that'll kind of have this you

282
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,458
know plateau and then decreasing type

283
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,860
relationship and so we were more focused

284
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,139
on the beginning portion of that curve

285
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,000
so we chose lower phosphorus

286
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,980
concentrations and our rates were

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,159
informed from our previous work and our

288
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,100
surveys so from our survey we knew that

289
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,838
you know in leaf tissue across you know

290
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,360
a couple cultivars you're going to see

291
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:18,000
you know 0.26 to 0.43 percent phosphorus

292
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,820
in the leaves and that work comes out of

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,059
gen Kowalski which is another paper that

294
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,160
we had published in 20 20 I can provide

295
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,838
that link to you to add if you would

296
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,219
like great

297
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,120
um

298
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,399
so we started at 3.75 parts per million

299
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,379
and we went up to 30 parts per million

300
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,299
phosphorus so our rates were 3.75

301
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:45,958
7.5

302
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:48,240
11.25 15 22.5 and 30 parts per million

303
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,919
phosphorus so those were our six comps

304
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,500
concentrations

305
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,000
and we wanted to take the plants from

306
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,078
the very beginning of their life cycle

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,839
all the way to full bud maturity

308
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,239
um so it's 16 weeks eight weeks

309
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,060
vegetative and then another eight weeks

310
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,620
reproductive and we wanted to just kind

311
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,859
of track how the plants developed over

312
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,799
time and then at the end analyze the

313
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,919
buds and see what impacts the

314
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,019
cannabinoids and terpenes if there were

315
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,719
any that these phosphorus concentrations

316
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,519
had so that's kind of a general overview

317
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,839
of the paper

318
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,299
yes so a couple of quick questions I had

319
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,760
so is this paper is based all of on one

320
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:35,458
specific cultivar is that correct

321
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,620
that is correct Okay so

322
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,479
one question I'm going to have right

323
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,399
away is how much variability do you

324
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,680
think we'll get across

325
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,139
cultivars as we look at different all

326
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,359
the genetic diversity in cannabis has

327
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:52,019
anyone looked at that yet

328
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,300
yeah so um that's a great question it's

329
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,278
something that a lot of people ask

330
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,919
um and uh like I said I mentioned that

331
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:02,100
paper from Jen Kowalski she looked at

332
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:05,759

337
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,699
each and every individual one of those

338
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,160
and looked at the phosphorus

339
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,420
concentrations in the leaf tissue and

340
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,939
oddly enough

341
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,979
um you know we we saw some differences

342
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,360
um some very significant differences but

343
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,039
they all kind of fell within this

344
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,379
General range of 0.26 to 0.43 phosphorus

345
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,659
in the leaves and that's really the

346
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,958
driving force and the reason we chose

347
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:43,159
baox for this study was because that was

348
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:46,319
a a high performer a very consistent

349
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,480
genetic consistent phenotype for us in

350
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,879
our research but yes you are right

351
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,980
different environmental factors abiotic

352
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,919
factors cultural factors and genetic

353
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,959
factors will impact this slightly okay

354
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,958
okay now that's I mean that's great and

355
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,759
I love the methodology of your of your

356
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,018
paper here um

357
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,179
I thought you guys did a really good job

358
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,539
with that uh one one question I have

359
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:12,359
then so these varying uh P

360
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:14,539
concentrations they were supplied so

361
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,778
let's just take the

362
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:21,120
3.75 PPM concentration you applied that

363
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:24,179
every single irrigation all the way

364
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,940
through from vegetative through

365
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,359
flowering is that that is correct at the

366
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,860
same concentration the whole time

367
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,740
constant liquid feed of that fertilizer

368
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,899
concentration throughout so no bumping

369
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,399
up or bumping down or boosting during

370
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,839
flowering

371
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
um and again that comes from some

372
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,160
preliminary work that we did looking at

373
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,278
comparing constant liquid feed versus

374
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:50,519
variable feed that we're still sifting

375
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,240
through the data on okay okay

376
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,959
um

377
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,639
great well what uh I guess take me a

378
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,000
little through some of the things that

379
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,159
you measured in your in your study

380
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
and then we can talk about about some of

381
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,139
your results

382
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,899
yeah so um early on

383
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,299
um in the vegetative stage um four weeks

384
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,159
in we took some height and diameter

385
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,899
measurements so just kind of looking at

386
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,480
a general stature of the plants and how

387
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,639
they may be growing over time and um

388
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,220
irregardless of phosphorus concentration

389
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,379
we actually saw

390
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,560
um the very no statistical differences

391
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,720
between either height or plant diameter

392
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,638
and diameter is just the average of two

393
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,199
widths so

394
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,980
um which was kind of surprising to see

395
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:40,139
given our early nutrient deficiency work

396
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:45,240
um you know I kind of surmise that some

397
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:47,159
of that may have to do with just the

398
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,799
um overall cultural conditions um

399
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,078
growing in them we did have a little bit

400
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,859
of phosphorus in our water from the test

401
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:59,039
values that we ran but four weeks in we

402
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,379
didn't see much of a um a different

403
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,578
so you would you'd expected to see a

404
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,259
little bit more of a pronounced

405
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,259
efficiency at that point in time or

406
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,480
stunting on the lowest

407
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,639
concentration

408
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,139
yeah yeah

409
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,060
interesting

410
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,459
um so four weeks not a big difference

411
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,619
what happened is you move forward or

412
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:22,338
were there any other metrics at Key

413
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,320
metrics that you wanted to touch on

414
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,519
yeah um so early on um like I said we

415
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,160
were just kind of tracking biomass

416
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,419
production plant height plant diameter

417
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,399
um but you know you kind of fast forward

418
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,500
to eight weeks um and that's where you

419
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,839
really started seeing um the statistical

420
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,019
differences and again this is still

421
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,240
um vegetative so we did see

422
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,100
um you know this kind of

423
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,620
um variable response and plant height

424
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,139
and diameter but for the most part

425
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,139
plants that were um you know sitting

426
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,778
right at about 11 and a quarter parts

427
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,180
per million phosphorus above that

428
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:59,879
concentration they were all

429
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:01,379
statistically similar and so

430
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,558
um we were again kind of surprised that

431
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:07,078
that was a lower concentration and we

432
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:10,139
saw the same for a total above ground

433
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:13,438
biomass so half of the plants in the

434
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,179
study we destructively harvested at that

435
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,179
eight week vegetative stage because then

436
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,160
the remainder of the half

437
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:22,640
we took out to the full 16 weeks of

438
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
flowering

439
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,298
okay

440
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,000
um and what uh

441
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:32,400
what did you find then at the full 16

442
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,400
weeks

443
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,320
yeah so um there's there's a nice figure

444
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,360
in the paper that kind of categorizes

445
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,859
the the lack of

446
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,479
um differences that we were seeing at

447
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,000
that 11 and a quarter

448
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,319
um parts per million phosphorus

449
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,538
concentration so I'd encourage you all

450
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,579
to be looking along in the paper while

451
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:53,038
I'm talking here

452
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:55,678
um but essentially

453
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,660
um once we got to the

454
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,038
um actually I'm going to back up a

455
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,620
little bit here and I'm actually going

456
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,599
to talk about the leaf tissue because we

457
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,678
did take Leaf tissue concentrations at

458
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,079
eight weeks

459
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,559
okay

460
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:13,319
um so one interesting thing that we saw

461
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,500
um you know so early on very little

462
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:18,000
difference that we're seeing in those

463
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,919
phosphorus concentrations once you get

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,740
to that eight week Mark you know we're

465
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,900
seeing some differences there but at a

466
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,579
much lower concentration I was

467
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,220
personally expecting something around 30

468
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:32,339
parts per million to be adequate for

469
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,620
um hemp that we trialled but one thing

470
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,178
that was interesting is that when you

471
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,000
actually looked at the leaf tissue so

472
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,660
after eight weeks under the leaf tissue

473
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,200
um

474
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,100
uh most recently matured leaves you saw

475
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,380
that

476
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:50,339
um as we increase the phosphorus

477
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,320
concentration we did not see an upper

478
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:54,538
response or a plateau response like we

479
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,819
saw in the plant biomass so the plant

480
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:58,919
was just sucking up the phosphorus and

481
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,079
allocating it to the leaves and we

482
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,259
didn't see an upper concentration there

483
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,058
even at our highest concentration so

484
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,460
this was a really interesting find

485
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:10,980
because it kind of maybe points to the

486
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,220
fact that cannabis may be really good at

487
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,220
sequestering that phosphorus and

488
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,038
actually storing it and so that may be

489
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,620
um kind of a factor that could help

490
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,538
explain why even at these extremely high

491
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,759
phosphorus concentrations that we were

492
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,960
seeing recommended we weren't

493
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:32,940
necessarily seeing any of these

494
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,460
phosphorus toxicities

495
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,100
interesting so

496
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,900
just I'm looking at the graph here and

497
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,119
we'll have links to these papers so

498
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,460
people can follow along I'm on table two

499
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,859
here and it looks like

500
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,840
you you saw statistically significant

501
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:52,379
increase in height and diameter and

502
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,298
above ground dry weight but not in below

503
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,940
ground dry weight or route to shoot

504
00:19:54,298 --> 00:20:01,519
ratio across all concentrations and then

505
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,340
that significance in height and weight

506
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,798
started at 11.25 PPM

507
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,599
all the way to 30 and was essentially

508
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,879
there wasn't a lot of significance

509
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,500
within that range did I state that

510
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,020
correctly

511
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,259
that is correct yeah so essentially

512
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,298
above 11.25 parts per million you're

513
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,759
going to receive the same height and the

514
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:26,639
same diameter and the same above ground

515
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,579
um dry weight or biomass even if you're

516
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,220
applying more phosphorus

517
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,720
now I had always Associated phosphorus

518
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:38,038
with

519
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,558
um root growth and root health is that

520
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,079
not something that you saw in this study

521
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:46,678
in terms of there being any significance

522
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:49,079
at different concentrations

523
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,080
uh yeah you're correct um it does have a

524
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,119
role a large part in um root development

525
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,918
razor sphere management

526
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,899
um branching Etc

527
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,799
um and it was a little bit surprising to

528
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,200
see

529
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,058
um I I think in this study

530
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,740
um just looking at the root balls so

531
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:06,720
when you when we were terminating we

532
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,700
kind of broke apart a few rupoles I

533
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,880
think it more had to do with the fact

534
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,860
that um the rhizosphere volume was

535
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,600
actually a little more limited and so

536
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:19,918
maybe if those would have been larger

537
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:22,798
pots or even some maybe like quar blocks

538
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,660
we could have maybe seen that those

539
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,058
differences come through

540
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,100
okay so you think that one of the

541
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:30,839
limitations might have been just overall

542
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:33,178
root space

543
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,038
yes correct okay yeah because I'm

544
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,240
looking at your photo of these plants

545
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:37,619
and

546
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,980
um

547
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,538
they're not the most robust plants I've

548
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,579
seen

549
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:45,779
um no ever I don't know a nice way to

550
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,899
put that

551
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:51,000
um they look just visually you know to

552
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,019
me a little maybe a little bit nitrogen

553
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,179
deficient

554
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,679
um what what did you think of your of

555
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,480
the overall plant health

556
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,600
in relation to this experiment I guess

557
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,220
that would be my first question

558
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,500
yeah so

559
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,659
um we saw the same thing

560
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
um you know uh you're very you're very

561
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,120
correct

562
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,619
um you know sometimes we as scientists

563
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,678
were really good at running experiments

564
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:16,319
but sometimes our plants may not be the

565
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,019
uh the most uh beautiful

566
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,579
um when it comes to that aspect but um

567
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,558
when we actually looked at all of our

568
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:26,038
macro and micronutrients we were still

569
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,960
within our survey ranges so while the

570
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:31,140
plants may not look the most overly

571
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,700
robust and green and dark foliage

572
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,380
um the the tissue values are still

573
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,220
within a healthy range okay oh good

574
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,880
um

575
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:45,538
so moving forward from eight weeks I I

576
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,120
would assume you would start to see more

577
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,980
more drastic spread in terms of plant

578
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,099
expression and plant Health

579
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:56,700
um what what happened at that point

580
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:58,139
yeah so um again we uh sampled at about

581
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,759
12 weeks

582
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,120
um looking at plant height and diameter

583
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:06,839
and there we did start seeing more of a

584
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:10,199
trend so we saw the the highest height

585
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:13,199
at a higher concentration so 22 and a

586
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,798
half to 30 parts per million as well as

587
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,019
diameter so once they go into that

588
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:22,079
reproductive phase and start

589
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,179
reallocating nutrients from maybe older

590
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,579
leaves into developing sinks which are

591
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:29,100
going to be your flowers we did start

592
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,960
seeing more differences there which

593
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,000
again was a little surprising you know

594
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,159
given how quickly the nutrient

595
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,679
deficiency came in from the deficiency

596
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,780
study but at 12 weeks we started

597
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,980
releasing that value of those higher

598
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,980
fertility concentrations

599
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,559
you know one thing that's common in the

600
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:51,959
industry is to have these uh you know PK

601
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:56,158
boosters where you're you're applying

602
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,558
high phosphorus high potassium in flour

603
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,020
how does how does that reflective upon

604
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,879
your study in terms of what your

605
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,900
findings were do you do you feel that

606
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,280
that phosphorus is potentially

607
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,559
beneficial or do you think that maybe

608
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,000
the potassium is providing some more of

609
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,980
the benefit that people are seeing from

610
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,579
these applications

611
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,099
um

612
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:20,960
I guess what are your thoughts on that

613
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:23,519
yeah that's uh that's a really

614
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,259
controversial uh question there because

615
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,379
there's a lot of people on both sides

616
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:30,900
that have very strong opinions on that

617
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,960
um so I'm gonna speak more from like a

618
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,600
plant physiology standpoint on that

619
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,640
um typically what you see in most crops

620
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,798
is that um there will be this kind of

621
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,320
lag phase behind

622
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,900
um the induction of the reproductive

623
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:47,700
phase versus the vegetative phase

624
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,559
and most of the time what you're seeing

625
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,080
is that the nutrients that that plant is

626
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,879
taking up in the vegetative stage a good

627
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:57,119
portion of those will get reallocated

628
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,520
into that developing sink but you will

629
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,019
have this slight overlap between where

630
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,259
it's switching from vegetative to

631
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:06,179
reproductive and I think what a lot of

632
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:08,759
people are seeing in the industry could

633
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,980
be that kind of lag and overlap

634
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:14,460
different crops will have a different

635
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,019
kind of lag phase and uh you know I

636
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,460
think that we kind of saw that thumb

637
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,700
here

638
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,200
um I don't know necessarily if it's

639
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,019
going to be the potassium or the

640
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,700
phosphorus that's giving that benefit

641
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:28,019
um but like I said I'm going to answer

642
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,600
that question more from a plant

643
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,579
physiology standpoint and kind of say

644
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,319
that you know it's not just this

645
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,058
complete switch where once they go

646
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,980
reproductive they're not going to take

647
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:40,038
up any more nutrients

648
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,038
um

649
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,740
so as plants which

650
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,960
from

651
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,339
you know a vegetative stage to a

652
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,200
flowering stage as they're you know

653
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,778
completing their life cycle

654
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,240
they are still taking up nutrients and

655
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:59,519
the ratio of those nutrients

656
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,778
I assume changes

657
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,278
um

658
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:04,259
so you're saying that there's a lag

659
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,259
between as they make that switch in

660
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:10,019
terms of what nutrients are most needed

661
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:13,200
is that what you're kind of getting at

662
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:15,418
yeah yeah essentially so um you know

663
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,400
it's when a plant switches from a

664
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,380
vegetative stage to reproductive stage

665
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,700
it's not going to be an automatic on off

666
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,440
switch where they're going to

667
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,500
immediately stop taking up any

668
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,179
phosphorus any potassium any magnesium

669
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,460
um you know they're going to continue

670
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,460
taking up those nutrients as they're

671
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,740
transitioning but eventually

672
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,538
um they'll start slowing down on that

673
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,558
uptake at least

674
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:41,879
um from uh from a common physiology

675
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,500
understanding and you can kind of see

676
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,480
that in other crops as they start

677
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,460
dropping leaves and they start senessing

678
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,860
and ending their life

679
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,720
um you know the plant's just gonna at

680
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:54,719
some point stop taking up those

681
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,700
nutrients as much as it would in say a

682
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,740
vegetative stage and it's going to start

683
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,840
heavily reallocating what it's already

684
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,079
taken up

685
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,119
yeah I mean that is a contentious

686
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:09,778
subject in the industry in terms of what

687
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:12,959
an optimal harvestable plant looks like

688
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:15,359
some people really like that senescence

689
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,419
the the colors and and knowing that

690
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,699
there's not as much chlorophyll in the

691
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:24,240
leaves and other people will say you can

692
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,778
really increase your your weights at

693
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,298
Harvest by pushing the plant harder and

694
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:34,380
maybe having what you know looks like

695
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:35,819
less of a finished plant I guess at

696
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,400
Harvest Time

697
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:41,099
maybe higher levels of nutrients in that

698
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,919
plant tissue are accessible to the plant

699
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,658
in the media prior to harvest so

700
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,299
I I think that's an interesting question

701
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:50,278
I'd love to see more research on that

702
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:52,200
oh we would too

703
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:55,558
um it's definitely needed so looking at

704
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,240
uptake partitioning and reallocation in

705
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:59,220
industrial hemp would definitely be the

706
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,419
next kind of iteration of this level of

707
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,220
inquiry

708
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,740
um so it's been something that I've

709
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,620
wanted to do for a very long time I'm

710
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,319
just given the the

711
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,298
current state of understanding and

712
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,460
knowledge that exists within the

713
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:16,980
Cannabis industry and within the

714
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,538
literature yeah I mean I'm sure for both

715
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,500
of you there's a million experiments

716
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:21,119
that you have in your head that you

717
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,619
would love to you would love to get

718
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,239
around to

719
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,918
um at some point

720
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,538
um well let's let's get back to your

721
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,259
paper sorry I kind of went off topic

722
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,759
there

723
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,339
um

724
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,759
were we were we at 12 weeks right now or

725
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:37,619
were you up to 16 weeks where would you

726
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,079
like to continue on from

727
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,219
yeah we can we can kind of go to the the

728
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,960
bud results

729
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,140
um and kind of the the cannabinoid and

730
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,380
terpene results if you'd like great yeah

731
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,538
yeah so once once we finished uh the

732
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,120
experiment again we took height width

733
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:56,460
biomass and we took fresh bug weight

734
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,439
um one thing I will say about that is um

735
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,778
a lot of the bud material we were

736
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,179
analyzing a composite so we're looking

737
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,980
at the the terminal Bud

738
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,080
um an axillary Chute

739
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,120
um terminal bud and then a Bud from the

740
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:12,480
interior of the plant

741
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:15,119
um so we were kind of limited in taking

742
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,099
um our dry mass and so that's why we

743
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,038
took fresh weight on this but I will say

744
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:22,619
I wouldn't lean too heavily on the the

745
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,419
brush weight just given the natural

746
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,219
variability that's going to exist plant

747
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,880
to plant in that

748
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,700
um

749
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,720
but like I said we did a composite

750
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,319
sample

751
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,140
um

752
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,480
sorry did you have something to add

753
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,580
no I mean since he paused I was just

754
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,159
going to ask if you did any any trimming

755
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:44,579
on these plants or pruning

756
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:46,020
um during the flower cycle or not

757
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:48,599
or if you just kind of let them grow

758
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:51,058
that was just one question I had

759
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,759
yeah so for the for the purpose of this

760
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:56,460
experiment we um did not do any trimming

761
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,319
so just kind of as they were throughout

762
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,600
the growing cycle and the reason we

763
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,240
decided to do that is um we didn't want

764
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,980
to potentially interfere with removing

765
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,659
biomass that could still have some

766
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,298
phosphorus resources that could be

767
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:12,360
allocated for the bud or those

768
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:14,879
developing reproductive leaves

769
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,219
that makes sense

770
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,720
um okay sorry keep going

771
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,798
cool

772
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,720
um so then

773
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,000
um like I said we looked at the the

774
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,558
different cannabinoids um and then some

775
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,179
terpenes

776
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:30,000
um and the results were kind of

777
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:32,278
surprising so you know after that eight

778
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,019
weeks of vegetative growth or sorry

779
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:36,179
reproductive growth

780
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,700
um we really saw again this kind of

781
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,860
plateau at about 15 parts per million

782
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,558
phosphorus so when you look at your

783
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,898
Delta 9 THC

784
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:50,099
um you know and then if you also kind of

785
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:52,199
looked at CBD and CBC those had a

786
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,359
plateau at around that 11 and a quarter

787
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,759
parts per million so 11 and a quarter to

788
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,099
15 parts per million above that

789
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,079
concentration we really didn't see an

790
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:03,959
increase

791
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:07,019
in those cannabinoids so again kind of

792
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,179
mirroring what we saw early on at that

793
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,819
kind of plateau range in the the lower

794
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,679
phosphorus concentrations that we

795
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:16,019
studied

796
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,419
that's that's really interesting

797
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,339
um that's much lower than I would have

798
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,380
expected yeah

799
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,278
yeah no it was very surprising for us

800
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,720
too

801
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,398
um which is part of the reason we were

802
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,339
really um excited to publish this and

803
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,259
tried to get it out um pretty quickly

804
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,980
um but one thing I I will mention on

805
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:33,538
this

806
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,940
um in the paper

807
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:38,099
um these are listed as

808
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,240
um milligrams per gram

809
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:41,339
um so when you're looking at those

810
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,558
tables don't assume that that's a

811
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,278
percentage

812
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:46,379
um

813
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,119
okay that makes sense

814
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,580
yeah

815
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:53,459
um so when we when we looked at the

816
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:55,678
actual like um active pools

817
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,480
um so everyone's pretty familiar

818
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,000
um with kind of the acid tools versus

819
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,919
the the active pools

820
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,778
um they're um in the paper we broke

821
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,538
those up and we analyzed them separately

822
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:09,298
because we wanted to see okay so

823
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:11,819
if you are under a state that is going

824
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:13,379
to regulate off of Delta 9 versus total

825
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:14,879
THC

826
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,440
um and then looking at you know what's

827
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,659
in your acid pool and what's in your

828
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,298
decarboxylated pool

829
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,700
um we we kind of separated those so when

830
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:25,200
you look at the acid pool on the acid

831
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,480
pools which is where most of your

832
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
cannabinoids are come from

833
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,980
um when they get decarboxylated there

834
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,679
um again we saw a very pronounced

835
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:38,179
Plateau at that 11 and a quarter parts

836
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:41,820
per million phosphorus for cbda thca

837
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:44,038
total THC Total CBD and total

838
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,480
cannabinoids when you kind of sum them

839
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,298
all together and then divide by the

840
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,099
total cannabinoids analyzed which was

841
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:51,720
again pretty

842
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:54,959
um surprising a lot of times in science

843
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,940
you don't see something that cut and dry

844
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,500
um but this was this was a pretty strong

845
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,340
trend

846
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,700
so almost like a bell curve like a kind

847
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:07,859
of uh with 3.75 on one side and 30 on

848
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:11,880
the other it kind of Peaks at the 11.25

849
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:13,158
range for almost all your cannabinoids

850
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,220
slightly

851
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:18,419
maybe it's more of a um

852
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,759
roller coaster going up to the top and

853
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:23,220
then just coming down a little bit

854
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,679
yeah yeah more like that so kind of kind

855
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,600
of the first half of like a bell curve

856
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,980
or a horseshoe so you know you're coming

857
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,898
up you're coming up you're coming up and

858
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,419
then you level off kind of at that bend

859
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:36,599
and then you kind of stop

860
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:38,640
now was that sickness statistically

861
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:42,839
significant I couldn't say it between

862
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,759
the 11.25 treatment and the 30 parts per

863
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,259
million treatment and the difference you

864
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,538
saw there because I see that your total

865
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:52,140
cannabinoids for example are higher at

866
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:55,798
11.25 you know your total THC is higher

867
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,720
was that considered significant though

868
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:59,940
it was not statistically significant and

869
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,980
part of the reason there is if you look

870
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,960
at the standard deviations

871
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,880
um we had some quite a bit of

872
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,380
variability a little bit more than I was

873
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,820
hoping for

874
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,858
um again it's important when when

875
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,679
looking at any type of graph or figure

876
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:16,259
to look at how much the data is varying

877
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,019
um and so our standard deviations were a

878
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:22,080
bit higher but you are correct between

879
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:25,199
11.25 and 30 parts per million even

880
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,358
though the means were higher at 11.25

881
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,918
compared to the 30.

882
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,019
um you know they were not they were

883
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,838
statistically similar

884
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,099
okay so if we were just going off this

885
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,799
research

886
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,679
in this table we could confidently say

887
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,599
that 11.25 PPM

888
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,378
is going to produce

889
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:49,019
better cannabinoids than 3.75 but you

890
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:51,960
can't confidently say that 30 PPM is

891
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:53,719
necessarily worse than 11.25 other than

892
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,740
the fact you may be over applying

893
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,559
phosphorus based on

894
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:02,459
these charts

895
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,320
yeah so it's it's kind of hard to make a

896
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,119
sweeping generalizations

897
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,940
um in the sciences and everything I

898
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,039
think everyone's pretty pretty well

899
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,659
aware that based on you know your vapor

900
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,279
pressure deficit what type of Lights

901
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,440
you're running what temperature you're

902
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,540
going for you know are you using kind of

903
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,179
a living bed or are you working in an

904
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:22,980
inner media you know all of all of these

905
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:24,719
recommendations will change and again

906
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,800
when you add into that you know the

907
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,358
slight

908
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,339
um cultivar differences that you're

909
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,679
seeing it makes it really difficult to

910
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:33,599
make an absolute all-encompassing

911
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,699
definitive statement on this is

912
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,440
unequivocally the best phosphorus

913
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,299
concentration

914
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,880
um the thing I always recommend is you

915
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,200
know this is what the data's saying and

916
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,838
at the end of the paper we kind of give

917
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,460
a general range but to always make sure

918
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,139
you're correlating that back to Leaf

919
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,780
tissue values because if you're just

920
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:53,759
focusing on what you're applying once it

921
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,200
goes into your system you know microbes

922
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,820
may use some of it if you're amending

923
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,618
with microbes and you're going organic

924
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,480
and so that may decrease the available

925
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,519
phosphorus to the plant but your Leaf

926
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,320
tissue is always a good go-to because it

927
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,838
tells you how much phosphorus the plant

928
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,880
is actually getting which is again why

929
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:10,679
we started with the survey ranges you

930
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,720
know because if if you're in a highly

931
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,338
organic system and you're amending with

932
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,379
a lot of bone meal

933
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,299
it takes time for that to break down you

934
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,099
know there's a cost as that phosphorus

935
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,140
goes to the microbes and then gets you

936
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:24,539
know mineralized with the plant and so

937
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:27,838
you really want to fine-tune your own

938
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,920
specific operation by checking your Leaf

939
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,059
tissue

940
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:36,300
yeah absolutely I I don't mean to imply

941
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:38,759
to listeners that uh this study is at

942
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,019
all definitive about optimal phosphorus

943
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,800
levels

944
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:42,179
um

945
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,280
and that there's still a lot of research

946
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:46,618
to do but I think that the trend that it

947
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,880
points to is is really interesting and I

948
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:52,680
think it would give people a starting

949
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,300
point for where to consider uh you know

950
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:58,319
starting a trial or experiment in their

951
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,060
own in their own garden or or facility

952
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,099
yeah absolutely

953
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,199
um I definitely agree there's way more

954
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,900
research that needs to be done other

955
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:09,000
scientists other cultivars need to be

956
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,420
studied we can only all get better

957
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,039
together as more and more data comes in

958
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,820
um but you know

959
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,400
um

960
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,619
kind of um going back to the the next

961
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,900
table in the paper where we looked at

962
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,700
the the terpenes

963
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,980
um pretty much across the board

964
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:28,319
um we saw a lot of variability and not a

965
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,960
lot of statistical significance

966
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,880
um and so you know we were we were

967
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,220
somewhat hoping that we could kind of

968
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,400
correlate these uh mineral nutrients

969
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:41,879
going into the system and potentially

970
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,980
see an impact there but really the only

971
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,500
one that we saw on impact in

972
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:50,400
um was I'm going to butcher this I think

973
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,780
it's granol or or Journal I can't

974
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,300
remember off the top of my head how to

975
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,640
pronounce that I do apologize

976
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,800
um and that one

977
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:03,539
um we actually saw lower concentrations

978
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,740
above the 11.25 parts per million for

979
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:06,739
that particular terpene

980
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:14,579
would you have expected phosphorus to

981
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:16,858
play a bigger role in terpene expression

982
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:20,760
based on what you know of the of how the

983
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:24,358
plant utilizes phosphorus as a mineral

984
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,980
so as far as like Upstream effects um in

985
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:27,900
the physiology

986
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,579
um you know your phosphorus your sulfur

987
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,059
your nitrogen are going to play kind of

988
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:35,220
a role in most enzymatic processes

989
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:37,199
um and so we were potentially thinking

990
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:38,159
that there could be some Downstream

991
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,439
effects

992
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,500
um but it was a long shot

993
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,539
um but you know you you miss 100 of the

994
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,820
shots you don't take so we wanted to try

995
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,759
and throw in this data set to see if we

996
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,800
could uh kind of quantify maybe some uh

997
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,480
far Downstream effects

998
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,920
oh no I think it's great that you guys

999
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,300
took that data I think it's really

1000
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,338
interesting that you didn't see a

1001
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,480
difference

1002
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,980
I don't know what I would have

1003
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,079
hypothesized but

1004
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,539
um yeah that's very interesting so I'm

1005
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
glad you guys did that

1006
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,820
um

1007
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,919
can you tell me a little about your

1008
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,019
about the discussion probably your paper

1009
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,900
and sort of what some of your your

1010
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:18,199
conclusions were around around this uh

1011
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:23,639
this trial

1012
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:27,559
yeah so um you know when look at this

1013
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:29,519
um the the story is kind of

1014
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:32,159
complicated

1015
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,679
um you know a lot of times it's it's

1016
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,598
easy to sit down and give kind of a

1017
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,279
straightforward story

1018
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,640
um like you know we want everything to

1019
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,380
be cut and dry but really the the

1020
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:45,719
results of this paper

1021
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,579
um that we go through in the discussion

1022
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,959
um it's kind of like

1023
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,960
um

1024
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,179
we really want Growers to take this data

1025
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,820
and apply it to their own operation so

1026
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:58,559
you know if you're going for clones you

1027
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,539
may have a different phosphorus

1028
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,960
recommendation than if you're trying to

1029
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:06,420
produce biomass for say a distillate

1030
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,300
market versus you know quality bud

1031
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:14,400
that's going to be sold to like you know

1032
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:15,060
a uh just as a Distillery for

1033
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,980
um

1034
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:18,980
you know actually

1035
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,980
um

1036
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:26,519
smoking that that fresh bud so where

1037
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,400
you're aesthetic is a lot more important

1038
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,119
um so uh really

1039
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,180
um

1040
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,519
the best thing that I can I can comment

1041
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:38,879
on for the discussion is

1042
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,079
um you know are Leaf tissue values for a

1043
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,838
phosphorus

1044
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,420
um they were within the previously

1045
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,159
reported values from Bryson and Mills

1046
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,659
which was encouraging

1047
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,920
um and again we compare that to some

1048
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,039
early work that we did with Hunter

1049
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,838
Landis in the survey

1050
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,559
um and then like I said I mentioned the

1051
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:00,960
the newer paper which in walski

1052
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,000
um but you know early on we talk about

1053
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,338
how plant height and width weren't

1054
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,980
necessarily all that statistically

1055
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:09,539
significant but later on

1056
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,858
um you know we we did see those

1057
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,858
increases so

1058
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:19,500
yeah kind of a very very cursory summary

1059
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,339
of the discussion

1060
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:25,019
sure do you feel like

1061
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:28,199
I mean because you applied the same rate

1062
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:30,440
of phosphorus throughout the entire uh

1063
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:33,239
life of the plant

1064
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,880
would you just speculate that there may

1065
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,439
be advantages to applying phosphorus at

1066
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,420
different concentrations at different

1067
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,460
plant stages

1068
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,460
from a from a grower perspective

1069
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:48,179
yeah

1070
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,980
um so you know obviously if you have a

1071
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:51,358
developing seedling

1072
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,780
um you're not going to want to dump on

1073
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,299
you know kind of a nutrient regiment for

1074
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,220
like a a full-grown plant

1075
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,140
um so most of the time

1076
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:04,379
um you know there will be variability

1077
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:06,179
within your nutrient program

1078
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,160
um but as far as correlating that to

1079
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:10,379
specific stages

1080
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,139
um at this point I really do think that

1081
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,880
we we need quite a bit more research

1082
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:15,779
um you know going into that because a

1083
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,640
lot of

1084
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,760
um This research here

1085
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:23,039
um is not necessarily a one-to-one

1086
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,440
comparison

1087
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,900
um or for most Growers because they are

1088
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,559
on that variable regiment

1089
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,180
um uh model and so you know one of the

1090
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,000
things we have to do in science is kind

1091
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:37,879
of go back to

1092
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,260
um kind of the the least common

1093
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,000
denominator there and we have to kind of

1094
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,099
eliminate that variability from the

1095
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,260
phosphorus so we apply that phosphorus

1096
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:49,019
at a constant rate so that we don't get

1097
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,720
any confounding effects from a variable

1098
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:55,079
rate of phosphorification but I would

1099
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:57,118
love to see this work continue and then

1100
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,500
actually testing different regiments and

1101
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,380
different timings

1102
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,079
um so you know that I don't know if that

1103
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,599
directly answers your question

1104
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,900
yeah it's it's challenging

1105
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,359
for me because in the on the industry

1106
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,240
side most Growers don't have access to

1107
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:17,519
Leaf tissue analysis

1108
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:22,639
so we're relying on

1109
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:24,239
visual symptoms and which can be very

1110
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,219
challenging because there can be

1111
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:27,838
confounding variables when as as you

1112
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:30,358
know when it comes to deficiencies or

1113
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,519
toxicities and a lot of those can relate

1114
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,500
to

1115
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:38,460
watering and environment so it can get

1116
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,679
very confusing or were required to use

1117
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,599
soil tests so a lot of what the work

1118
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:43,259
that I'm doing is using

1119
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,000
um

1120
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:50,579
soil testing in soilless organic media

1121
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,920
looking at like a malic-3 and a

1122
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:56,099
saturated paste test and then

1123
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,420
making decisions based on that you know

1124
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,300
if we're talking about specifically with

1125
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,980
phosphorus availability we look at the

1126
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,260
pace test and see how much is in

1127
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,139
solution and then make estimations off

1128
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,700
of that as to how much phosphorus is

1129
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:09,719
going to become available throughout the

1130
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:11,578
growth cycle

1131
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:13,219
and it gets even more complicated

1132
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,839
because we have

1133
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:17,818
microbes processing all of these

1134
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,239
amendments like you mentioned with bone

1135
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:23,300
meal or other P sources

1136
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,919
it becomes very very challenging to know

1137
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,440
exactly how much phosphorus the plant is

1138
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,639
getting at any you know given stage of

1139
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,940
growth or

1140
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:34,739
any particular date and in its growth

1141
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,019
cycle

1142
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:39,179
yeah it does it does make it really

1143
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:41,159
challenging and it's kind of one of

1144
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:43,379
those things that I cringe every single

1145
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:44,818
time I have to say it

1146
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,818
um because I feel like I I just

1147
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:50,818
constantly am advocating for nutrient uh

1148
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:52,858
sorry Leaf tissue analyzes and like you

1149
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:55,440
said it's not either acceptable to the

1150
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:58,380
industry or it's just not common at all

1151
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,059
um and there are a few other works out

1152
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,318
there that I've seen potentially

1153
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:06,299
correlating spectral Imaging to nutrient

1154
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,000
concentration or even looking at say

1155
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,519
like a pour through method or um you

1156
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,139
know some sort of a leashing analysis

1157
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,119
where you know what you're putting into

1158
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:17,879
the system and then you can check what's

1159
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,099
coming out at the other end either at

1160
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:24,358
the you know draining from the pot or

1161
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:26,280
from your you know slab and then trying

1162
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:28,440
to extrapolate back out to that you know

1163
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,000
what may be taken out by the plant but

1164
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,260
again like you mentioned it gets

1165
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,440
complicated because you also have the

1166
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,880
microbes in there potentially algae but

1167
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,980
you know know there's definitely more

1168
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:42,180
research needed to try and potentially

1169
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:44,099
find a quick and dirty method for the

1170
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:47,000
industry you know so that we don't have

1171
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:49,140
to rely on these costly

1172
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,119
resources yeah and like you mentioned

1173
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:52,739
affordable too because it that's a

1174
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,240
that's a big issue for a lot of Growers

1175
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:56,159
right now especially in the current

1176
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,879
state of our

1177
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:02,460
of where our industry is at nationally

1178
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,039
which is I'm really curious to hear as

1179
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,619
we move on to Patrick's work because one

1180
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,719
thing that we found

1181
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:11,160
in in our testing and just you know

1182
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:13,559
correlating the data that we're getting

1183
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:15,899
off of soil tests with plant health and

1184
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,779
and yields in the facilities that we

1185
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,180
work with is that we can apply

1186
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,760
significantly lower levels of phosphorus

1187
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:25,578
and even have lower like one of the best

1188
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,880
performing facilities I work with has

1189
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:31,980
consistently low available phosphorus

1190
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,160
and yet if you if you look at their bud

1191
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,260
and dry weight it's phenomenal so

1192
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:40,618
I've always leaned towards lower P

1193
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,900
levels so I'm really curious to hear uh

1194
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,579
Paul or Patrick what you have to say in

1195
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,280
terms of the research that you did if we

1196
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,300
can move on to your paper how does that

1197
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,440
sound

1198
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,660
yeah

1199
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,240
um I did want to make a comment on the

1200
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:55,019
variable versus continuous phosphorus

1201
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:55,679
rate

1202
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:58,079
um

1203
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,779
I think it also really stems back to

1204
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,660
your production practices

1205
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,960
here we were not pruning nor are we

1206
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:10,139
defoliating the plant because phosphorus

1207
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,099
is stored in those lower leaves and it's

1208
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:13,618
mobile

1209
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,180
so as the plant needs it has the ability

1210
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:16,980
to move them up to those sinks which

1211
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:19,199
would be your developing buds

1212
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,139
so one of the things is that if you are

1213
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,000
not pruning and you're not defoliating

1214
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:26,159
you actually kind of have a small

1215
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,679
storage unit in those lower leaves that

1216
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,480
the plant's able to move up to where the

1217
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:34,019
buds are developing

1218
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,400
so you may not need to boost later in

1219
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:38,219
the production cycle as you're having

1220
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,500
Bud set however if a grower is pruning

1221
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:42,598
or defoliating you are removing those

1222
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,579
nutrients off the plant that could have

1223
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,599
potentially been mobile to go to that

1224
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:48,720
new sink

1225
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,119
so I think with us using a continuous

1226
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:55,139
rate and not pruning we were able to use

1227
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:58,019
those mobile nutrients that were stored

1228
00:47:55,139 --> 00:48:00,539
so that you Growers should also evaluate

1229
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:03,179
their production practice practices but

1230
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:06,500
this is a good starting block for you

1231
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:09,059
know the bare bones of the plant to see

1232
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,880
how phosphorus interacted in the plant

1233
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:14,000
without pruning additional work does

1234
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,579
need to be done with pruning defoliating

1235
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,619
and leaching of the system and flushing

1236
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:23,400
to see you know do you need a boost

1237
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:24,960
later if you remove the phosphorus that

1238
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,619
you store up at a young plant when it's

1239
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,139
not necessarily needed before flowering

1240
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:33,720
yeah that's an excellent point I'm glad

1241
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:37,440
you brought up that comment

1242
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:39,000
um and I do hope we do see more research

1243
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,940
come out around pruning because we have

1244
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,460
a pretty wide range of

1245
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,800
uh cultural practices in the Cannabis

1246
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,318
industry ranging from removing pretty

1247
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,240
much all families to leaving a

1248
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,159
significant amount of canopy

1249
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,299
um so yeah I would love to see that

1250
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:55,799
research

1251
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,370
maybe that's something you guys will do

1252
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,039
someday

1253
00:48:56,369 --> 00:49:02,699
[Laughter]

1254
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:06,480
well let's tell me a little bit about uh

1255
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:09,779
so the so the paper that you authored is

1256
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,000
um with Paul and Dylan Kidd and uh Brian

1257
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,940
whipker is called elevated phosphorus

1258
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,659
fertility impact on Cannabis sativa uh

1259
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:21,240
bayox growth and nutrient accumulation

1260
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:24,299
now what led to you

1261
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:26,759
um your interest I guess and and

1262
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,060
uh formulating this trial and writing

1263
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,060
this paper

1264
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,260
so initially we started off with Paul's

1265
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:35,759
work looking at the lower fertility

1266
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,720
ranges

1267
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,640
and I remember I went into one of the uh

1268
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:43,199
hemp grow stores which was close to

1269
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:44,219
where me and Paul had our research going

1270
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,618
on

1271
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:49,799
and they were selling products that had

1272
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:53,338
close to uh 200 apartment phosphorus in

1273
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:56,460
it and I had I struggled to understand

1274
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:59,219
how I could get or we were getting uh

1275
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:02,039
healthy looking plants at you know 11

1276
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:05,039
and a quarter fifteen Thirty and someone

1277
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:07,559
is selling a product that is 200

1278
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,139
popularly and phosphorus in it

1279
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,539
and you know we were seeing other things

1280
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:15,838
online saying that you really needed to

1281
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:18,539
boost it up even up to the 250 300 range

1282
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,578
and it was uh harder for me to

1283
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:22,619
comprehend why that was needed and why a

1284
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:25,140
grower should invest that much money

1285
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:26,700
when we were able to get results for uh

1286
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:30,539
much less

1287
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:32,818
so Paul and I decided to build upon his

1288
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:34,079
work and expand it further to these

1289
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:37,199
upper rates

1290
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,539
but then also backpedaling to Paul

1291
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,338
Nelson who was a former professor at NC

1292
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,779
State and Josh Henry who was a former

1293
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:45,119
PhD student

1294
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,880
they looked at other floriculture crops

1295
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,640
and phosphorus is growth control

1296
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,400
so as you increase phosphorus to higher

1297
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:55,920
levels you get more internode stretch

1298
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,838
so Paul's work was looking at those

1299
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,420
lower rates where we might have been

1300
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,400
seeing growth control and not seeing as

1301
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,200
much internode elongation

1302
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,940
so we wanted to compare it to what the

1303
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,338
industry was doing and how that affected

1304
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,280
plant growth did we get really lanky

1305
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:13,259
plants that needed to be supported or

1306
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,480
were we controlling that internode

1307
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:18,900
stretch by using less phosphorus while

1308
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,119
still getting the same growth pattern as

1309
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,519
the other two researchers found with

1310
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,099
many other floriculture species

1311
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,960
so this was more of well we know what

1312
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:29,280
happens at lower rates less tests

1313
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,559
against what we're seeing in the

1314
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,140
industry of these uh what we considered

1315
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:37,700
elevated phosphorus compared to what was

1316
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:37,699
needed to be considered healthy

1317
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,720
that's great well take me through your

1318
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,358
paper I guess

1319
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:50,118
um what was the sort of your methodology

1320
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:50,119
and uh what were you measuring

1321
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,659
so I followed a very similar system that

1322
00:51:54,358 --> 00:52:00,900
Paul used I used four different

1323
00:51:56,659 --> 00:52:04,199
phosphorus fertility rates of 15 60 120

1324
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:06,960
and 180 Park a million phosphorus

1325
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:08,578
and this was constant feed and the only

1326
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,740
element that I modified was the

1327
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:13,380
phosphorus rate we held nitrogen

1328
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:15,479
constant uh all the other macros and

1329
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,700
micros constant other than the

1330
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,740
phosphorus so that we try to have that

1331
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:23,279
fair comparison of everything is held

1332
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:25,979
equal but the phosphorus rate

1333
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,559
um so just because we did have high or

1334
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,838
low P doesn't mean that our nitrogen

1335
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,940
changed so that we didn't see impacts of

1336
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:35,279
other elements

1337
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,740
I grew the plants for 12 weeks in total

1338
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,500
four weeks vegetative and eight weeks

1339
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:44,759
reproductive and once again similar to

1340
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,318
Paul's I did not prune trim modify the

1341
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,980
plants

1342
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:48,719
um

1343
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,659
and

1344
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:55,379
at Weeks

1345
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:57,000
12 we looked at plant growth overall and

1346
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,240
nutrient accumulation

1347
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,300
and total Bud weight

1348
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:05,399
but the two studies are very similar in

1349
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,740
how we conducted the research

1350
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,960
we basically had a cut and paste system

1351
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:11,939
for the two where we only modified the

1352
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,199
phosphorus rates that were used to try

1353
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,200
and get that fair comparison

1354
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,460
now do you feel like container side

1355
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:22,558
could have been a limiting factor in

1356
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,119
terms of root growth in your study as

1357
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,260
well or

1358
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,260
did you not see that

1359
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:33,599
uh when I was terminating the experiment

1360
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,759
I didn't notice any root bound plants

1361
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,940
um but I only went out for 12 weeks

1362
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,800
compared to 16 weeks as Paul did and you

1363
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:44,220
know that extra four weeks of vegetative

1364
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,220
growth for Paul's I really think

1365
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:48,899
um increase that biomass a fair bit

1366
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:50,939
potentially looking at a different

1367
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,980
container size maybe going up to a three

1368
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,838
gallon pot instead of a one gallon pot

1369
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,099
we could have seen a little bit of

1370
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:58,799
difference as well

1371
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,838
but uh what as soon as those roots got

1372
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,880
to the side of the container they really

1373
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,799
took off and

1374
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,900
um thrived under all of the phosphorus

1375
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,539
rates

1376
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:12,358
okay so you went

1377
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:15,119
12 weeks total so eight weeks of

1378
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:17,818
veg or reproductive growth and that oh

1379
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,818
sorry you did four weeks of Edge and

1380
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:23,219
then eight weeks of flowering is that

1381
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:25,440
correct correct so you did you did four

1382
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:27,719
weeks shorter than Paul did on the veg

1383
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,500
side not on the flower side

1384
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:33,598
correct all right perfect and uh

1385
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,280
okay I'm looking at table two at 12

1386
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,359
weeks of growth can you kind of tell me

1387
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,359
what your findings were

1388
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:43,980
yes so after 12 weeks of total growth we

1389
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,500
did not see a difference in height

1390
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,358
diameter or total total above ground

1391
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,019
biomass

1392
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:52,980
um

1393
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:55,019
from 15 to 180 everything was similar

1394
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:58,380
I will comment on the height I was

1395
00:54:55,019 --> 00:55:00,838
slightly surprised that as we increased

1396
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,880
all the way up to 180 Park million P we

1397
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:05,880
didn't see a difference in height I

1398
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,619
expected the 180 part million P plans to

1399
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,480
have a little bit more stretch in the

1400
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:10,380
internodes leading to Greater Plant

1401
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,780
height

1402
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,539
but we didn't even see that

1403
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,460
um total budweight was significantly

1404
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:20,159
different

1405
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,318
um however everything here is within two

1406
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:25,440
grams

1407
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:28,318
of the means and

1408
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:33,659
um we don't notice a clear trend

1409
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:34,818
we see it Peak at 60 PPM but then go

1410
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:37,199
down

1411
00:55:34,818 --> 00:55:40,159
and the only difference we could say was

1412
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:43,799
between 60 and 120 but everything is

1413
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:45,960
fairly consistent across all of them and

1414
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,579
I wouldn't say that

1415
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,380
um you know picking one of these rates

1416
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:52,280
will yield you a greater Bud weight

1417
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,280
compared to the others

1418
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,000
yeah that is interesting it

1419
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,039
it doesn't look like there's much of a

1420
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,780
difference like you said over the over

1421
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:04,619
the whole uh

1422
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:07,800
quite a significant range and P rates

1423
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:08,640
you know going from 15 to 180.

1424
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,519
um

1425
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:14,699
did you look at below ground wait wait

1426
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:18,659
at all biomass or anything uh that

1427
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:20,939
wasn't visually assessed root growth

1428
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:22,558
um however we didn't wash Roots like

1429
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,019
Paul did

1430
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,960
um visually we didn't see a difference

1431
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:31,559
however I can quantify a difference for

1432
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:35,059
you but for all these rates they looked

1433
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:35,059
fairly similar visually

1434
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,300
did you

1435
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,800
um

1436
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,980
did you did you notice anything else

1437
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,318
visually amongst the the difference in P

1438
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,000
rates like if you were to walk into the

1439
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:49,500
greenhouse could you see a significant

1440
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,539
difference from one treatment to the

1441
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,980
other if you didn't know

1442
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:54,980
anything about the experiment

1443
00:56:55,139 --> 00:57:00,058
I honestly could not tell any

1444
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:02,699
differences across the board

1445
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:05,160
looking at them we could have

1446
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:07,500
potentially expected a little bit darker

1447
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:10,199
Foliage for those that

1448
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,420
had greater uh

1449
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,399
phosphorus concentrations

1450
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:16,740
however looking across the board of the

1451
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,480
plants they all looked very similar and

1452
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:20,519
we it was very hard to tell that

1453
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,460
anything was different amongst any of

1454
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:25,858
the phosphorus fertility rates

1455
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,960
and did you see any issues of toxicities

1456
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:29,578
or anything like that I'm guessing no if

1457
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,179
you didn't see any real visual

1458
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,180
differences

1459
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,700
so we did not uh we didn't report any uh

1460
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,099
phosphorus toxicity symptoms even

1461
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:42,779
getting up to 180 part per million P

1462
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,900
constant feed

1463
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:48,960
typically when you get phosphorus that

1464
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,920
high you actually see an antagonism with

1465
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,980
iron

1466
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,858
so with having high phosphorus fertility

1467
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:58,079
rates in the plant of taking High P you

1468
00:57:55,858 --> 00:58:01,199
actually will block the plant from

1469
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:05,519
uptaking Iron and

1470
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:08,279
we did not see a clear trend on iron

1471
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:12,179
levels other than

1472
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:13,579
um actually the lower uh phosphorus

1473
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:17,219
fertility rates

1474
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:18,599
shown a lower iron concentration which

1475
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:20,459
is actually backwards from the

1476
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:22,260
anticipated antagonism that's in the

1477
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,440
literature

1478
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,119
um so nothing visually different and we

1479
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,619
didn't see the antagonisms that are

1480
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,119
typically associated with phosphorus

1481
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:31,980
either

1482
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,140
yeah I'm looking at that chart right now

1483
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,639
was there anything else in this in this

1484
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:37,440
chart that you wanted to point out on

1485
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:40,219
the terms of nutrient accumulation in

1486
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,500
the leaf tissue at 12 weeks

1487
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:45,179
so on the 12-week nutrient accumulation

1488
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:50,659
I definitely want to highlight the

1489
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:54,118
phosphorus and we notice down at the uh

1490
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:57,659
15 million p

1491
00:58:54,119 --> 00:59:00,059
we have the lowest uh phosphorus foliar

1492
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,920
concentration which is to be expected

1493
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:04,099
however we notice that we don't really

1494
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:09,059
see a plateau

1495
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:10,380
15 to 60 is a linear increase 62 and 120

1496
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:13,798
they're not different

1497
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:15,180
but even when you get up to 180p it's

1498
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:17,699
significantly different than all the

1499
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:19,500
other ones so you can supply the plant

1500
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:22,199
with as much phosphorus as you possibly

1501
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:24,239
can it seems and it will uptake it

1502
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:26,338
however just because that plant's

1503
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,979
uptaking it we're not seeing that return

1504
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:31,558
in investment on your growth

1505
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,559
so the plants exhibiting luxury

1506
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:36,420
consumption and it is likely that it can

1507
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,460
sequester it very well all day and it

1508
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:41,119
won't antagonize other elements of the

1509
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:43,619
plant and it's good at storing it

1510
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,240
however you're not seeing a return on

1511
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:47,599
that in terms of plant growth in this

1512
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:47,598
study

1513
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:52,798
but you're not seeing any antagonisms

1514
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:55,139
necessarily either at those high doses

1515
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,780
so it's really not you're just wasting

1516
00:59:55,139 --> 01:00:00,058
your money kind of things

1517
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,940
it's not harming the plant but you're

1518
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:05,099
not seeing a benefit of it it's seeming

1519
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:08,099
that it's uh just storing it in a plant

1520
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:09,390
and it's sitting in the leaf not harming

1521
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:09,960
or helping you

1522
01:00:09,389 --> 01:00:10,558
[Music]

1523
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,980
um

1524
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:17,099
so this kind of points to

1525
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:20,039
you know if we can get away with that 15

1526
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:21,559
to 30 range that Paul noted why do we

1527
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:24,119
need to have

1528
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:26,519
108 uh part per million phosphorus

1529
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,380
supplied to the plant when it will

1530
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:30,420
uptake it of course it's not just

1531
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,460
leaching out the bottom of the pot but

1532
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:37,619
you're not seeing that increase in

1533
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:40,199
growth or increase of Bud weight

1534
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:41,760
yeah so

1535
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:43,318
why

1536
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,540
I'm trying to figure this out in my head

1537
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:47,818
as I'm as I'm saying it so

1538
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:51,539
this may not be a complete thought I'm

1539
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:54,119
noticing that the K levels went down

1540
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:57,719
uh or sorry the K levels went up as you

1541
01:00:54,119 --> 01:01:01,019
went from 15 to 180 PPM your calcium

1542
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:04,439
levels went down

1543
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:05,699
is that related to pH at all or I would

1544
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,338
have initially thought that you would

1545
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:11,159
have had greater root biomass

1546
01:01:08,338 --> 01:01:13,858
potentially leading to Greater overall

1547
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:16,519
nutrient uptake with higher P levels but

1548
01:01:13,858 --> 01:01:19,318
that doesn't seem to be the case

1549
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:21,059
how would you

1550
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:22,980
begin to explain

1551
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:25,700
I guess those

1552
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,699
those numbers

1553
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:31,079
uh looking at the uptake patterns for

1554
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:32,639
those

1555
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,900
seeing the

1556
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,900
calcium increase

1557
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:42,659
I'm not aware of any literature that's

1558
01:01:41,338 --> 01:01:44,519
uh

1559
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:47,759
published on

1560
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:50,039
increase in potassium foliar uptake with

1561
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,319
increasing P

1562
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,599
um however we do see that strong Trend

1563
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:57,058
but I also want to point that it's

1564
01:01:54,599 --> 01:02:02,160
following similar to

1565
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:04,200
the phosphorus where that 60 and 120 are

1566
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:07,940
fairly similar as well

1567
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:10,858
um with in being greater than 15

1568
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:14,880
but not necessarily

1569
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:17,098
uh similar to the 180 it kind of seems

1570
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,440
to have plateaus for a while and then

1571
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:20,818
increases once again

1572
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,639
um

1573
01:02:20,818 --> 01:02:28,099
and then for the calcium decrease I'm

1574
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:32,358
not aware of an antagonism between

1575
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:32,359
phosphorus and calcium polar U

1576
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:39,679
H so if if you refer to

1577
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:43,679
um there's a chart called Mulder's chart

1578
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:45,779
m-u-l-d-e-r apostrophe s chart

1579
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,759
um and if you're not aware of this

1580
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:49,740
resource it's a it's a good chart to be

1581
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,000
familiar with it looks kind of weird to

1582
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:52,199
begin with there's a whole bunch of

1583
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
nutrients

1584
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:55,639
um kind of around a circle and a whole

1585
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,219
bunch of arrows going together

1586
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:01,618
but as far as phosphorus is concerned um

1587
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:03,779
you will see an antagonism between

1588
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:05,400
phosphorus and calcium and that's kind

1589
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,579
of what the arrows are indicating you

1590
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,740
know one nutrient May essentially have a

1591
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:12,660
stimulation or a synergism with another

1592
01:03:10,739 --> 01:03:14,639
element so if you get an increase in

1593
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:16,618
phosphorus for example you may get more

1594
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,539
magnesium

1595
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:20,220
um and then if you get phosphorus too

1596
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:23,039
high like Patrick said it can cause

1597
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:25,019
antagonisms with iron and calcium is one

1598
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,880
of those that it can cause antagonisms

1599
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:30,179
with so I would say that that decrease

1600
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,220
is probably uh what we're seeing there

1601
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:34,379
and again this is more of a guideline

1602
01:03:32,219 --> 01:03:36,838
it's going to really depend on what type

1603
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:38,940
of system you're in are you in soil are

1604
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:41,338
you in a substrate are you using you

1605
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:44,159
know water-soluble fertilizers are you

1606
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:46,078
in an organic system so Mulder's shirt's

1607
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,179
more of a guideline in general Trends

1608
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,140
but there are some nuances that could

1609
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:51,779
exist

1610
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:53,759
um like you said Tad um pH is one of

1611
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,040
them

1612
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,760
yeah it's definitely complicated

1613
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:59,460
um

1614
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:02,520
I found it not to be quite as useful for

1615
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,318
me in organic production just because

1616
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:06,900
it's there's so many more variables

1617
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:10,318
associated with it and the nutrient

1618
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,900
cycling from from microbiology just

1619
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,358
contributes a whole other Factor there

1620
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,019
and also another level of buffering I

1621
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:16,739
find

1622
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,719
um

1623
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:21,239
but I my initial thought when I saw

1624
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:23,159
these results was okay there's the

1625
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:24,899
increase in P is probably leading to a

1626
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,239
greater root biomass which means we're

1627
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,160
getting better nutrient uptake which

1628
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,979
explains the k

1629
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:34,318
and then I got calcium and I I didn't

1630
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,280
know quite what to do with that uh they

1631
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,159
kind of threw out the window I thought

1632
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,980
okay well maybe uh the the P the higher

1633
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,899
levels of P are lowering the pH which

1634
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:44,760
would cause maybe less calcium

1635
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,740
availability but

1636
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,480
um that didn't explain the case so

1637
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:51,118
I was just curious what your guys's

1638
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:54,240
thoughts were on that

1639
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:57,599
and actually for the ph and you see this

1640
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:59,459
study it was consistent across all the P

1641
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,240
fertility rates

1642
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:05,880
um so the fertility wasn't or the

1643
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:10,259
phosphorus input was not altering the

1644
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:12,180
substrate pH or the EC that was that

1645
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,859
remained constant across all treatments

1646
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:16,199
here

1647
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:18,960
so how does how does that work because I

1648
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:23,939
would assume that a level of

1649
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:26,579
phosphate that high would lower your

1650
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,400
pH or at least lower your your solution

1651
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:31,798
going in

1652
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,599
more than one of 15 it was that not not

1653
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:35,780
really the case or did you guys buffer

1654
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,780
it

1655
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:42,118
um so we started off with using a custom

1656
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,700
Blended substrate where

1657
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:46,858
we Blended ourselves so we don't have

1658
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:49,798
any inputs coming in other than our line

1659
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:51,960
charge and our wetting agent as well as

1660
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:54,420
the perlite

1661
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,119
um we did not have to buffer the pH at

1662
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:58,559
all in the study

1663
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,858
we use the modified hoaglands so

1664
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:04,140
everything was fairly well balanced

1665
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:07,199
and after 12 weeks we didn't see a

1666
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:07,920
impact on substrate pH

1667
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:11,039
um

1668
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,440
and that is partly by you know trying to

1669
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:17,338
really carefully balance the salts

1670
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,139
and the plant taking them up rapidly but

1671
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:21,539
after 12 weeks of growth we didn't see

1672
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:24,598
any impact on ph or EC

1673
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:26,639
Paul when you were increasing your P

1674
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:29,220
fertility rates the juicy impact on your

1675
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:31,558
pH or you see

1676
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:32,879
yeah so um we didn't we didn't see an

1677
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:34,920
increase either

1678
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,960
um and one one thing I'll piggyback off

1679
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,180
of that is that you know with the

1680
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,298
modified Hopeland solution

1681
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:44,639
um you know you're you're keeping your

1682
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:47,038
water soluble Ion at a constant

1683
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:48,779
concentration but the individual salts

1684
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,660
that you're adding into that recipe will

1685
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,400
change and based on that change we did

1686
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:56,098
have to add in some sodium hydroxide

1687
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,940
into the system to kind of even out some

1688
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:59,818
of those

1689
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,380
um pH charges there so kind of to answer

1690
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:03,599
your question Tad we didn't necessarily

1691
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,280
amend the substrate pH but when when

1692
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,318
we're custom blending these fertilizer

1693
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,660
Solutions sometimes we do have to

1694
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:12,779
increase our sodium hydroxide to kind of

1695
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:14,639
buffer out that increased pH charge that

1696
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:17,400
could be coming from um you know

1697
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:19,798
adjusting some of the salt inputs okay

1698
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,220
gotcha sorry this is not my world I'm an

1699
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:25,079
organic guy so um bear with me when I

1700
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:27,239
don't totally wrap my brain around

1701
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:29,039
exactly how you guys are formulating

1702
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:32,098
these uh

1703
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,020
these fertilizers so I appreciate you

1704
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:36,539
explaining to me

1705
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:39,420
um if I could real quick

1706
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:41,280
um but your your spot on though um Chad

1707
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:45,680
that you know this this Mulder's chart

1708
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:48,240
here is very much a tool for you know

1709
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:50,098
substrate based cons you know

1710
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:51,659
water-soluble ions

1711
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:55,260
um not necessarily

1712
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:57,358
um an organic system so but you know you

1713
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:59,339
you you're spot on in a lot of your

1714
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:02,038
insights here so don't sell yourself

1715
01:07:59,338 --> 01:08:03,538
short man I appreciate it I really

1716
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:04,799
appreciate what you guys are doing and

1717
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:06,720
you know coming on the show to share

1718
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:09,059
this research

1719
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:12,179
um as an organic grower

1720
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:15,620
when we start talking about P rates my

1721
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:18,000
initial thought goes to

1722
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:19,318
well one the environmental impact which

1723
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
we already kind of touched on a little

1724
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:26,699
bit but P solubilizing microbes and

1725
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,640
mycorrhizal fungi and the role of those

1726
01:08:26,698 --> 01:08:31,678
play in making P available because

1727
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,298
typically in an organic system and even

1728
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,319
in a lot of conventional systems we have

1729
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:38,819
high levels of unavailable phosphorus

1730
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,839
and it's really getting available P

1731
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:44,580
that's the big challenge

1732
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:47,039
did I mean your research doesn't exactly

1733
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:49,380
speak to this but did you guys have any

1734
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:51,479
thoughts in on this or anything I

1735
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:54,179
mentioned there as you've been studying

1736
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:58,079
phosphorus so much

1737
01:08:54,179 --> 01:09:00,239
or maybe not yeah no I can I can comment

1738
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:01,859
on that um I was I was given a little

1739
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,500
time buffer there

1740
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:05,819
um but you know you're you're very

1741
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,338
correct

1742
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:10,739
um that once you move into a soil system

1743
01:09:08,338 --> 01:09:13,559
or something more like a living bed or

1744
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:16,678
even an organic system the microbiology

1745
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:18,660
just becomes so much more important

1746
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,000
um and you have you know your adsorption

1747
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:23,399
your desorption of the ions you know

1748
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,140
your complexation as well as you know

1749
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:26,639
what the microbes are going to eat the

1750
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,859
rate of microbial growth and

1751
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,798
mineralization and it becomes just so

1752
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:33,838
much more complex and uh oftentimes you

1753
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:36,119
have to dump a whole bunch more Reserve

1754
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:38,399
phosphorus into that type of system just

1755
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:39,000
to get your plant available

1756
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,000
um

1757
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,939
so you know one one of the things that

1758
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,679
would be just absolutely amazing

1759
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:49,198
um would be looking at the adsorption

1760
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:52,020
and desorption of phosphorus under these

1761
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:53,579
main systems that the industry is using

1762
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:56,219
you know whether that be like a living

1763
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:58,439
bed or actual like you know

1764
01:09:56,219 --> 01:10:01,500
um some sort of soil based

1765
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:04,079
um work so but you know before we get

1766
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:06,539
there there's a few key aspects that

1767
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:08,100
need to be explored such as uptake and

1768
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:10,800
partitioning

1769
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:13,440
um and then reallocation would be

1770
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,300
another but your your spot on Tab that

1771
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,460
you know this this is an extremely

1772
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:19,800
dynamic system and oftentimes your

1773
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,439
reserve or soil PH can be just so much

1774
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:26,719
higher than that um which the plant

1775
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:26,719
available uh concentrations would be

1776
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:32,520
and to kind of go off of that I think it

1777
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,980
really comes back around to

1778
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,900
as a grower what are your production

1779
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:37,559
practices

1780
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,259
um

1781
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,880
so if you're going in a hydroponic

1782
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:43,619
system this kind of acts as a

1783
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,719
Cornerstone to say you can really dial

1784
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:48,960
your phosphorus right back

1785
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:50,880
compared to being in an organic system

1786
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,079
unit you may need to increase it and

1787
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,100
give yourself a little bit more of that

1788
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:55,559
buffer

1789
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:57,420
but this kind of access what is your for

1790
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,659
plant available P how much of that is

1791
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:02,340
needed in certain systems and it's kind

1792
01:11:00,658 --> 01:11:03,839
of a good Cornerstone for wire Growers

1793
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,360
can start to look at

1794
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,179
but

1795
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:11,279
everyone needs to kind of modify this uh

1796
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:13,260
baking recipe for

1797
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:16,259
what they're doing and how it's going to

1798
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:18,840
work for them while this serves as a

1799
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:21,300
good Cornerstone of literature

1800
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:24,300
because it's been all plan available P

1801
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:27,000
those who are using more soil or organic

1802
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:29,940
systems will need to modify it but this

1803
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,679
is a good starting point oh absolutely I

1804
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:33,359
think this research you guys did is is

1805
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,359
huge

1806
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:38,639
I can't thank you enough for it because

1807
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:40,198
at the end of the day as a grower if the

1808
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,820
only takeaway I get from this research

1809
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:44,819
is to start experimenting with lower

1810
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:47,219
rates of phosphorus that could have a

1811
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:48,779
dramatic input on the impact on the

1812
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:51,779
industry in terms of the amount of P

1813
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:54,719
that we really need to mine or purchase

1814
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:58,079
or apply to our plants that's a big deal

1815
01:11:54,719 --> 01:12:00,359
so I hope people will consider you know

1816
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:02,340
experimenting in their facility with

1817
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:04,259
lower rates of pee and see how their

1818
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:06,060
plants respond and if that has an impact

1819
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,920
on yield and I look forward to seeing

1820
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,739
some you know real life

1821
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:13,140
results in you know in the field and see

1822
01:12:10,738 --> 01:12:16,319
if those mirror and Trend along with

1823
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:18,840
what your research has shown

1824
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:20,759
yeah and I'll just I'll piggyback off of

1825
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,679
that again here Tad and say that you

1826
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,920
know this is this is one of the most

1827
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:27,539
exciting areas for me personally

1828
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,039
um you know you can you can be a

1829
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:30,539
scientist and you can do this work and

1830
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:32,640
you can publish it and sometimes it

1831
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:35,279
feels like you're just shouting into the

1832
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,079
the void and so it's it's moments like

1833
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,599
these where people can come alongside

1834
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,819
and talk through the science and then we

1835
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,620
as scientists can learn from you know

1836
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:45,000
people who are in the industry and in

1837
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:46,738
production

1838
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,260
um you know because it's a give and take

1839
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:50,519
right it's a relationship you know we we

1840
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,320
have the science and we hold things

1841
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,360
constant and we you know do this stuff

1842
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,460
but really it it's people like yourself

1843
01:12:54,359 --> 01:12:58,979
doing the amazing work that you're doing

1844
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,779
with the organic stuff and then industry

1845
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:02,939
input and everything you know we're

1846
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:04,800
we're all only going to be better

1847
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:06,019
together

1848
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,420
um so

1849
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:11,840
oh yeah you bring up a great Point like

1850
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:15,600
as as a grower

1851
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:17,460
my challenge is not just finding

1852
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,620
information and research but being able

1853
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,480
to understand that research you know and

1854
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:22,920
not drawing conclusions that may not

1855
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:25,259
necessarily

1856
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:27,179
be accurate or jump into conclusions

1857
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:29,280
based off of one paper and that's where

1858
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:31,079
you know people like you and Patrick can

1859
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:33,000
come in and say oh okay slow down here's

1860
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:34,760
what we can kind of say from our

1861
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,840
research and here's what we can't say

1862
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,820
necessarily at this point but maybe we

1863
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,279
can point you in a direction and then

1864
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:42,719
what what Growers can give back is hey

1865
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,219
this is an area that really needs to be

1866
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,260
researched and something that we need to

1867
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,960
we need to get more data on so we can

1868
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:52,260
make better decisions in the field so I

1869
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,819
love that sort of synergistic

1870
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:56,159
um relationship that I hope we can

1871
01:13:53,819 --> 01:13:57,599
improve on because historically that's

1872
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:01,019
always been a challenge in agriculture

1873
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:04,679
between you know Farmers or Green Cross

1874
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:06,060
Growers and you know Academia so

1875
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,100
it's kind of where this whole podcast

1876
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:11,039
idea came around um so I really

1877
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,659
appreciate you guys sharing this uh

1878
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:14,579
on that note

1879
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:17,279
um I do want to just once again plug

1880
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:19,859
your original paper

1881
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:21,960
um talking about nutrient disorders Paul

1882
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:25,319
I think that paper is is wonderful

1883
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,300
everyone should have it as a resource I

1884
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:28,799
recently shared that poster on our

1885
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,239
Instagram page that you guys put

1886
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,199
together is that something you're ever

1887
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:32,519
going to be

1888
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:34,500
um

1889
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,900
printing or are there other places

1890
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,000
people can find that

1891
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:41,039
yeah no we've we've had so many

1892
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,859
inquiries about printing and everything

1893
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,840
from that and you know we're we're still

1894
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:47,519
trying to figure out how to you know get

1895
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,199
that out there

1896
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,120
um as far as like a printing service

1897
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:53,819
goes and everything

1898
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:56,399
um but eventually yes uh we're hoping to

1899
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:59,279
get that in some sort of form

1900
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:01,198
um but one thing I I will say is um

1901
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,939
we've had a lot of requests over the

1902
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:04,319
years to just kind of have a centralized

1903
01:15:02,939 --> 01:15:05,698
location

1904
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,279
um for all of our research and our

1905
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:10,259
resources and uh Patrick actually has

1906
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:12,960
been spearheading that so I'll let him

1907
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:16,400
kind of talk about that and and kind of

1908
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:20,039
plug the the newest development there

1909
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:22,139
so to kind of build off of the poster

1910
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:24,359
that Paul created that we got a lot of

1911
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:28,320
positive feedback on

1912
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:31,139
um we took that poster in me and Paul

1913
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:33,719
built this website where we house all of

1914
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:35,460
our resources at one location and it's

1915
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:36,300
cannabis scientific and it'll be linked

1916
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,658
below

1917
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:41,820
but we do have each nutrient disorder

1918
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:44,099
has its own tab where you can read the

1919
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,559
description and then we have

1920
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:49,440
for most of them at least one resource

1921
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:52,500
attached below I know phosphorus we have

1922
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:54,419
both of these articles in one or two

1923
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,640
other popular press

1924
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,640
but this website was really to build a

1925
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:02,400
culmination of all of the grower

1926
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,020
magazine and extension alerts that we've

1927
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:05,939
put out as well as our scientific

1928
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,800
research

1929
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:09,539
so for those who are just simply trying

1930
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,640
to diagnose something it's an excellent

1931
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:14,158
place to start and if you want to go

1932
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:15,800
into detail on you know how can I craft

1933
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:18,238
my

1934
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,159
phosphorus rate or my magnesium rates

1935
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,658
you know you can go on there and you can

1936
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:24,059
find more of the in-depth science of

1937
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:26,339
what we observed as well as all of the

1938
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:28,500
images and photos that we've culminated

1939
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:30,840
and put in different places now we

1940
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,238
finally have them all housed in one

1941
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:35,819
location for

1942
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:37,559
people who are trying to problem solve

1943
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:40,439
awesome yeah I'll definitely have that

1944
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,659
link available uh on the podcast page

1945
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:44,399
and where social media allows me to put

1946
01:16:42,658 --> 01:16:46,198
links I know Instagram makes it really

1947
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,759
challenging so we'll definitely have

1948
01:16:46,198 --> 01:16:49,500
that on the podcast page for folks

1949
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,780
that's so cool that you guys make that

1950
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:54,119
available to people

1951
01:16:50,779 --> 01:16:56,158
the last thing I want to touch on and

1952
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:58,559
um hopefully have you back on here soon

1953
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:01,139
guys is to talk about you have another

1954
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,640
paper out called magnesium impact

1955
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:07,500
magnesium's impact on Cannabis sativa

1956
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,179
growth in cannabinoid production I would

1957
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,279
love to get you guys back on soon to

1958
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:14,300
talk about this most recent paper

1959
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,300
talking about magnesium

1960
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:20,100
for sure yeah so that's wonderfully was

1961
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,719
the one that spearheaded that

1962
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,640
um so you know it'll be nice to come

1963
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:25,460
back on because uh I'll be able to take

1964
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,179
the back seat on that one

1965
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:29,760
wonderful well I'm sure we'll get

1966
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:31,440
questions out after this phosphorus uh

1967
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,060
podcast post and maybe we can answer

1968
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,639
those and then tackle this magnesium

1969
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:38,219
paper here soon I really appreciate you

1970
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:41,780
guys uh thanks so much for coming on any

uh just thank you so much for allowing

1973
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:49,979
us to highlight our research and really

1974
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:51,779
get it out to Growers and everyone who

1975
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:53,158
could you know hopefully benefit from it

1976
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:55,500
and thank you for all the work that

1977
