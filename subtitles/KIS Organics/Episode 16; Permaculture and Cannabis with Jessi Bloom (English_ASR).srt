practical permaculture design is a must

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,769
read in my opinion if for no other

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,780
reason than to get you thinking about

53
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,429
how to best utilize and structure your

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,409
farm or garden and get a better

55
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,899
understanding of how permaculture might

56
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,979
apply in your life

57
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,729
Jesse can you go in a little bit into

58
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,500
how you got into

59
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,780
gardening and garden design and thanks

60
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,780
for coming on the show well thanks for

61
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,818
having me um yeah I have a long history

62
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,459
with working with the earth and with the

63
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:26,619
plants and I I'd like to think it

64
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:30,489
started when I was like really young and

65
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,250
just loved being outdoors and making

66
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,700
friends with all the organisms outside

67
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,269
like from insects to plants to all the

68
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:43,378
mammals and animals and I really loved

69
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:45,730
the experience of just being outside and

70
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,979
having relationships with everything I

71
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:52,030
didn't really trust humans at that much

72
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:54,578
as a youngster so when I was starting to

73
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,039
look at careers as I was a teenager I

74
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,810
wanted to work with animals and realize

75
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,939
that animals suffer a lot of abuse and I

76
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,189
couldn't quite stomach it so that well I

77
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:06,098
can learn about plants and make my

78
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:08,949
career around plants because I don't

79
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:11,139
need to watch them suffer which I came

80
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:14,018
to realize that's that was um not

81
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:16,328
correct and once you start feeling into

82
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,310
two plants you can start to see when

83
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,030
they do suffer as I'm sure a lot of

84
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,280
growers can see firsthand but I never

85
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,299
really intended to become what I've

86
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,609
ended up doing for my career I now run a

87
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,060
company that's 20 years in design build

88
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:36,129
firm that does ecological work

89
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,340
for both residential commercial and some

90
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:42,609
government work as well but it started

91
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,729
with just a love for nature and wanting

92
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:49,389
to learn more and my design background

93
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:52,209
just grew out of people asking me for

94
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,239
help and it started with me working in a

95
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:58,030
kind of a residential

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,609
land care setting and people asking well

97
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,019
what can I do for this space that you

98
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,359
know plant may have died or something

99
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,419
and it just grew and grew to the point

100
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:09,579
where I couldn't quite handle it after

101
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:12,359
about ten years and I had to adjust my

102
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,359
life to

103
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:20,409
to make it what I needed and so the

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,349
business is still thriving and it's been

105
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,090
almost 20 years and I'm doing a lot of

106
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:28,180
other things now too

107
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:29,459
I've written three books at this point

108
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,319
and

109
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,719
have been a teacher that travels around

110
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,550
the country and teaching for different

111
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,240
media organizations like Mother Earth

112
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,449
News and I'm doing a lot of writing for

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,210
different magazines now and really

114
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,580
enjoying that aspect of my career but

115
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:50,079
nothing beats being outside and working

116
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,859
with the plants and getting my hands in

117
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,899
the soil yeah I remember going to some

118
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,310
of your first talks at Mother News when

119
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,668
you were doing your free-range chicken

120
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,470
chicken Gardens tour and

121
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:05,109
you've kind of evolved from there onto

122
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,350
the the permaculture and now your latest

123
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,870
book I guess I'm wondering could you

124
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,040
talk a little bit about how

125
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,750
permaculture came into your life and how

126
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,720
that sort of became incorporated into

127
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,939
your design and what you do with your

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,300
business

129
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:25,918
yeah so II when I was in college in the

130
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,000
90s the late 90s I was

131
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,719
entering an industry that I didn't

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,600
really know much about and in the world

133
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,060
of horticulture I expected to learn a

134
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,820
lot about how nature functioned and I

135
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,348
learned like botany and soil science and

136
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,050
and we really focused on a lot of the

137
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:45,339
the foundational

138
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,680
academics of horticulture but we were

139
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:51,728
also learning about like pesticide use

140
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,340
and the things that didn't align with me

141
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:56,740
or resonate at all and I I was you know

142
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:59,319
kind of an angsty young adult at that

143
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,829
time and was kind of pissed off at what

144
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,870
I saw in the industry as a norm and I

145
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:07,029
just understood nature to work

146
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,620
beautifully on its own and so I couldn't

147
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:11,439
really understand like why are we

148
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,090
forcing all these things to grow in a

149
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,550
way that aren't natural we're using all

150
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:16,538
these chemicals that are harmful

151
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,150
and then we're polluting our environment

152
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:23,500
and I at that time was not

153
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,469
really looking for permaculture but it

154
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,329
landed in my lap through a book and that

155
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,250
was written by Bill Mollison I'm called

156
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:31,810
introduction of permaculture and he's an

157
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,269
Australian one of the founders of the

158
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,579
concept

159
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,859
and when I looked at the book at first I

160
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,289
was like oh this is totally common sense

161
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,759
it's like ecological design we don't

162
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,430
need to force nature we just need to

163
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,399
learn how to work with it in harmony to

164
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,519
to meet our own needs and at that time

165
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,019
in the 90s nobody I knew was talking

166
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,539
about permaculture and if I hadn't met

167
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:58,769
someone at that time there was kind of

168
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:00,930
this air about them that I didn't again

169
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:02,729
didn't resonate with and I I just kind

170
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,620
of took my path with permaculture in my

171
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,939
own way and

172
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,639
really followed the ethics and the

173
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,810
principles of

174
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:13,019
taking care of the earth taking care of

175
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,360
ourselves and giving back which that in

176
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:19,139
itself is the foundation of permaculture

177
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,550
is the ethics that it's it's rooted in

178
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,349
and in the like ten years later I want

179
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,920
to say so I ran my business with

180
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:32,820
permaculture and my life to a degree and

181
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,910
in 2010 I was asked to design a garden

182
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,230
for Seattle tilth which is a nonprofit

183
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,290
organization that teaches people how to

184
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:42,540
garden and they wanted me to design a

185
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,660
permaculture garden for the Northwest

186
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,220
Flower and Garden Show and I at first

187
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,740
was just like yes of course this is

188
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,330
super easy and this is like how I live

189
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,810
my life and I couldn't wait to share it

190
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:55,889
with the world and the show organizers

191
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,769
actually said well we're not going to

192
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,269
use that word in describing your garden

193
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,699
because no one understands what it means

194
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:05,669
and so I was like whatever you know it's

195
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:09,029
a it's a lost opportunity but in that

196
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,790
show which the garden was really really

197
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,559
well-received it was called the little

198
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,920
farm in the city and had all kinds of

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,660
great systems set up but a man named

200
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,970
Dave Bain Lyon walked up to me and

201
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,340
anyone who knows Dave long dreadlocks

202
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,680
really jolly attitude walked up and like

203
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,889
hey this is a great permaculture design

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,420
and I was like whoa somebody actually

205
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:33,059
knows it appreciates what that means and

206
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,590
Dave and I developed a friendship he's

207
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,139
an educator over at the Bullock

208
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,930
homestead and has been for many years

209
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:42,299
and we started working together on

210
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:46,439
projects he works more internationally

211
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:49,099
and I'm my business is more local so we

212
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,900
started doing work and ultimately

213
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,050
decided to write a book together after

214
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,509
the chicken book came out and the

215
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:58,099
permaculture book is now I'm really

216
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:01,429
proud of it I think of my books kind of

217
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,230
like my kids the it's written now in

218
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:05,209
five languages and is used as an

219
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,639
academic text in a lot of colleges that

220
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,680
teach permaculture and so I'm really

221
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:14,090
proud of that book and kind of what it's

222
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:17,449
done out in the world so far but when I

223
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,129
met Dave and I started going to the Bois

224
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,340
Locke homestead and they've been doing

225
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:27,350
permaculture for about thirty plus years

226
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:30,500
now I was amazed at how it was used in

227
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,149
real life from not only the business

228
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,090
standpoint but how people were living

229
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,799
off of the land and I left the first

230
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,379
time going to the bullocks going how can

231
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,899
I make my life more like that not just

232
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:44,990
my business but really you know not

233
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:47,629
producing waste and growing as much food

234
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,360
as I could on my own and medicine so

235
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:53,629
that was kind of a big turning point for

236
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,879
me to see it more applied in multiple

237
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:58,250
uses and now I look at permaculture as a

238
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,679
way of life that you can apply towards

239
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,450
anything you can apply it towards your

240
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,729
finances you can apply it towards

241
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,920
relationships

242
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,009
gardening of course is what most people

243
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:12,289
begin to know it from or with but really

244
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,909
you can use it for anything yeah what I

245
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:16,399
love about your book is that it really

246
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:18,559
is that introduction it sort of bridges

247
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,980
the gap between you know people like the

248
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,589
bullocks or people like Dave who are

249
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,170
amazing permaculturist but for the

250
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,930
average person who lives in the house

251
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:32,659
and maybe doesn't you know pee on their

252
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:35,659
plants or live in a year it's a little

253
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:37,939
bit of a challenge to understand how to

254
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:40,279
get from one space to the other so that

255
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,650
that's the best thing I think I can say

256
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,470
about about your book is that it helps

257
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:48,500
people as an introduction into what

258
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,519
permaculture can be before we go any

259
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,320
further though how would you really

260
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,129
define permaculture for people who

261
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,200
aren't as familiar with it so the kind

262
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:01,250
of high level definition I would say is

263
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:05,149
it's a design system or toolkit

264
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:09,259
for human habitat so if you think about

265
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:11,438
how we design like insect habitat or

266
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:14,949
butterfly habitat or any kind of habitat

267
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:17,838
we're looking at how ecological systems

268
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:19,969
work together and you know we're just

269
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,360
another organism on this planet one

270
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,810
species out of millions and we have a

271
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,560
huge impact in all the environment

272
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:33,258
around us so permaculture is a system or

273
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,719
of tools resources to help us make

274
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,839
decisions so that we can live more in

275
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,759
harmony or ecological balance and I

276
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,199
think of it like how we're supposed to

277
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,470
live you know as stewards of the land

278
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:47,539
and the land and the earth offer

279
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,370
everything that we need but we've got

280
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:51,980
some gotten so far removed from that

281
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,049
that the systems that we depend on now

282
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,000
like food systems or water systems and

283
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:59,299
they're on automated and they're out of

284
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,309
our control for the most part and so

285
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:04,789
when I think of permaculture kind of at

286
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:06,859
a high level it's a design system and to

287
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:09,349
relate it to something maybe people are

288
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,199
more familiar with like engineering or

289
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,990
architecture those are also design

290
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,789
systems where you could build all kinds

291
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,240
of things you know from an airplane to a

292
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:21,948
skyrise permaculture designs our

293
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,129
habitats and all the systems that we

294
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:27,740
rely on and but unlike some other design

295
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:30,829
systems permaculture is rooted in ethics

296
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,709
and I always say like if you take

297
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:34,628
nothing else away from

298
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,669
permaculture as an introductory

299
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:39,050
understand that the ethics are probably

300
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:42,110
the most important thing and there's

301
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:44,088
several of them but the three most

302
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,339
important or foundation are taking care

303
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,860
of the earth and so when we make

304
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,779
decisions how are we making a decision

305
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,568
that impacts the earth and every single

306
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:54,980
thing we do in life impacts our

307
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:56,539
environment so whether it's what are we

308
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,970
eating what are we fertilizing our

309
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:01,250
plants with how are we spending our

310
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,350
money how does that impact the earth and

311
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,620
then the second ethic of caring for

312
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,659
people and if people aren't taken care

313
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,860
of or their needs aren't met they're not

314
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:12,588
going to be able to take care of the

315
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,029
earth and it starts with ourselves first

316
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:18,030
and making sure that our own need

317
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:21,059
they're met and then taking care of

318
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:23,429
others around us and that's one that

319
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,139
doesn't get a lot of like a lot of

320
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:27,659
people don't talk about it with

321
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,120
introductory to permaculture because

322
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,610
people are usually focused on garden

323
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,139
related things but I like to put a lot

324
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,509
of emphasis on that because it's really

325
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,100
important to take care of people as they

326
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:39,830
are the ones impacting the earth and

327
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,779
then

328
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,950
there's fair share that's another ethic

329
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:48,750
that is kind of the altruistic

330
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,580
element or layer where we when we have

331
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,860
an abundance of something we should

332
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,110
share and give back and then it comes

333
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,399
full circle to whether it's taking care

334
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,269
of people are taking care of the earth

335
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:04,110
if you have an abundance of crop or time

336
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:06,240
or knowledge and like this podcast that

337
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,639
you do could be considered giving back

338
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,019
you're sharing your knowledge and other

339
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,299
people's knowledge with your listeners

340
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:15,539
so there's a lot of ways we can do it or

341
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:18,479
look at that but that's where I always

342
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,069
start with permaculture because some

343
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,320
people could think of it as like just an

344
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,020
organic gardening method but that's

345
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,910
really just one small well not small

346
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,809
necessarily but it's one piece of it

347
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:33,659
that we look at whereas everything we do

348
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:36,750
in life is impacted by our decisions and

349
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:39,360
if we start with the ethics first then

350
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,789
we can start living in more harmony with

351
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,460
the environment we're in I think that's

352
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:47,969
really important that we look at it

353
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,650
beyond just a gardening system design

354
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,350
how would you say that people could use

355
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:54,110
it outside of gardening as an example

356
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,790
like I know you had mentioned

357
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,009
engineering and architecture but how

358
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:00,929
would a company or someone in their life

359
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,210
incorporate permaculture even if they

360
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:06,179
weren't a gardener at all well there's a

361
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,540
lot of ways it's kind of endless as far

362
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:11,809
as like the the ways that we can apply

363
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,620
it but it's it's a design system so

364
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:15,329
usually when we're designing something

365
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,340
we usually have a problem or a goal that

366
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,330
we're trying to achieve so with a

367
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,070
business for example we could look at

368
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,410
first analyze what we're what we're

369
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,560
doing and what we want to change so say

370
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:30,350
we have a goal of zero weight which is

371
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,458
one of the permaculture principles

372
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,180
because nature doesn't produce waste

373
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:37,619
right so how can we live or run our

374
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,469
businesses in a way that we're not

375
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,139
producing a lot of garbage and and we

376
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,569
would analyze first well how much

377
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,759
garbage are we producing and what ways

378
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:49,799
can we start to eliminate garbage and

379
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,568
this was a lesson like going to the

380
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,068
bullocks I learned like in the first

381
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:55,438
three-day visit I had with them I

382
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:57,958
produce a zero waste and even from my

383
00:15:55,438 --> 00:16:00,539
body the waste that I produce went back

384
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,309
to the ecosystem and businesses it's a

385
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:05,099
little bit more difficult because we use

386
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:08,309
like shipping plastics and we use things

387
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,769
that maybe aren't biodegradable that we

388
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:12,088
can compost and so one of the first

389
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,188
steps we can do is look at okay well

390
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,829
what kind of packaging or what are we

391
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:20,099
using that we could change to be

392
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:22,609
something that is biodegradable or can

393
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,670
be put back into the earth and there's

394
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,810
because of word like talking about a

395
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:30,659
fictional business it's hard to give

396
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:34,169
examples or specifics but that's just

397
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:36,509
one way to start the process so if we're

398
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:39,838
talking about growing for example and I

399
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:42,269
know we'll get more into this but we're

400
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,790
going to want to look at like what kind

401
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:48,240
of inputs or resources we're bringing

402
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:50,789
into the systems so say we need a lot of

403
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,250
fertilisers to grow our crop where are

404
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:55,500
those fertilizers coming from how can we

405
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,198
start to look at producing our own

406
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,500
fertilizers potentially or having

407
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:03,750
something that produces nutrients and

408
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,909
minerals naturally so that we don't have

409
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,130
to buy them and really it's about

410
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:12,419
creating sustainability or closed loops

411
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:14,939
so a truly sustainable system isn't

412
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,549
going to require inputs from outside

413
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,669
that system when I think of landscaping

414
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:22,470
or gardening and I think the the

415
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,360
ultimate goal is that the landscape

416
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,850
could take care of itself it wouldn't

417
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,689
really require a lot from us whether

418
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:32,668
it's an irrigation long-term or constant

419
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,830
fertilization we should have the

420
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:36,780
ecosystem working the way that nature

421
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:38,699
works naturally because you walk out

422
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,190
into the forest and there's nobody

423
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,809
irrigating the forest

424
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,299
it happens naturally the plants are

425
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:48,089
adapted to the climate right there's not

426
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,190
people out there weeding and forcing the

427
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:53,339
plants to do what they want but that's a

428
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,830
human element that we have to start

429
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:59,009
considering when we are creating our own

430
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:03,149
habitat or we're creating a product or a

431
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:05,250
system that is unnatural by ecological

432
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,380
standards ok so let's dive in a little

433
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:11,549
bit to the gardening aspect of it so

434
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,380
when you step on to a new site or a new

435
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,509
property what are the first things that

436
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,330
you look at in terms of evaluating it

437
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:19,920
and starting that process

438
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:23,339
um so there's there's layers the

439
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,640
ecological layers I start with so um the

440
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:29,519
first thing is the solar budget so how

441
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,820
much Sun is the land getting naturally

442
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:35,190
how much shade is where so that changes

443
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:37,679
throughout the year so that's number one

444
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,289
and you can do that pretty easily even

445
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,110
through like image images from satellite

446
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,759
like Google image or Google Earth so

447
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,319
that's actually something I do before I

448
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,069
even get to the property as I look at

449
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:52,109
the land through satellites I do

450
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:53,970
research with topo maps with soil Maps

451
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:56,189
depending on how large the property is

452
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,410
and sometimes you just have to be on the

453
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,710
ground to figure that stuff out but when

454
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,990
I am on the land and I can start looking

455
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,299
at other layers that you can't see

456
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,019
necessarily through the computer like

457
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:13,379
soil and specifics with soil water

458
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:15,750
waters huge depending on what climate

459
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,850
we're in we either have way too much or

460
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,799
not enough

461
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:21,839
oftentimes we have to find that balance

462
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,619
of how do we capture the water on-site

463
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,299
and use it in a way that

464
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:31,429
it were really taking care of that water

465
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:34,909
supply and the other layers may be

466
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:38,160
insects or other organisms that were

467
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:40,920
needing for habitat we could be looking

468
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,350
at fungal presence we could be looking

469
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,900
at the existing plants and kind of what

470
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,240
shape they're in and all of that is

471
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,680
really reading the landscape but one of

472
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,650
the bigger aspects of my job is making

473
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:58,350
sure that the human or whoever wanting

474
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,120
to use the land their goals are

475
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:01,279
realistic with what the land can offer

476
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,409
and

477
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,849
that's that's where my job becomes a

478
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,590
little bit more difficult because I can

479
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:09,269
look at any landscape and go okay well

480
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:11,839
this is what the land came landscape can

481
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:13,619
support but if someone has an idea of

482
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,839
you know they're going to have a high

483
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:18,750
production you know vegetable farm for

484
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,029
example but yet they bought a piece of

485
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,190
land that has a pretty intact forest

486
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:26,759
it's like well there's a conflict there

487
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:29,279
so we have to kind of step back and talk

488
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,609
about the human expectations the needs

489
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,069
of the human and how the land landscape

490
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:36,808
can support that in a way that remains

491
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:39,058
ecological rather than you know

492
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:42,829
clear-cutting and then growing

493
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:47,329
everything we're removing a big part of

494
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:50,339
the ecosystem when we're doing that so

495
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:53,129
my job is every job is different when I

496
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:55,740
go out to a site every every client is

497
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,900
different and usually a lot of people

498
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,339
when they are looking at permaculture

499
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,530
they want kind of a plug in play

500
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:04,169
prescriptive responsive like alright

501
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:06,389
well what can I plant here and what's

502
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,650
the what's the five plants that are

503
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,200
going to do the best and it's like well

504
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,730
I could list off 50 plants but which

505
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,460
ones are you going to use and take care

506
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,860
of and really know how to nurture so

507
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,529
that they can feed you so there's a lot

508
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:23,459
to look at and it's a pretty I guess

509
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,899
complex way of designing but ultimately

510
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,340
we want to make sure that the ecosystem

511
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,750
is sound and sustainable

512
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:33,240
once it's established and that the human

513
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,400
is happy because how often do you see a

514
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,940
landscape that's not taken care of and

515
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,980
and people then consider it a burden or

516
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,259
they start to use chemicals or something

517
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,640
that then isn't taking care of the

518
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,079
ecosystem I know that most of

519
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,450
permaculture is focused around growing

520
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:54,779
food and vegetables how would you

521
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:58,740
incorporate permaculture concepts into

522
00:21:54,779 --> 00:22:01,799
cannabis cultivation well it depends on

523
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,870
the intention of the people growing the

524
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,819
cannabis so if it's I would look at it

525
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:07,500
differently if it was commercial like if

526
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:10,649
people are trying to make money off of

527
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,230
it that's one one way of designing and

528
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,300
then if people are just growing it for

529
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,490
their own personal use and I would treat

530
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,649
those two clients completely different

531
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,990
because if we're looking at making money

532
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,060
we have to have our systems dialed in a

533
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,660
lot more and we have to really maximize

534
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:29,789
space in a way that the room for error

535
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,220
is less but we always got to start

536
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:34,379
somewhere and depending on that person's

537
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,620
experience they may come to the table

538
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,440
with a lot of knowledge with how to do

539
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:43,619
it synthetically but with permaculture

540
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,230
we really want to shift everything to

541
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,519
organic I mean that would be the the

542
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,829
best way and from my personal

543
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,879
perspective or opinion is you know not

544
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:56,039
to use chemicals to grow medicine so

545
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,210
soil fertility is a big aspect of that

546
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,399
you know a plant that in takes a lot of

547
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,980
nutrients and minerals we have to really

548
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,509
figure out where those replacement

549
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,819
minerals and nutrients are going to come

550
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:10,980
from and to do that sustainably and

551
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:13,879
using products that aren't imported from

552
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,099
you know halfway across the world

553
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:20,520
another thing to look at with cannabis

554
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:23,250
or any crop really is water use that's a

555
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,410
huge aspect of making sure that our

556
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,450
water needs are taken care of and we're

557
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,279
not wasteful with water but if we can

558
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,069
capture it from the sky that's truly

559
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:35,039
sustainable and there's a lot to

560
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:38,250
consider with design though and that in

561
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,649
that system alone and energy use so

562
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,420
again with cannabis there's this

563
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,400
spectrum of growers right we've got

564
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,160
people who are doing it inside people

565
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,190
who are doing it outside and if we're

566
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,500
doing it inside then we're using a lot

567
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,570
of electricity some of the growers that

568
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,339
I've visited that's one of their biggest

569
00:23:54,569 --> 00:24:01,740
expenses so how can we start to look at

570
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,769
different ways of producing energy or

571
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,109
getting off-grid like is solar an option

572
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:10,349
can we do things to raise temperatures

573
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:12,240
or to have light be something that we

574
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:14,039
can adjust a little bit easier there's

575
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,660
there's all kinds of things to look at

576
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,759
but if we're going outside of course

577
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,730
we're going to have less control of the

578
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,379
environment but that also has more

579
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,769
opportunity to bring in insects to

580
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,660
create more ecosystem and habitat so

581
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,789
that the plants can then be supported by

582
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,440
other plants

583
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:34,829
the one of the concepts we can use

584
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,740
outdoors is companion planting we can

585
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:41,970
actually invite insects that are

586
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:45,269
predators to the pests and use those as

587
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:48,029
allies to the crop so that's kind of

588
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:50,730
another fun thing to play with and it

589
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,009
works really well in vegetable gardens I

590
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,769
think of cannabis kind of like tomatoes

591
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,169
like they're not super easy to grow

592
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:00,349
they're little finicky if they're not in

593
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,850
the perfect conditions and

594
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:05,369
you know there's pests there's there's

595
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:08,668
issues that plants can have and so how

596
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:11,639
can we look at nature as a resource to

597
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:13,140
take care of those potential issues or

598
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,570
prevent them from happening potentially

599
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,130
in the first place so just to give some

600
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:19,710
concrete examples of some of the things

601
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,200
you talked about now for example if you

602
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,779
were a if you're growing five plants for

603
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,269
your own medical garden or your own your

604
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,819
own use you may be able to add a rain

605
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:31,740
barrel off of your garden shed for

606
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:35,099
example as a way to collect enough water

607
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,009
for that garden or for our property we

608
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,709
have an 85 foot by 30 foot greenhouse

609
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:43,200
that we added gutters to so we're able

610
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,779
to collect a massive amount of water

611
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,460
that comes off of those into giant IBC

612
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,579
totes that we can then use to water the

613
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,160
garden so water catchment is definitely

614
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:54,259
something you can look at there you

615
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,509
talked about

616
00:25:54,259 --> 00:26:00,359
insects as another as another thing

617
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:02,669
through pollinator plants so you're

618
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:05,668
looking at planting not just a mono crop

619
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:07,980
of cannabis or whatever cash crop you're

620
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,650
growing but incorporating in other

621
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,950
plants that may either offer the ability

622
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,200
to accumulate minerals and nutrients out

623
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,298
of the soil like my comfrey or borage

624
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,819
but also things that are going to

625
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:23,279
attract good beneficial insects do you

626
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:27,089
have any particular plants that you like

627
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,960
as just general pollinator plants

628
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:34,278
well there's entire families of

629
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:37,369
plants that are are known to attract

630
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:40,339
specific predator insects anything like

631
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:42,618
in the carrot family so fennel is a good

632
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:44,238
one or or carrots if you want to let

633
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:46,519
them go to seed but of course there's a

634
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:47,749
lot of like little details to think

635
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,479
about if you're trying to grow these

636
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:52,969
things to produce more than that yarrow

637
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:57,830
is one of my favorite insect plants

638
00:26:52,969 --> 00:27:00,440
there's really a bunch of them and a lot

639
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:03,829
of it may depend on climate or exposure

640
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,499
like if say you have rows of crops

641
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:08,658
around the outside or the perimeter

642
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:10,489
maybe like along the fence for example

643
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:12,979
you can have a pollinator mix and

644
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:15,798
there's seed companies that are now

645
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:18,739
starting to make these a lot of them are

646
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:21,348
really they grow in abundance like

647
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:23,149
calendula for example you can just plant

648
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,528
a few of them and every year you're

649
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:27,378
going to have more and more because they

650
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:31,608
germinate so easily from their own seeds

651
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:35,478
but there's there's a lot of them maybe

652
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:38,358
it's you know to target a very specific

653
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:41,389
pests that someone struggling with but I

654
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:45,108
look at the more diversity the better

655
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:47,118
because the more insects you have the

656
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:50,569
less predator or pest populations you're

657
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:53,388
going to have because when there's a you

658
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:56,298
know just one type of pest and not a

659
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:59,538
predator there's going to be population

660
00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:01,608
growth and so the more insects you can

661
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:03,558
bring in to kind of stabilize that or

662
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:06,048
you know eat those insects take care of

663
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,548
it the better and sometimes you don't

664
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:10,098
know like one year you might have a

665
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:11,148
problem with one thing and the next year

666
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:14,358
you might have a problem with another

667
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:16,218
thing so it's important to have as many

668
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:18,579
plants as possible in my own opinion

669
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:22,308
that's where I've seen the most success

670
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:25,038
versus just one type but there's lots of

671
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:27,648
seed mixes and some do better in some

672
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,108
climates than others so it's hard to

673
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:32,418
give specifics not knowing the land also

674
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:36,378
so I try to stay away from that but I

675
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:38,869
can say calendula yarrow there those are

676
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:41,628
two of my favorites fennel attracts a

677
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:43,398
lot but there's there's a ton basically

678
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:44,868
anything that attracts insects is

679
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:47,209
probably good and a lot of them are our

680
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:50,058
flowers that are beautiful so not only

681
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,679
are you getting I'm help with with pests

682
00:28:50,058 --> 00:28:54,079
but you're getting beauty at the same

683
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,690
time yeah and I do just want to caution

684
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,369
listeners that when you do add a

685
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,308
pollinator mix which we've done in our

686
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:03,289
greenhouse multiple years you you are

687
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:05,029
creating a little bit more work for

688
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:07,879
yourself in that these plants also need

689
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:10,399
to be maintained so as they they die you

690
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,299
may increase a presence of fungal spores

691
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,360
or powdery mildew though not all mildews

692
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:19,730
are I guess prevalent across all species

693
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,740
of plants so just because there's mildew

694
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:24,789
say on your comfrey doesn't mean that it

695
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:27,500
can transfer to your cannabis plant but

696
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,690
the potential is there and so what I

697
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,099
find is depending on the pollinator mix

698
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,220
that I've used in the past will really

699
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:36,769
determine how much extra labor I have in

700
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:40,130
terms of maintaining not just that but

701
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:42,109
my actual crop that I'm growing so it's

702
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,790
just something to be aware of and then

703
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:46,399
some of these like you mentioned self so

704
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:48,529
and so you have to be ready for that and

705
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,870
be aware that certain ones you may want

706
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:52,668
to get before they seed something like

707
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:54,589
borage for example you'll have hundreds

708
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:58,190
of borage plants popping up but they're

709
00:29:54,589 --> 00:30:00,949
super easy to pick out of the ground so

710
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,360
it's not a huge big deal but something

711
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,400
to be aware of when your companion

712
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,409
planting I like to run our stuff

713
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,769
sometimes a little further away from our

714
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,330
actual crop but in the same area so one

715
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:15,349
of the things you worked with us on was

716
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:16,699
putting comfrey around our vegetable of

717
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:19,359
our vegetable beds that we do are you

718
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,150
pick out of and that allows us to

719
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,918
create a weed barrier it's for those

720
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,840
weed seeds because those leaves are so

721
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,820
large I know a Bullock's farm they've

722
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,689
used different squashes as a way of

723
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:34,700
doing that and then we can cut down a

724
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,160
couple times a year that comfrey and

725
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,600
apply it throughout our garden as a

726
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,250
natural mulch that's going to provide

727
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,789
more nutrients it's going to keep down

728
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:46,099
extra weeds it has a ton of benefits

729
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:49,000
mm-hmm it's one of the super plants it

730
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:52,359
has a it basically hits every ecological

731
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,009
mark that you would want from a plant

732
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:57,009
pollinator medicinal it's a great

733
00:30:55,009 --> 00:31:00,048
medicinal it's a great root barrier

734
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:02,700
green manure it's got a lot of calcium

735
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:05,670
and it's leaves so it's got a lot of

736
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,130
really great benefits yeah yeah though

737
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,730
we're still fighting it where people

738
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,550
transplanted into the middle of the

739
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,490
garden and that's been a real challenge

740
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:17,549
yes to remove but we already talked

741
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,670
about that on previous podcasts so great

742
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:23,369
so in terms of

743
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:25,440
permaculture and some of the science

744
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:27,809
aspect one of the listeners was asking

745
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,120
about that can you talk a little bit

746
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:32,940
about what sort of science may may or

747
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,019
may not support these permaculture

748
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,100
principles well it's funny because I

749
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:41,210
come from a scientific or academic

750
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:44,969
background and I

751
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:48,230
got into permaculture because I I felt

752
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,910
that it was common sense and saw results

753
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:54,210
with it but didn't need science to

754
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:57,930
validate it for me science is expensive

755
00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:00,450
and not a lot of people in permaculture

756
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:03,450
are necessarily doing a lot of science

757
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,279
there is some out there but it's it's

758
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,269
one of those things that just like

759
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,970
herbal medicine people have been doing

760
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:13,859
these things for a lot of years in fact

761
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:17,640
a lot of permaculture principles come

762
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:20,250
from indigenous cultures like that took

763
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,860
care of the land long before the

764
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,410
Industrial Revolution and when living

765
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:28,439
locally was really the only way to do it

766
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,660
and there wasn't science back there back

767
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,789
that at that time telling people what to

768
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,700
do they just did what they had learned

769
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,909
and observed over time and I one of the

770
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,370
examples I like to use and actually it

771
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:44,820
relates to you and how I met you when

772
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:47,459
when I was maybe like what 12 years ago

773
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,619
now when compost tea was something that

774
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,120
in the industry was kind of looked down

775
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:54,119
upon because there wasn't enough

776
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:58,079
peer-reviewed science and I went to a

777
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,119
conference actually where your dad spoke

778
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,129
and

779
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,589
learned about compost tea and I was a

780
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:06,210
little bit skeptical because of course

781
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:07,740
I'm reading the trade magazines where

782
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,920
it's like oh there's not science behind

783
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,309
this and it's snake oil whatever and my

784
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,400
partner at the time wanted to experiment

785
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:20,009
with it and so got a brewer and we got

786
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,200
started and the results spoke for

787
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:24,029
themselves I didn't need science at that

788
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,940
point I was like wow why isn't everybody

789
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:28,440
doing this and it makes so much sense to

790
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,900
me and of course there's a lot more out

791
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,059
there now about that specific topic but

792
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,310
science hasn't always been around but

793
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,769
we've been around for a really long time

794
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:40,710
and the way that we've interacted with

795
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:43,230
the landscape and with plants has been

796
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,569
like a something that's been passed down

797
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,269
orally so the book that I just finished

798
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:50,309
writing one of my tasks was to look at

799
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:54,539
plants and how they were used you know

800
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:56,940
five six thousand years ago and how that

801
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:59,819
that knowledge was carried down over the

802
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,769
years but it's just now like literally

803
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:05,009
in the past hundred years becoming

804
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:07,559
validated by science it's like do you do

805
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:10,769
we really need it or can we learn for

806
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,628
ourselves and I it's a hard it's a hard

807
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:15,148
balance especially in this world because

808
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:16,069
with something like nature you can't

809
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:19,190
reproduce

810
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:22,620
an ecosystem indoors or in a laboratory

811
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:25,889
so it's hard but one of the questions

812
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:28,648
that comes up a lot that I can speak

813
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,628
about like dynamic accumulation and I

814
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:32,878
know this is something that people asked

815
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:34,409
well where's the science behind and it's

816
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,449
it's pretty soft science there's not a

817
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:39,480
lot out there because not a lot of

818
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:41,699
people are looking into it a lot of the

819
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,940
science is going towards synthetics and

820
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,759
it's going towards GMOs and it's going

821
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,500
towards really altering plants not

822
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,530
necessarily investigating the ones that

823
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,148
we could use easily so dynamic

824
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,360
accumulation for anyone who doesn't know

825
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:59,549
the concept is pretty simple

826
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,590
in that plants use their roots they

827
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,390
mined into the soil they absorb

828
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,120
nutrients and minerals and then store

829
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:08,670
them in their tissues right so we know

830
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,429
this happens with plants because you

831
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,920
know we eat plants and therefore we eat

832
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:17,129
the minerals and nutrients like bananas

833
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,659
you know have potassium for example one

834
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,390
of the things that we just talked about

835
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:23,759
comfrey is known for its ability to

836
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:26,579
accumulate calcium which is kind of an

837
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,410
unusual thing and we're taught you know

838
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,199
we're supposed to get calcium from milk

839
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:33,690
but we it's there in that plant in a way

840
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,358
that it's it's so concentrated that it's

841
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:40,200
been used for 5000 years as a healer of

842
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:42,598
bones so the science is is there it's

843
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:45,328
just not necessarily wrapped in a

844
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,859
permaculture package of like here here's

845
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:49,170
what permaculture can offer you it's and

846
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:51,838
it's again it's not prescriptive so

847
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,519
every single site and every single human

848
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,619
and their needs are going to be

849
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,559
different and so there's not really a

850
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,599
way to replicate that in a lab and look

851
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,700
at it and try to figure out success

852
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,670
because you know we could set up or

853
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:07,230
design an amazing

854
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:10,170
sustainable system for someone to be

855
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:13,469
completely self-sufficient and all it

856
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:16,170
takes is a human error or maybe you know

857
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:18,689
a fencing error for an entire crop to be

858
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,269
wiped out so you know we're not we're

859
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,309
kind of at the hands of nature to some

860
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:26,818
degree but also our own our own

861
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:29,400
experience and if we if we look at

862
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:31,949
permaculture as only something you know

863
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,048
that will accept if area of science is

864
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:36,568
behind it we've got a ways to wait

865
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:38,670
because um you know I don't know anybody

866
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:40,588
who's putting their money towards that

867
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,230
right now they're experimenting with

868
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:44,670
their land and they're trying to

869
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:49,289
practice these things in real time and

870
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:50,608
when I was traveling to research for the

871
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:52,589
permaculture book that was one of my

872
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:55,469
tasks which was super fun and I got to

873
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:58,440
go all over the country and meet people

874
00:36:55,469 --> 00:37:00,358
who were practicing permaculture and one

875
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,599
of my questions is you know like what

876
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:04,949
failures have you seen and

877
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,420
everyone has experienced failures in

878
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:09,210
gardening like that's one of the things

879
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,130
that we learn from and it's different

880
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,778
for every single person and that may be

881
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,140
just their expectations of what a

882
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:19,619
success successful crop may be but

883
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:23,219
there's not a lot of hard science out

884
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,559
there to support these concepts unless

885
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:28,348
you look at it purely from an ecological

886
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:30,569
standpoint but human expectations are

887
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:33,750
kind of what gets in the way of you know

888
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:36,058
what is successful what's working what's

889
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:39,349
not and again there's a lot of error

890
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:42,210
that can happen because of our choices

891
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:44,340
so yeah you touched on a lot things

892
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,470
there that I want to kind of review so

893
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,019
in terms of going all the way back to

894
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:50,459
dynamic accumulators one thing I want to

895
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:53,219
point out for people that I think is a

896
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,590
challenge as well is if that company for

897
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:58,589
example is planted in soil that is low

898
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,539
in calcium that leaf tissue is not going

899
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,160
to magically accumulate high levels of

900
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,130
calcium if it's not available in the

901
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,289
soil so you see these I see these lists

902
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,119
online all the time of various plants

903
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,889
and then the amount of nutrients that

904
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,900
they're supposedly going to be imparting

905
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:15,809
same with or when they're used as

906
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,269
fertilizers and I think those lists can

907
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:20,039
be really misleading for growers because

908
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:22,530
you don't know that there's going to be

909
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,960
10% calcium and that leave tissue just

910
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,790
because just because you don't know the

911
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,829
quality in which or the way in which

912
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:31,710
that crop was grown and you can see a

913
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:33,179
huge variance in any farmer will tell

914
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,730
you that their crops can vary quite a

915
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:38,039
bit just based on the soil conditions

916
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:41,010
that they're growing on and then yeah in

917
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:44,940
terms of permaculture and the science

918
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:46,980
aspect you mentioned how we met I know

919
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,780
when I first met you I was very

920
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,260
skeptical of the term permaculture

921
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:54,269
because basically everyone I had met up

922
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,090
to that point before meeting you and

923
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:59,340
Dave really came across really a little

924
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,780
bit arrogant to me in terms of oh you're

925
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,360
not doing permaculture you don't know

926
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,590
about permaculture

927
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,140
and when you came out to our property

928
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,150
and looked at our farm you kind of

929
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:10,650
shocked me I don't remember this but you

930
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,139
we started walking around and you're

931
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,519
like tad this is a permaculture concept

932
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,650
right here you're already doing some of

933
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,059
these things and

934
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,980
for me like the stuff that you were

935
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:22,230
pointing out like you said was very it's

936
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,199
some of what permaculture is is very

937
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:27,840
common sense and to me that's one thing

938
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:31,079
that separates it from people that are

939
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,420
into you know bio dynamics for example

940
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,860
or

941
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,480
the energies associated around water

942
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,309
these things that have not been proven

943
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,500
and there's not a lot of science behind

944
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:42,599
the thing about permaculture is a lot of

945
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,139
these concepts are design concepts

946
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:48,569
they're common-sense concepts and

947
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:51,449
ultimately the the main purpose of them

948
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:54,570
is really to take care of the earth and

949
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:56,819
to take care of the the property that

950
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,110
we're growing on and

951
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,450
for that to happen I think it doesn't

952
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,309
have to be as science focused but that

953
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:05,439
doesn't mean we can't apply science to

954
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:07,570
it like you mentioned compost tea well I

955
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,730
know a lot of these protocols of people

956
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:12,450
are using compost teas well that doesn't

957
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,800
mean they couldn't use the available

958
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,659
body of knowledge that's already out

959
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,400
there around that science and apply it

960
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:21,519
towards the way that they're making the

961
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,380
compost tea so we can take aspects of

962
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,570
science and apply it to aspects of

963
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,180
permaculture it's not that permaculture

964
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,660
is necessarily anti science it's just

965
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:32,859
that not everything that is happening is

966
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:35,109
happening because of science it's

967
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,410
happening because of like you mentioned

968
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:40,960
the ethics around these principles are

969
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:43,269
number one yeah and I think it's really

970
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
important also to say that in order to

971
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:48,219
practice permaculture it's really

972
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,560
helpful to have science as a foundation

973
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,779
in understanding the ecological systems

974
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,539
like understanding soil science that's

975
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,690
critical in being able to manage soil

976
00:40:55,539 --> 00:41:00,909
fertility and to grow crops and you know

977
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,039
the the hydrology of a site that's

978
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:05,889
really important to look at as well and

979
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:10,119
there's there's a lot of science that is

980
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:13,089
important to know in just beginning but

981
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,250
I I like people to just experiment and

982
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,809
to try of course it's different when

983
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,570
you're trying to make money from systems

984
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:21,579
but in a home environment there's

985
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:23,369
definitely steps that you can take to

986
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,019
just get started and

987
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:30,280
one thing that I experience a lot or see

988
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:32,949
people have is analysis paralysis where

989
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,530
they won't move forward until they have

990
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:37,779
all the answers they're seeking and you

991
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:40,840
can waste a lot of time and your own

992
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,840
learning in trying to you know find

993
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,420
someone else's answers but it it all

994
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,858
starts with soil it starts with the

995
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:52,240
science it starts with understanding

996
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:54,190
those basic ecological systems yeah you

997
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,379
know I hope people will look into

998
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,780
permaculture hopefully this talk will

999
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,369
encourage people to consider it and I

1000
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,220
think your book is a great resource for

1001
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:04,539
people looking for an introduction let's

1002
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:06,339
take a commercial facility that's

1003
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:08,949
already growing and it could be an

1004
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,210
indoor one or a greenhouse one and my

1005
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:12,829
hope is that well rather than like you

1006
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,990
mentioned getting paralyzed by trying to

1007
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:17,809
get to zero waste for example which is a

1008
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:20,899
really really tough goal how about

1009
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:23,139
instead let's do let's source one

1010
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,630
amendment or one fertilizer source

1011
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:28,369
closer to home or let's try to reduce

1012
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,829
the amount of packaging that we're using

1013
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:34,309
or let's do something to make it easier

1014
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:36,049
for our employees to have a better work

1015
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:38,509
environment so these are very basic

1016
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:41,269
things that any any facility could do

1017
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,770
that would help improve and incorporate

1018
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:45,230
you know the most basic and permaculture

1019
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:47,599
principles into their into their

1020
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:49,460
cultivation yeah and one of the

1021
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,119
principles of permaculture is to start

1022
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,490
small we can't go from living in

1023
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,119
mainstream culture to completely

1024
00:42:55,489 --> 00:43:00,829
sustainable overnight it takes time and

1025
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:03,529
it really takes looking at the systems

1026
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:06,319
that you can change easily for the

1027
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:08,930
biggest impact and starting there

1028
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,940
instead of you know investing a lot in a

1029
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:13,639
big huge change that you you don't have

1030
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:16,130
experience with it's definitely good to

1031
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:17,750
just take baby steps on that on the

1032
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,340
other side of that if you haven't

1033
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,590
designed your property yet and you're

1034
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:25,250
starting from scratch this is a great

1035
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,620
tool for beginning that process to get

1036
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,929
you thinking about

1037
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:31,609
all your resources on that property and

1038
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:35,539
how you want to design the property to

1039
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:37,880
best maximize workflow and what is

1040
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:41,090
available based on where you're located

1041
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,160
so I I really encourage people one thing

1042
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:45,470
I find you know having a farm in a

1043
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:47,480
garden center is that people will walk

1044
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:48,439
in and buy one apple tree and then

1045
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,599
they'll plant it then they'll come back

1046
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,970
two weeks later and buy a walnut tree

1047
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,889
for example and then over the period of

1048
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:56,389
five years you go to their property and

1049
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:58,579
they have all these things haphazardly

1050
00:43:56,389 --> 00:44:00,379
scattered around the landscape and

1051
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,690
they're like this doesn't look like a

1052
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,990
landscape anymore whereas if they had

1053
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,429
invested you know a little more thought

1054
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:09,319
at the very beginning of the process

1055
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:10,639
they could have really designed

1056
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,050
something that made a lot more sense

1057
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,599
that they were happier with

1058
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:16,450
aesthetically putting in that time I

1059
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,579
think early on in your

1060
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:22,159
in your business or in your property is

1061
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:24,049
is huge yeah and that's really what

1062
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,929
permaculture is it's it's it's the

1063
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:29,150
process of design the steps you take to

1064
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:31,759
make those decisions the things that you

1065
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:34,070
look at and I essentially that's my job

1066
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,800
is to help people do that so of course

1067
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm a biased but all in favor of people

1068
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,269
taking the time and the money even if

1069
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,119
it's you know a 300 dollar consultation

1070
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:46,670
that could save you

1071
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,130
$100,000 in mistakes so it's it's well

1072
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:51,200
worth the time in gaining especially

1073
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,690
someone else's perspective who's been

1074
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,819
doing it a long time and that another

1075
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,920
thing about that like it whether it's

1076
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,440
cannabis or another crop or home

1077
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,320
gardening one of the best ways to learn

1078
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:06,139
is through someone who's already doing

1079
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,730
it in your bio region because the

1080
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,460
climate is going to be similar the goals

1081
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:11,719
are going to be similar and just having

1082
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,269
conversations with people who are

1083
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:17,980
already doing it is a great way to learn

1084
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:20,659
and avoid certain mistakes before

1085
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:22,699
beforehand yeah I do a little bit of

1086
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:24,529
consulting here and there and one of the

1087
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:26,179
things that people ask me is what cover

1088
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:28,190
crops should they be growing for example

1089
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:30,319
on their field through the winter and I

1090
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,579
always say go go talk to your

1091
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,530
neighboring farmers find out what

1092
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:36,199
they've already learned that works

1093
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:39,410
really well you know in your in your

1094
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,239
environment or in your region so there's

1095
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:43,699
a lot of resources out there getting to

1096
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:46,609
know your neighbors is is a big one for

1097
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,829
sure definitely what was anything else

1098
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,400
you wanted to cover regarding

1099
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,779
permaculture or do you want to talk a

1100
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,000
little bit more about what you're up to

1101
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:57,980
these days or it's up to you Ted I'm

1102
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,630
I'm happy to talk about whatever I think

1103
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,099
just just because you mentioned cover

1104
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,050
crops that's one more thing that can be

1105
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:05,809
added to

1106
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:07,280
outdoor cannabis growing is you know

1107
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:09,590
plants that add nitrogen back into the

1108
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,360
soil and I'm not sure if you've talked

1109
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:14,180
about that on other podcasts or not but

1110
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,840
I'm looking at legumes and nitrogen

1111
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:20,089
fixers as ground covers even is

1112
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,870
something that I would I would consider

1113
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:25,070
trying out yeah well let's uh we have

1114
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:26,900
talked a little bit about that but let's

1115
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,480
give the listeners a little a little

1116
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,070
background into what you have going on

1117
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:35,480
and what your next book is about before

1118
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:37,280
we sign off for the episode okay um well

1119
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,110
my next book so I've written

1120
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,430
the chicken free-range chicken gardens

1121
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,960
which was really about creating habitat

1122
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:44,989
for them in an ecological or

1123
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,780
permaculture way as they can be great

1124
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:49,789
allies to us and then the practical

1125
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,410
permaculture book was was really

1126
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:54,619
intended to be an introductory design

1127
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:58,460
manual and my latest book is called

1128
00:46:54,619 --> 00:47:00,730
creating sanctuary and that book was it

1129
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:05,570
took it to more of a personal level of

1130
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:08,360
well how can we create spaces for us to

1131
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:10,789
be rejuvenated to have our needs met and

1132
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,320
it kind of goes into the that second

1133
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:14,719
ethic I talked about of caring for

1134
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:18,559
people and starting with ourselves but

1135
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,809
looking at plants as allies and their

1136
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,690
sacred powers is what I think we ended

1137
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:25,549
up calling it in the book both from a

1138
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,460
historical perspective but also a

1139
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:31,039
medicinal and energetic standpoint so

1140
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:35,210
looking across the globe at how people

1141
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:38,989
have used plants throughout the ages as

1142
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:41,030
healers and it was a really fun but

1143
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:44,299
challenging book to write and I was

1144
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:45,830
really looking for those matches of you

1145
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,500
know the the plants that had ancient

1146
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:51,319
uses and the science behind those being

1147
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,530
validated now so that was really fun and

1148
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,110
it incorporates a lot of

1149
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:58,730
energetics and there's a chapter on

1150
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:00,950
creating sacred space for yourselves so

1151
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,920
it gets it gets into the spiritual realm

1152
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:06,529
of really taking care of yourself at a

1153
