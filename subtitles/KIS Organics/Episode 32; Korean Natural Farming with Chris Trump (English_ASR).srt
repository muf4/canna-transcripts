00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,570
the cutting edge of organic growing from

7
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,698
a science-based perspective and drawn

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,710
top experts from around the industry to

9

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,000
currently the largest natural farm in

15
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,218
America growing over 800 acres of

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,109
macadamia nuts they have returned sick

17
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,269
trees to vital health completely

18
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:09,030
eliminating three fungal diseases that

19
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,590
academic said was impossible now Chris

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,719
and I talked about the successes he's

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,640
had with Korean natural farming and the

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,459
philosophy behind it which you'll hear

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,099
both of us refer to periodically as KNF

24
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,048
we don't go too deeply into how many of

25
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,030
the nutrients are made as I don't think

26
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,790
audio is the best format for explaining

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,920
in detail how to make the IMO preps but

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,320
if you go to the podcast page on the

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,820
kiss organics website you can find links

30
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,368
to more information and videos from

31
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,669
Chris detailing exactly how this is done

32
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:40,799
I really enjoyed our conversation it was

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,019
great to hear about the amazing projects

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,618
Chris is working on right now I hope you

35
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,618

36
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,430
welcome to the show Chris I really

37
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,170
appreciate you coming on today I'm

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,780
excited to hear and learn all about

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,379
Korean natural farming and sort of your

40
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,640
role in that in that realm so maybe you

41
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,929
can start off telling me a little bit

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,879
about your personal history and how you

43
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:10,530
got into Canada yeah I'm glad to be you

44
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:12,969
thanks for the invite and I I grew up

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,890
for me

46
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:22,840
the place I was born in hula on the Big

47
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:29,379
Island of Hawaii was a farm we had goats

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:33,250
and cattle and milking cows and yeah

49
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:36,009
good stuff and growing up we tried my

50
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,979
dad found a bunch of different things

51
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:42,310
and some super successfully and some not

52
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:48,209
so successfully which is the life of a

53
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:51,550
farmer and I loved it I appreciated that

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,379
perspectives and kind of life growing up

55
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,830
I guess here I grow up a little bit in

56
00:02:53,379 --> 00:03:01,269
California Monterey California as well

57
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:04,360
as Hawaii so you know I grew up a roping

58
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:08,380
cattle and castrating with the pond Yolo

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,720
in Hawaii and then I go to I'm a city

60
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,719
life in California you know haven't

61
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,020
eaten cow testicles over the summer and

62
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:20,560
people are like just no perspective of

63
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,870
anything rural and country living so it

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,449
was it was a fun back and forth they

65
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,620
learned quickly that not to talk about

66
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:33,689
that castrating cattle in a city school

67
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:38,890
because people don't really get that but

68
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:41,289
we yep um and so my dad brought over

69
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:45,279
some of the first hair sheep to the Big

70
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:48,699
Island which is a type of sheep about a

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,709
ton of wool so it's real short hair

72
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,988
great for tropical environments because

73
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,379
the wool sheets get all kinds of skin

74
00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:00,219
diseases in the warm kind of humid

75
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,750
conditions of Hawaii so they brought

76
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:05,050
them over with the idea that they'd be a

77
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:08,349
little bit closer to Micronesia and some

78
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,840
of the other city balance because

79
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,810
there's pretty poor protein sources

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,310
there they have cattle but often not

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,089
refrigeration so family to butcher a cow

82
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,250
you know they don't they can't really

83
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,500
deal with it in the nest time for it and

84
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,939
all of us boil the sheep will be a

85
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,939
better option so we're still working on

86
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:30,079
that this

87
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:33,620
December I think we'll ship some sheep

88
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:37,399
for breeding to Cambodia as part of that

89
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,769
come a long term vision and help with a

90
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:44,060
small farm there that's trying to create

91
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:46,299
a feeding program so yeah we still have

92
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,100
about under sheep we had a thousand

93
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,650
about thirty years ago my dad started

94
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,410
farming macadamia nuts the situation

95
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:56,899
happened there was an existing orchard

96
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,270
and we got to move in start a permanent

97
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:02,000
you know home the land release the land

98
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:04,159
um so we used to run about a thousand

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,629
feet in the workers and then some of the

100
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,710
law has changed and yeah so we run about

101
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:17,629
200 sheep now but I still have the farm

102
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:21,459
so currently my family farms 800 acres

103
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:24,439
of organic macadamia nut all using

104
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:28,370
Korean natural farming and just

105
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:31,519
composting that's the exclusive kind of

106
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,370
nutrition program for the trees and it's

107
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,500
working really really well we're in a

108
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,129
better position as a farm kind of than

109
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,310
we've ever been and that's exciting in a

110
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:46,490
journey well I can't really a little bit

111
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,259
because my father had a nursery and

112
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,160
landscaping business growing up so I

113
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:54,199
grew up around plants myself and having

114
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,960
parents that were really into farming

115
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,060
and organics and growing plants in

116
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,859
general so I I understand that

117
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,550
connection between family business and

118
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,889
farms and that sort of thing and I feel

119
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,710
very fortunate to have have that growing

120
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,000
up myself and I got to see a little bit

121
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,709
of what you're talking about when I

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,220
visited the Big Island in terms of the

123
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:18,620
the horses and the Cowboys the the

124
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,030
paniolo I think it is with what they're

125
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,790
called is I think that's what you said

126
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:25,639
so really interesting history there too

127
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:28,850
now everyone says that you're the guy to

128
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,159
talk to when it comes to Korean natural

129
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,560
farming here in America I know there's

130
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,540
other people too but they are unwilling

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,680
to necessarily bridge the gap between

132
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:43,330
cannabis and in agriculture which I

133
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,620
can totally understand and respect but

134
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:47,120
people do talk about how much success

135
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,329
you've had and you're you yourself or

136
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,810
not a cannabis farmer is that correct no

137
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:56,689
I'm not so you've been growing the

138
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,100
macadamia nut trees and how did you how

139
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:59,779
did you find out about Korean natural

140
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,110
farming to even bring it onto your

141
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:07,489
property yeah that was a bit of a

142
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:10,189
journey and you know I can I am

143
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,590
definitely not a not a canvas farmer but

144
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:17,149
there has been times in my life where I

145
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:18,978
have been a cannabis farmer I wouldn't

146
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:21,649
quite call that a farmer I don't think

147
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:25,519
anything a high schooler does considered

148
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:28,969
farming for the most part by that yeah

149
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:32,060
for us in the trees that was a journey

150
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:36,050
and I grew up with a lot of really smart

151
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:40,280
people in my industry and the in order

152
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,439
crafts in Hawaii where kind of the

153
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:47,359
cultivation of macadamia that as a

154
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:50,329
commercial operation was begun there was

155
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,729
there's a lot of really informed and

156
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:55,250
knowledgeable people so I have to be

157
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:58,639
around them growing up which was a real

158
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:02,168
gift and hear recommendations retrieved

159
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,689
and the way things work

160
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:07,189
yeah method 18 that came from Australia

161
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:11,750
originally but they were just kind of a

162
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:16,490
wild I never really cultivated tree

163
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:19,098
there and Hawaii began connotes variety

164
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,050
trials and started that and then the

165
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:26,810
Australians to get back from Hawaiian

166
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:31,460
and began on their own so for us it was

167
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:35,450
a bit of a journey to recognize about 12

168
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:37,848
years ago maybe 13 that people that were

169
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,158
experts in our industry and macadamia

170
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,990
nuts might not be able to explain

171
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,620
everything that's went on in nature and

172
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,470
how Bastet under the trees we had an

173
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,078
event where we had a major crop failure

174
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,620
long story but the short of it is we had

175
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:55,870
to let our organic we were

176
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,620
operation at that time better left at

177
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:03,159
about 360 acres will fallow and during

178
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,049
that time they became far healthier than

179
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,149
they'd been with expensive amendments

180
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:12,338
and stuff we were doing kind of

181
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:15,360
traditional organic practices with some

182
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:19,930
purchased amendments and composting and

183
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,149
in three years of left being left alone

184
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:25,989
they were healthier than they had been

185
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:27,100
in a really long time and that we made

186
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,120
kind of a commitment

187
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,269
um I guess it was my job but made a

188
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,519
commitment to kind of not know anything

189
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,649
so we began to just kind of what what

190
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,539
did nature do what is nature doing and

191
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:46,149
how can we kind of do that in in the

192
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:48,278
future how can we partner with what just

193
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:51,519
happened we watched trees go from yellow

194
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:53,409
to green and from low in production to

195
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,789
higher in production well being

196
00:09:53,409 --> 00:10:03,189
completely ignored for three years and

197
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:04,929
that led us to explore different things

198
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:10,180
that were going on in the aquaponics

199
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:13,599
explosion and and then into Korean

200
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:16,719
natural farming there were people

201
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,320
bringing so none of the initiator this

202
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,740
was this guy dr. Park dr. Haines Park

203
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,260
he's a pediatrician turns like after 50

204
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,909
years of watching kind of disease

205
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:32,169
increase at the same time as medicine

206
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:36,129
got better who said there's something

207
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:40,329
wrong that must be our food and he went

208
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:42,850
to Korea s that in a 10-hour two-day

209
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,040
class you know to two days of ten hours

210
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:50,519
a day standing room only and a little

211
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:54,278
shed to listen to this guy Johan you and

212
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:59,049
who people called Master Joe which is

213
00:10:54,278 --> 00:11:01,120
just a term for teacher in Korea he came

214
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:04,059
back and excited he started just being

215
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,159
that share of that information I went to

216
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,000
one of the first classes he was teaching

217
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,490
about

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,570
and people are heckling tackling them

219
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:16,269
because it's a bit of a mind shift on

220
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,510
how we traditionally do things so one of

221
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:22,679
the things that really got some hassles

222
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:25,689
or whatever laughter from the crowd was

223
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:28,539
he talked about transplanting a tree and

224
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,340
I don't know if you threw your listeners

225
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:33,339
transplanting the tree traditionally

226
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:37,360
it's just really gentle and you you know

227
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:39,899
really try and alleviate any shock I you

228
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,639
know not not disturbing it too much and

229
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,769
stuffing your hole and there's there's

230
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,389
all kinds of good ways to do it but I'm

231
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,480
coming that you're farming you take it

232
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:55,000
you wash off all the potting soil or all

233
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:57,909
the dirt you trim the taproot and you

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,600
let it dry for a day or two depending on

235
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:05,230
the size of the tree and everybody just

236
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,240
slipped out and I'm scratching my head

237
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,700
because that is not how you transplant a

238
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:14,080
tree but then he's like and then we take

239
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,480
this nutrient you're soaked it and any

240
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,330
plants is Miss whole idea is helping us

241
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,180
to move out and that cedar root seeking

242
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:25,089
water he's given it this idea that it

243
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:30,129
needs to work on roots because there

244
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:31,990
could be a drought and so I was like

245
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:37,588
well I committed not to knowing anything

246
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:40,500
and just look like what is this and I

247
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:42,730
really works I've done that many times

248
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,019
that was ten years ago

249
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,240
a little more than ten years ago and it

250
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,129
works it's it's an incredible way to

251
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,310
change that trees and the trees do you

252
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:56,679
work on reproduction um before leaf

253
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,629
production in that scenario I make it

254
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,838
you know stronger if they if they

255
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:07,500
survive they're going to continue to

256
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:11,170
survive and it's this fun but then

257
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:14,259
Master Joe and his daughter came to my

258
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:16,929
tiny small town in Kahala so it was just

259
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,338
kind of a right place at a time when we

260
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,409
were already seeking these answers

261
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:24,279
because of what nature's that

262
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:25,958
on our farm and then I began a journey

263
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:29,620
of going to create a bunch of times to

264
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:33,189
study and when we started we were just

265
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,399
kinda skeptical as farmers tend to be so

266
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:40,029
we we just decided to do it really well

267
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,589
but had no real preconceived

268
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:45,009
expectations they're just gonna watch

269
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:46,350
what it did and we had results we had

270
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:50,889
really great results

271
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:53,139
we had a disease and mekka dating in

272
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:57,009
that industry called macademia quick

273
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:58,419
decline at ami a slow decline and it's a

274
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:02,230
reborn fungal disease called

275
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,938
Phytophthora and we had some effective

276
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,480
trees and the affected cheese and the

277
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:11,769
sporting cheese how we did and we

278
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:15,579
started applying IMO we had made some

279
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:18,129
biochar and gym spray and we've done it

280
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:20,769
right according to you know we've barely

281
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:22,720
been diligent with the process of

282
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,698
natural farming we didn't know it was

283
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,709
gonna fail it not but we didn't want it

284
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:30,758
to fail because we screwed it up one day

285
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:33,250
I'm gonna give it a good try and we have

286
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,350
these trees recover these disease trees

287
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,370
that in our industry push on that

288
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,470
three-year tube and they bounce back

289
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,578
within a year they re foliated these

290
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:47,319
streets that pulley defoliated and then

291
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:49,239
just kind of keel over and they'd be

292
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:51,370
foliated within a year and by here to

293
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,220
who they were back in production and by

294
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:58,240
year three they were like healthy

295
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,519
vibrant trees and um yeah there's

296
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,709
there's a whole lot more to that journey

297
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,328
of scaling up you know going from these

298
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:09,250
concepts that were being taught to us

299
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:11,849
and wheelbarrow kind of scale to 800

300
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,139
acres scale that was a serious journey

301
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,839
that was pretty much for me it was

302
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:18,549
pretty much by myself I did have a buddy

303
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,889
that come out and just be a real

304
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:23,378
encouragement and helped me understand

305
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:28,688
poncho NP Joey's

306
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:30,938
crazy horse tourists and and he was he

307
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:32,528
was he just made it fun you know they

308
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,789
have somebody to work because most of

309
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:34,328
the people on that farm was just like

310
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:37,360
what do we

311
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:41,289
doing your crazy I've got a mad

312
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:45,639
scientist but now we were fulfilled we

313
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:49,409
have a big ol operating lab our kind of

314
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:54,188
warehouse facility all geared around

315
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:58,169
just kind of efficiencies in the natural

316
00:15:54,188 --> 00:16:01,238
farming process yeah for our large farm

317
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:04,868
Wow so basically you had this you were

318
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:08,048
on this journey of trying to find the

319
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:09,699
right the right method for your farm and

320
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:11,919
try something new and so you just

321
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:13,808
started from scratch and decided you

322
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,238
were gonna give this a shot and you kept

323
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:18,188
having more and more success following

324
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:20,528
these these tech natural farming

325
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:24,009
techniques is that about I mean the jist

326
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:26,769
of it yeah yeah we didn't we didn't

327
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,989
start natural farming because they're

328
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:34,028
like oh this philosophy is what we have

329
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:36,069
to do we had 30 employees and their

330
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:38,769
priority on our farms they're kind of

331
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:42,308
the main reason in a kind of

332
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,269
economically success town and so we

333
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:46,178
weren't going to do something that

334
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:48,220
jeopardized and I was taking care of

335
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:50,198
what we had to do we had to be farmers

336
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,970
first so we weren't going to go out of

337
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:55,208
business for some Korean natural farming

338
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:58,269
philosophy we do Korean natural farming

339
00:16:55,208 --> 00:17:01,118
and we continued some kind of the step

340
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:04,019
by step trials and scaley not because it

341
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:10,269
worked and we just saw success at each

342
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:13,028
kind of scale step so that brings up a

343
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:16,269
question for me how do you feel Korean

344
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:17,949
natural farming compares to other you

345
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,919
know organic or natural farming

346
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:23,220
techniques that you see out there like

347
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,990
Fukuoka with one star revolution or

348
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,259
biodynamic you have your soil food web

349
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,970
people regenerative agriculture

350
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,379
probiotic farming you know there's all

351
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,399
these different groups that are all

352
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:39,639
slightly different but on a similar path

353
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:42,449
what separates in your eyes you know KNF

354
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:45,459
from from some of these other methods

355
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,319
yeah it

356
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,140
don't a lot of ways there's it's all

357
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:53,619
kind of the same thing right these work

358
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:56,320
or don't work because they work or don't

359
00:17:53,619 --> 00:18:00,219
work with how nature's designs or

360
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:04,210
function it's it's like gravity you know

361
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:09,160
most sports that you have all have these

362
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:11,519
similar kind of features go anywhere in

363
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,529
the world because they all play on

364
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:18,220
gravity affecting the ball falling back

365
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:23,829
down you know it's it's so a lot of

366
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,690
these things play into they use the

367
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:29,859
principles of nature and that's why they

368
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,539
work so there's not one method to tend

369
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,879
to the life of your soil there's been

370
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:37,720
methods all over the world throughout

371
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,400
the centuries that you know there were

372
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,460
scientific methods

373
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,610
no Sciences is the observational study

374
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,039
of nature and and they were scientific

375
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,839
and that they stopped doing what didn't

376
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:53,200
work and kept doing what work farmers

377
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,240
aren't stupid you know so after you know

378
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,590
several generations the things that

379
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,930
worked or the ones that were passed down

380
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:01,839
those were successful things for the

381
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:04,390
farmers so you have like Iceland they

382
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,639
take you know manures from the end of

383
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:09,340
the season stuff it in a hollowed-out

384
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,830
horn and bury it you know below where

385
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:13,659
the freeze goes and then next year they

386
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:16,779
dig it up and they spread it on their

387
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,090
field right when after the thaw and they

388
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:22,799
have a jump starts the microbial life in

389
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:25,779
their soil and the production of crops

390
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,119
well they didn't know what microbes were

391
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:32,289
but they knew that work somehow somebody

392
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:34,899
figured out that work and you know that

393
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:38,799
was a way to basically protect the

394
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,690
vibrant soil life from a freeze and get

395
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,730
it you know back up to speed a little

396
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:47,559
faster so that you could get a little

397
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:51,120
longer season for their crops so yeah so

398
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:54,819
short answer and the difference is

399
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,769
methodologies etc and what I like about

400
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:01,039
being natural farming is that

401
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:05,509
for for me it's an elegant method so as

402
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:10,009
I encountered all these inputs and ways

403
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:12,470
to do this I I kind of dug in and that's

404
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:14,750
why um that's kind of how my mind works

405
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,420
I need to kind of understand I need to

406
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,460
know especially as I scaled what things

407
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,519
can I mess with or what things are

408
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,410
shifting below and what aren't and I

409
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,629
know that I can't just change things

410
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,490
because I don't want to do it because if

411
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:31,570
I don't understand it I don't know what

412
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:35,630
I'm changing than what I'm losing and so

413
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:38,419
as I dug into the whys I found a lot of

414
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,630
solid science a lot of the things that

415
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,840
we were teasing that understanding and

416
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:47,500
you know um microbiological world were

417
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:51,709
principles of this was based on and and

418
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:56,960
so on you studied in Japan with enzymes

419
00:20:51,710 --> 00:21:01,039
and doctors and some of these natural

420
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:05,210
farming kind of leaders there and it's

421
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:08,509
it's based on good science so it's a way

422
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:11,630
that is scalable that is extremely

423
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:16,210
effective and works for commercial AG

424
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:18,890
and that some that's not true in in all

425
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:23,029
kind of natural farming principles and

426
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:25,520
practices and though they are all paired

427
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:28,940
with how nature works and some of them

428
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:34,279
are extremely difficult to scale or just

429
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:38,360
the efficiencies of farming kind of make

430
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:40,940
them untenable like permaculture for

431
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,779
example permaculturist wrath and based

432
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,840
on the principles of nature but if you

433
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:51,230
give me an 800 acre farm and my spinach

434
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,899
is sparse here and there over 800 acres

435
00:21:51,230 --> 00:22:01,700
when I have a spinach that's been

436
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:05,060
harvested Arvest spinach it's pretty

437
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,970
high just because of efficiencies you

438
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,779
know the inability to get it all in a

439
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:14,350
basket and get it to market

440
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:17,529
but if I have a small family or a few

441
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:19,719
families and I have a giant permaculture

442
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,129
food forest in my backyard then it's

443
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,549
great we can just go out and pick

444
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:26,860
whatever we want when we want to eat and

445
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:29,109
you know permaculture doesn't work for

446
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:31,899
us and it did wouldn't have worked for

447
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:33,699
us on our farm because of the jurassic

448
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:38,740
inefficiency that would have basically

449
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:41,680
been real dollars and cents issues see

450
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:44,200
see I would argue well first off I want

451
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,200
to say that I love your your philosophy

452
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,000
there I I'm in a similar boat in the

453
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,640
sense that I believe that all of these

454
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,009
groups including permaculture are all on

455
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,540
the same path and there's many ways to

456
00:22:54,009 --> 00:23:01,230
grow a plant and you know KNF being one

457
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:03,129
of them and i love the idea that we can

458
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,829
you know all go in the same direction

459
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,360
and maybe pull and use information from

460
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:10,299
all of these without throwing science

461
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,829
out the window and I to me that's an

462
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,379
important aspect of all of them and I

463
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:16,869
think that you know taking a scientific

464
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,420
approach to something like nature is is

465
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:23,559
very doable and they're not mutually

466
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,660
exclusive approaches or ideas and it's

467
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,429
in terms of permaculture just from my

468
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,940
own experience I would I would almost

469
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,860
want to say that that's a that's an

470
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,390
inefficient permaculture design because

471
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,459
really the way I see permaculture it's

472
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,290
just it's it's all about design it's all

473
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,269
about patterns and utilizing the

474
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:43,720
resources that you have in whatever

475
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:46,269
location or project that you're working

476
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,059
on so if if spinach harvest is part of

477
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:51,670
your revenue then you need to utilize a

478
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:53,289
design that will make it efficient for

479
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:57,670
you to harvest that spinach so that your

480
00:23:53,289 --> 00:24:02,379
overall processes can be you know can be

481
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:04,330
maximized so you know not not every

482
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,980
permaculture is a food for us because

483
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:09,129
food forests may not make sense

484
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:12,250
depending on what your overall goal for

485
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:15,100
that property is if that makes sense all

486
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,170
right so I love permaculture and I like

487
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:19,329
all the principles in it because I feel

488
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:22,779
like it's an observation of nature and

489
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:24,139
the new thing how nature works but why

490
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:27,379
does

491
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:33,680
trees and permaculture help the overall

492
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:37,220
production the the fruit trees the the

493
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:41,240
tree aspect of it the tall canopy plant

494
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,769
oh boy you know I'm not I guess strong

495
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,099
enough in permaculture to really be able

496
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:51,349
to answer yeah no no though it was

497
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:55,969
rhetorical outside okay yeah so the the

498
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:58,549
trees take this incredible strength they

499
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,620
have as they grow and they create

500
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:02,569
relationships soil food web site they

501
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:06,229
create relationships their root tips and

502
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:09,169
they they shuns that fungal Network in a

503
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,750
way that some of the lower plants don't

504
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:16,130
do as well they're just really good at

505
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:17,809
creating partnerships with fungus that

506
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,810
they're at the root tips and there's

507
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:23,359
such a big organism that all that

508
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:27,129
photosynthesis and energy and an

509
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:30,319
exchange really tends to the whole area

510
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,690
as a result the whole area is benefited

511
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,569
and so the the idea is getting the

512
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:39,190
taller tree and it's benefiting are

513
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:43,279
helping with the diversity in the soil

514
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:45,890
is is a great concept and it's true is a

515
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:49,069
true observation of nature and and the

516
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:53,300
partnering with how nature works but and

517
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:55,099
as a farmer if I think that diversity of

518
00:25:53,299 --> 00:26:00,409
microbial life and tend to that

519
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:03,799
microbial life by bringing in the

520
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,240
diversity of the florist and and it's

521
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,089
helping it get established in my

522
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,650
farmland and then just tending to it

523
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:13,399
being established just helping it stay

524
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:16,250
kind of vibrant in my soil then I can

525
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:19,820
get the benefit of the diversity of

526
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:24,259
microbial lives without needing a forest

527
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:27,529
in my farm to do so and that's where I

528
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:30,470
think permaculture has got it and yes as

529
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:33,730
a row crop farmer I can get that affect

530
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:37,400
by bringing in a indigenous microbial

531
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,849
highly diverse mix then unlike go that

532
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,580
route

533
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:42,230
other than canyon trees so you're trying

534
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:44,058
to imitate some of the benefits that you

535
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,798
would get from something some of these

536
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:48,970
permaculture designs are a food forest

537
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:51,558
but in more of a traditional

538
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,870
agricultural design that's more

539
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:55,548
efficient for harvesting this is

540
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:58,009
essentially what I'm efficient yeah

541
00:26:55,548 --> 00:27:00,710
efficiently so so the science is the

542
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,400
study of nature you don't partner with

543
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,120
nature

544
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,910
and do it scientifically science is just

545
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:10,729
learning from and and studying nature we

546
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:13,850
we've just deviated and think in science

547
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,740
and nature one because we've gotten off

548
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:18,589
into the you know production of

549
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,319
chemicals but you know or what not but

550
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:23,480
all those polymers and chemical they're

551
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,230
all based on principles we learn from

552
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,140
nature what nature's already doing and

553
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,779
you know it's it's fun so yeah all those

554
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:36,140
all those things you mentioned soil food

555
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:38,240
web bio dynamics they've all observed

556
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,330
something about nature and they're just

557
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,950
trying to emulate it so on that note I

558
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:45,470
guess I should have been more specific

559
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,509
in terms of saying scientific method

560
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,159
instead of just science in the sense

561
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:51,079
that we're controlling for a variable

562
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:52,179
and observing their results and I think

563
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:54,678
that's something that can be applied to

564
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:57,230
anything and that's something that I

565
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,850
really do believe in when it comes to

566
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,620
really understanding how something works

567
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:03,158
cuz my brains the same way like I want

568
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:06,829
to know more about the how and why

569
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:10,190
rather than just the process itself but

570
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:12,230
I guess my my problem I have and this is

571
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,529
not with KNF and this is not necessarily

572
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,230
with any of these sort of different

573
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:20,509
methods but some of the the fanaticism

574
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,599
that I see when people are you know say

575
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:25,069
that maybe KNF is the way that you need

576
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,579
to grow it's the only way or bio

577
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:31,700
dynamics or soil food web or you know

578
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:35,569
whatever type of methodology to the

579
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,860
exclusion of the other methods to me

580
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:38,990
that's I really struggle with like you

581
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:40,579
can almost feel cultish in some cases

582
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,130
and I haven't necessarily seen that with

583
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:45,558
KNF but I have seen it with some of

584
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:48,309
these other methodologies what's what's

585
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:50,750
your experience or thoughts on all that

586
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:51,410
yeah I see that

587
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,319
and

588
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:56,420
in natural farming they're creating

589
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,099
natural farming as well there's there's

590
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,130
people especially in the beginning and I

591
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:03,289
just as a farmer this same you know I

592
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,420
had this to say you know what I gotta

593
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:07,909
figure out if this works and if it works

594
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,430
and makes you know where we can be

595
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,940
productive farmers then there's a reason

596
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,330
for it

597
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,130
I'm I can't just pick it up as my

598
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:19,009
religion or something that's not that I

599
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,980
should work for us to be farmers you

600
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:24,559
know because I'm and it doesn't work for

601
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,829
for the world to change and have

602
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,629
increase in quality of foods either you

603
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:31,909
know the pitch to take go to a

604
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:34,940
conventional you know we farmer corn

605
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,100
farmers say hey I got this idea I think

606
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,900
it's really good for the world

607
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:41,659
you should go out of business little by

608
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,630
little over the next 10 years to to jive

609
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,890
with my philosophy that's a hard sell

610
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,350
they're like no thank you

611
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:51,860
we're gonna keep doing what we're doing

612
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:57,169
but if I say hey I make more money than

613
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:58,189
you and my crops better and I have more

614
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,590
time with my family

615
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,150
I think he should check out what I'm

616
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:07,309
doing and that's that's a much easier

617
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:11,000
spell and and it's true you know for us

618
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:13,129
on in the farm in Hawaii um you know

619
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,329
nurse our industry hasn't gotten into it

620
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,620
yet they don't really understand what

621
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:18,889
we're doing they like the look of our

622
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:20,689
trees and our crops but they don't

623
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,150
really know what we're up to

624
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:26,470
I'm gonna speak in China actually in

625
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:30,050
October if I can submit my PowerPoint

626
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:31,789
before they yell at me but um they're

627
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,309
the International mecha team that

628
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:36,259
symposium the southern China this year

629
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:37,669
and they asked me to speak about what

630
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,379
we've accomplished on a trees because

631
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,300
some of the leaders and the

632
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,370
international community came out and saw

633
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:47,720
our trees more like what it's going on

634
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:50,000
here but no it can't you can't mean just

635
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,710
a philosophy or farmers can't get behind

636
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,710
it and if this is the movement of

637
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:59,319
farmers and I think farmers have to be

638
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:02,569
able to get into it and so it has to

639
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:05,059
equate for a farmer to increase

640
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:09,529
production or

641
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:13,639
time or quality of product it has to or

642
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:16,639
it's like why and and then as far as

643
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,400
each individual group you know it's it's

644
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,230
what people know you know that they

645
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
can't get behind something they don't

646
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,860
know and if it's if it's their

647
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,380
livelihood that they're they're making

648
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:30,049
money from you know the selling of their

649
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,900
idea then you know they also don't want

650
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:37,129
you not and the other idea because that

651
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:40,640
might threaten or whatever so um when

652
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:42,620
somebody you know knows something and

653
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,340
they don't know something else then it's

654
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:48,439
just normal to you know say oh this is

655
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:51,619
good and I don't know about all that or

656
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,380
or to even be kind of antagonistic

657
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:56,689
towards something else because they just

658
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:01,070
don't understand it and that's I'm a

659
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:03,650
human condition so we're all kind of on

660
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:05,539
a similar path in terms of these natural

661
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:10,000
farming in these different methods and

662
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:12,379
as I would venture to say as you come to

663
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,869
oh no it's okay I was gonna say as you

664
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,700
come to understand the how and why

665
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:20,029
behind some of these practices which I

666
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,160
want to talk to you about next maybe you

667
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:25,039
can pick and choose the ones that are

668
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,410
best fitting for your environment so I

669
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,420
have some good cannabis friends that are

670
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,630
growers and excellent growers and they

671
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,160
use certain aspects of KNF in their

672
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,840
gardens and it works really well for

673
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,820
them they're not doing everything the

674
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,009
way a Korean natural farmer might do it

675
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:41,269
but they've definitely pulled aspects

676
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:43,720
because they've taken the time to learn

677
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:46,250
and understand what those particular

678
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:50,929
inputs and things will affect that

679
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:56,569
they'll have on their plants yeah

680
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:59,359
yeah it's and the thing is like there's

681
00:32:56,569 --> 00:33:02,689
some aspects to each one of these that

682
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:05,960
probably aren't super good for that

683
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:09,469
given a change could be better and

684
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,348
that's the part that's the part that you

685
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:16,219
know if if somebody and it just because

686
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:18,888
it's something they do or something they

687
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:22,099
like they know and that's where like

688
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:24,348
nothing I know I don't want to stay on a

689
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:27,168
ship that I know has a hole in it just

690
00:33:24,348 --> 00:33:31,028
because it's got my name on the side or

691
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:37,159
you know something like that so I I

692
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:40,098
think if we can be honest as we learn I

693
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:43,009
think that's the key so you know the

694
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:45,019
whole world's learning right now that

695
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:47,719
there's a whole lot more to the

696
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:51,200
interconnectivity of nature then we knew

697
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:53,058
as a scientific community and and that

698
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:59,088
there's a long journey ahead of us and

699
00:33:53,058 --> 00:34:02,868
as each group or you know camp learns oh

700
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:04,908
this actually isn't very good um if

701
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:07,128
we're honest about that and we can adapt

702
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:10,878
to move forward and I think it'll be

703
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:13,009
just uh it'll be a lot of fun to see

704
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:18,108
what kind of world our kids get to do

705
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:19,460
and play with and agriculture yeah I

706
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:22,460
mean at the end of the day we're all

707
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:25,519
promoting organic farming and healthier

708
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,710
ways to grow food locally and that's

709
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,298
better for the environment so and then

710
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,679
they were all on the same side I totally

711
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:32,628
agree with you on that

712
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,378
so just turning switching directions

713
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:38,358
here can we talk a little bit and and

714
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:40,068
maybe all maybe we'll get into this on

715
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:42,440
another podcast or something down the

716
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:45,500
road but can you give us just a general

717
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,470
idea of some of the inputs with KNF and

718
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:58,489
and sort of the philosophies specific to

719
00:34:48,469 --> 00:35:03,969
KNF yeah some of the philosophies are

720
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:03,969
like a similarity of plants to

721
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:13,909
humans you know in lifecycle in kind of

722
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:16,940
Edison flows of nutritional needs and so

723
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:20,480
one of the ways that that philosophy

724
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:25,068
plays in the practical kind of work for

725
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,219
a farmer is the idea that we need a

726
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:29,599
little bit of nutrients or the writer

727
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:35,000
chooses the right amount of nutrients at

728
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:37,730
the right time and so philosophy wise

729
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,909
where we're not a front-loading with all

730
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:45,048
the plans nutritional needs from day one

731
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:47,858
were we're tending to the kind of

732
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:51,980
changing needs of our plant based on its

733
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:54,159
growth cycle so you know and a lot of

734
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,960
cannabis farmers understand that concept

735
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:02,989
and in Korea natural farming it applies

736
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,349
to corn to trees lettuce all across the

737
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:06,679
board

738
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:11,150
you know the whole infancy and the low

739
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:13,308
nutritional needs and then vegetative

740
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:16,010
growth a change over a period where

741
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:18,650
there's kind of a morning sickness like

742
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,700
a human has and then reproductive growth

743
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,889
and and all the all the ways you observe

744
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:27,348
your plants and feed it accordingly

745
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:30,038
that's that's pretty central in the

746
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:36,099
feeding of in Korea natural farming and

747
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:40,250
the concept of using indigenous microbes

748
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:43,849
the balance and diversity that works or

749
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:45,920
has worked for kind of untended for

750
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:50,990
thousands of years in undisturbed forest

751
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:54,139
or kind of land in the surrounding area

752
00:36:50,989 --> 00:37:00,019
is what we'll self-perpetuate on the

753
00:36:54,139 --> 00:37:04,038
farm so that that idea of getting the

754
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:08,838
thriving kind of soil food web or

755
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:11,599
microbial life from your area and

756
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:16,009
applying it in your area it's a central

757
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,500
idea and so yeah this kind of the

758
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:22,050
microbial input which is

759
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:24,809
microorganism and that that process is

760
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:28,560
pretty entailed and then there's the

761
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:30,059
kind of nutritional and feed aspect of

762
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,539
Korean natural farming which is a

763
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:37,860
variety of inputs that are able to be

764
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:41,789
soiled rinsed in or taken into foliar

765
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,079
feeding so I don't want to get into all

766
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:46,320
the inputs because I know it's a rather

767
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,449
complex subject and there's a lot that

768
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,590
goes into it and if someone really wants

769
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:51,480
to learn they're going to have to do

770
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,269
more research than they can pick up in

771
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,490
you know listening to it to a podcast

772
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:58,650
for an hour but I want to give them a

773
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,029
taste of sort of the philosophies of it

774
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,610
which I think you did so essentially

775
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:05,300
what we're talking about here is is

776
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:07,849
locally sourced nutrient inputs and

777
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:11,280
essentially locally sourced

778
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:15,589
microorganisms as sort of the two main

779
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,710
drivers for KNF is that is that accurate

780
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:23,610
yeah and it's also inexpensive the idea

781
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:26,670
is that you can use you can use things

782
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:35,880
that you might otherwise think of as

783
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:39,030
waste or kind of low value become pretty

784
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,240
valuable or usable and the natural

785
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:46,080
farming form and so like on our farm we

786
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:49,139
weave everything all of our byproducts

787
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,119
now are really cared for and because we

788
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:56,969
didn't do so much with them they become

789
00:38:51,119 --> 00:39:00,239
so musical and yes or our farm has

790
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:03,179
become kind of a real recycler of local

791
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,729
inputs and user and and that's I mean

792
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:09,329
when we're on an island if it's not

793
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:12,599
shaking things in can can really equates

794
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:13,949
dollars and cents as well oh yeah I mean

795
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,630
that makes a ton of sense because we're

796
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:20,609
reducing our environmental impact with

797
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:23,160
fossil fuels and getting material out to

798
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:25,710
you you're gonna save a ton of money and

799
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,690
I totally get that so can you give me an

800
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,909
example let's say someone on the

801
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,619
mainland might use of a waste product

802
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:34,769
nutrient source that can

803
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:44,190
is recycling back into a beneficial

804
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:48,110
input on their soil sure so all be yeah

805
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:50,760
let's see so fermented plant juice is a

806
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,870
input in Korean natural farming that's

807
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,800
the plant food

808
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:57,659
it's a ferment and some of the

809
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,580
misconceptions I've seen online that we

810
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:02,519
have to get it like store-bought you

811
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:04,949
know nice for you to make amended

812
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:08,190
statutes and that's actually really

813
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:12,089
Korean natural farming philosophy is

814
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:17,240
just something that got a little changed

815
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:22,710
online but you can go out and get a wee

816
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:27,149
quite literally local invasive or a

817
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:29,480
local just grows everywhere but never

818
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:33,269
touch it it's always healthy and green

819
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:36,059
and that can become a real food source

820
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:38,369
not a theoretical food source but just

821
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:40,440
like people buy kelp you know they get

822
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,739
kelp and they use kelp and they're like

823
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,519
wow I get great results with kelp and

824
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:50,339
the beneficial bio chemicals in any

825
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,809
surviving plant and for whatever reason

826
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,850
the plant that's thriving the weed

827
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:56,309
that's thriving in your zone is able to

828
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:59,219
take up nutrients extremely well great

829
00:40:56,309 --> 00:41:00,449
to thrive there when nobody farms it

830
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:03,719
it's just the thing that grows

831
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:05,819
everywhere and it's always healthy it is

832
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:11,250
taking up nutrients well and it's going

833
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:14,460
to be filled with the kind of the plant

834
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:18,090
growth hormone and other beneficial bio

835
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:21,300
chemicals that plant actually benefits

836
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:23,070
um it's not it's not pretend it's it's

837
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,890
kind of in the world of cutting that

838
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:27,690
research that a lot of your your plant

839
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:30,960
companies are looking at now they know

840
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:33,090
that plants have these bio chemicals

841
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,769
that can help other plants grow they

842
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,120
don't know exactly how it works yet and

843
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:37,349
they're trying to isolate them and

844
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,259
figure out how each one works

845
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:45,299
individually but you can just take this

846
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:49,920
concept of using the new growing tips

847
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:53,700
the thriving fresh plant and for making

848
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,090
it and getting out that nutrient and

849
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:59,849
then applying it to your plan so all of

850
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:04,769
a sudden you're Iceland or your IV or

851
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:08,360
your rhubarb or 100 other kind of weed

852
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:12,239
type things in your area become a

853
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:14,730
resource that actually has equates to

854
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:19,259
production on your farm and that's

855
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:22,740
that's pretty cool so you're taking like

856
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:25,260
a healthy biomass from whatever plants

857
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:28,649
are thriving in your local region and

858
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:35,130
then fermenting it and making it into a

859
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:38,309
liquid nutrient essentially yeah now my

860
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,140
initial thought on that is many weeds

861
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:43,980
just do tissue testing and things are

862
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:45,690
quite low in macronutrients right

863
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,820
definitely but you're getting a lot of

864
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,980
trace elements like you mentioned kelp

865
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,200
and kelps wonderful for the reasons that

866
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,900
you do get you know 70 different trace

867
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,699
elements you get plant growth hormones

868
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,880
and regulators and as a ton of benefits

869
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:01,649
it's been widely studied but not

870
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,650
terribly high in NPK there's a little

871
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,420
bit in there but are you thinking that

872
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:10,700
the main benefit from these things then

873
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:14,159
would be would be trace elements or you

874
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:15,839
know mineral nutrients that are a little

875
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,210
bit a little bit smaller and maybe

876
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,640
lacking in the soil or lacking in the

877
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:27,570
plant's ability to take them up so I

878
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:31,440
have all kinds of theories and I can tie

879
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:35,820
it to a lot of current research in this

880
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,710
kind of realm of how these you know

881
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,260
they're taking these plants from the

882
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:42,740
desert that grow like crazy they're

883
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,630
extracting the specific phytochemicals

884
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:47,309
combining with other similar properties

885
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:48,780
and other plants and then applying it to

886
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:52,259
plants and getting these incredible

887
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,540
results and exactly what's going on

888
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,290
there and by Stan's respond like that to

889
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:58,949
these things I don't understand

890
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:00,690
personally

891
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:03,599
and I think a lot of the people

892
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:08,010
researching them understand aspects but

893
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:10,799
how they work together how that you know

894
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:14,730
might help a plant with its root zone or

895
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:18,570
its interconnectivity with the soil food

896
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:20,250
web or any number of things its uptake

897
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,930
of nutrients its ability for the

898
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:25,559
microbes and its roots and uptake

899
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:27,649
nutrients or transfer nutrients do that

900
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:31,769
a lot of questions that were all as a

901
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:37,050
community of researchers asking right

902
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:43,110
now I'm trying to learn so what I like

903
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:45,510
and claim in nature is that I've held on

904
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:49,170
to that and there's actually a core

905
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:51,360
natural farming principle but we started

906
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,800
it before we mean natural farming that

907
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,660
held on to that thing that happened on

908
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,000
our farm where I was like okay I'm gonna

909
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:59,190
I'm gonna know nothing I've had a

910
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,349
lifetime growing enough of experts in my

911
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,909
field I'm gonna check that knowledge at

912
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:05,339
the door not that I throw it away

913
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:08,159
because farming knowledge is awesome and

914
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,370
it and it all interacts with and applies

915
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:15,299
in using green and natural farming but

916
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:20,150
I'm gonna say it's okay to not know and

917
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:23,550
learn something and so empty mind is a

918
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:25,680
core kind of philosophy in natural

919
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:28,050
farming that's very an evasion thought

920
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:31,500
by them it's helpful because it's like

921
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:33,060
hey imagine for a moment they don't know

922
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,699
everything about what you're talking

923
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:39,090
about or what you form imagine for a

924
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:41,789
moment that that's true and what might

925
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:44,070
you learn or what might you be up for

926
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:53,190
trying to see how it works or succeed

927
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:56,700
and so exactly why a new growing tips of

928
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:59,490
a vibrant plant in your area equates you

929
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:03,449
a real response in a plant and when

930
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:05,399
combined with the vinegar and oriental

931
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:09,989
Oracle nutrient which is something we

932
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,298
make you know and vinegar micronized or

933
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:14,988
helps

934
00:46:11,298 --> 00:46:17,898
water powder particles and uptake you

935
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:22,369
know why all of this you know why plants

936
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:24,768
responded like this I'm not sure I have

937
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:27,259
again they have ideas and things I've

938
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:29,538
read it's like oh wow that's part of it

939
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:31,219
and we're learning about that but a lot

940
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:33,919
of this is research that we did we're

941
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:35,838
going to get wash get to watch and come

942
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:38,418
to fruition over the next ten to ten

943
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:42,438
years where we actually understand how

944
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:43,998
this all works yeah I totally agree with

945
00:46:42,438 --> 00:46:45,678
you on that like there's no so much we

946
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:48,048
don't know about the soil and about how

947
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,929
plants utilize nutrients in the soil

948
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:52,668
that we're still learning so it's

949
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:55,338
entirely possible and I think it's okay

950
00:46:52,668 --> 00:46:58,429
not to know why at the same time I don't

951
00:46:55,338 --> 00:47:01,009
I don't think we need to be afraid to

952
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:02,898
say we don't know or to say or they

953
00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:04,849
still want to do something as long as

954
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:06,798
we're being open-minded like you said to

955
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:08,749
learning more and if if we learn down

956
00:47:06,798 --> 00:47:12,168
though down the way that maybe it wasn't

957
00:47:08,748 --> 00:47:13,968
the and and this may not be the best

958
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:15,408
example but maybe maybe you were getting

959
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:17,179
the results because of the vinegar or

960
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:19,219
because of the particular water or one

961
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:22,329
of the other inputs sure then you can

962
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:24,798
adapt in and pour the sugar sure yeah

963
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:27,369
which I doubt and this is the best

964
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:29,449
example of that but I think that sort of

965
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:32,059
philosophy of always wanting to learn

966
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:34,249
and applying scientific method to what

967
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:36,649
you're trying so you can really find out

968
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:39,518
what's making a difference in that

969
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:43,909
plants health it's really important

970
00:47:39,518 --> 00:47:45,588
totally that's I think yeah I think what

971
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:47,989
you just said the scientific method like

972
00:47:45,588 --> 00:47:49,458
everybody's like oh well I think this is

973
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:51,829
a good idea if I just throw all this

974
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:53,478
stuff and I'm not gonna put it on I like

975
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:56,089
my plants are super healthy this year

976
00:47:53,478 --> 00:47:57,708
and it's like well would they have been

977
00:47:56,088 --> 00:48:00,918
healthy this year if you didn't do that

978
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:05,478
like I love the idea of side by side

979
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:07,068
child and and the control and yeah we we

980
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:09,858
played with a lot of that over the years

981
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:11,838
on the farm because I didn't understand

982
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:16,848
what I could change and what was helpful

983
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:19,489
and I am Elena him actually and I'm

984
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:21,139
coming to again my tiny town and in

985
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:23,329
Hawaii and teaching us to use the

986
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:24,440
microscope and and make qualitative

987
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:29,359
assessment

988
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,740
was was a huge key for me to kind of in

989
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,009
this journey in natural farming to be

990
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:36,799
able to change things based on what kind

991
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,119
of microbial growth and life and

992
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,400
diversity I was seen under the

993
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,619
microscope that was that was a big deal

994
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,210
and that was actually came and again

995
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:46,849
coming just the right time when I was

996
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:49,519
asking those questions I want to talk

997
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:51,260
about that so there's two things that I

998
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,139
really want to talk about with you the

999
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,250
first one would be indigenous

1000
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:58,639
microorganisms since this is such a key

1001
00:48:55,250 --> 00:49:01,909
aspect of Canada the idea of sourcing

1002
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,710
and using local microorganisms so I gave

1003
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:06,739
you the example when we were talking

1004
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,269
earlier offline about how Steve Solomon

1005
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:10,279
stalks him he's a he's a mineral

1006
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:12,039
nutrient guy so he's he's not as big on

1007
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,769
salah balaji but he's really big about

1008
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:20,329
remineralization of soils so assuming

1009
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:21,679
but-- Steve Solomon oh yeah he he wrote

1010
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:22,700
a book called the intelligent gardener

1011
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,799
which is a really good book on

1012
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:26,318
mineralization and understanding soil

1013
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,769
testing for people that are looking to

1014
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:32,809
get into that but one thing he talks

1015
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:35,420
about that I that really resonated me

1016
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:38,000
with me was the idea that you know he

1017
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:42,858
was farming on land that was exceedingly

1018
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,449
low in calcium and so his crops were

1019
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:47,119
suffering and they were low in calcium

1020
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:48,919
as well and he didn't know this at the

1021
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,280
time but he'd you know he's calm he's

1022
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,108
composting those crops and he's eating

1023
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,210
those crops primarily and his health is

1024
00:49:54,108 --> 00:49:58,190
starting to go downhill and when he was

1025
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,630
finding was when he took that compost

1026
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:01,690
that he was making and then applied it

1027
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,780
back to the land he was really just

1028
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:08,568
compounding his problem because if his

1029
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:11,240
if what was limiting the the biggest

1030
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:13,789
limiting factor to growth in his soil

1031
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:15,439
was calcium and he was putting applying

1032
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:18,170
compost that was low in calcium

1033
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,720
he was just compounding a problem so I

1034
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:23,420
would apply this to indigenous micro

1035
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,129
organisms so if your soil if you're

1036
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,338
using indigenous micro organisms in the

1037
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:30,980
soil that is say deficient or depleted

1038
00:50:28,338 --> 00:50:33,500
or has the wrong ratio of microorganisms

1039
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:36,289
wouldn't bringing in an outside source

1040
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,909
add diversity that would either die off

1041
00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:38,210
and become food sources for your in

1042
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,879
digit

1043
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:45,079
microbes or possibly survive and fill a

1044
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:49,640
niche that was previously on occupied by

1045
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:52,489
the best beneficial microorganisms yeah

1046
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:55,849
I think I think the the question that

1047
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:58,369
you're asking is Anna two parts you're

1048
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:02,110
talking about minerals Solomons example

1049
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:06,739
which is a great a great question and

1050
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:11,360
really interesting one and how nature

1051
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:13,569
works in balance on a mineral level we

1052
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:17,930
see it in seawater the incredible

1053
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:21,070
diversity of mineral seawater and how it

1054
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:26,199
stays and some sort of balance and

1055
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:32,180
actually have an example of a a guy in

1056
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:35,210
Waimea how come well in on the big

1057
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:38,539
island and you said wow farms he's a

1058
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:43,670
tomato farm and great tomato fun and he

1059
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:46,250
teaches a lot of Hawaiian people to to

1060
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:49,070
farm like he does on their land and just

1061
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:54,829
a cool cool family then just killing

1062
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:56,890
that in production of tomatoes and he he

1063
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:59,420
didn't agree natural farming he does

1064
00:51:56,889 --> 00:52:00,199
organic farming and front loads and

1065
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,720
minerals

1066
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:06,679
he lets across he lives with tomatoes

1067
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,759
grow one full crop and then he replaces

1068
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:13,480
them with fresh start

1069
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:17,270
he's just he has it style but he had a

1070
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:23,119
he was so firm it was it was atmospheric

1071
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:28,659
mineral um that just was destroying his

1072
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:34,639
crop and he he doesn't have this extreme

1073
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:38,379
like college background in agriculture

1074
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:40,730
he studied other things and so he just

1075
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:44,420
intuitively I need to balance the

1076
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:48,050
minerals and so he loaded up all this

1077
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:50,510
other huge kind of overloaded the plants

1078
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,589
way more than he would normally do to

1079
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,170
balance this at

1080
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:59,328
newest ulcer that came in through the

1081
00:52:54,170 --> 00:53:02,059
rain because of our volcanic ash and he

1082
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:04,339
he loaded up on the other minerals that

1083
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:08,690
balanced or worked in conjunction with

1084
00:53:04,338 --> 00:53:11,328
and he had just the most beautiful crop

1085
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:13,759
and it went all these plants recovered

1086
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:15,680
and went gangbusters and these these

1087
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:18,858
guys from the university system are like

1088
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:21,739
well why did you do that why did you add

1089
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:24,228
in all these other minerals like those

1090
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:25,519
those are way too much minerals or this

1091
00:53:24,228 --> 00:53:28,218
and that and he's like well I just

1092
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:30,439
seemed right to balance it that's why

1093
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:34,639
they were something somebody imbalance

1094
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,409
this this one imbalance that came in you

1095
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:39,409
know he doesn't he's not apologizing for

1096
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:40,308
not understanding exactly why is he's

1097
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:42,998
just saying it worked

1098
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:46,099
and there would need to be a lot more

1099
00:53:42,998 --> 00:53:49,659
study to say that's empirical evidence

1100
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:53,588
of this or that but um it just them I

1101
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:56,808
see that in nature we nature wants um

1102
00:53:53,588 --> 00:53:59,778
balance or for a lot of the crops that

1103
00:53:56,809 --> 00:54:01,729
we would grow or a little you know some

1104
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:06,559
crops like a little imbalance one way or

1105
00:54:01,728 --> 00:54:10,419
another pH um but I'm yeah so I could

1106
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,739
totally see deep you Solomon canna

1107
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:17,450
playing with those things and seeing the

1108
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:19,519
results and taking an imbalance crop and

1109
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:23,598
keep applying it you perpetuate the

1110
00:54:19,518 --> 00:54:26,689
imbalance and with soil microbes though

1111
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:29,088
I think it is actually an entirely

1112
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:32,150
different question that's being asked

1113
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:35,328
though I recognize that those kind of

1114
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:41,239
connect for you I don't believe they are

1115
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:43,548
quite the same in it is totally possible

1116
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:46,460
that you could buy some last round

1117
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:48,469
microbe and add it to what's going on

1118
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,489
and then it finds some niche and stays

1119
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:54,858
established and that's totally possible

1120
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:57,769
generally what we see with microbe grown

1121
00:54:54,858 --> 00:55:02,139
you know like Okinawa is microbial life

1122
00:54:57,768 --> 00:55:04,939
brought in to grow crop is but it has

1123
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:05,269
incredible results first of all so

1124
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,980
there's no

1125
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:10,550
nothing wrong with buying bugs in the

1126
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:12,710
jug and a soil microbial life from

1127
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:14,990
someplace that makes it but it tends to

1128
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:17,409
have about a six months fall-off now an

1129
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:20,719
indoor grow I think there's a lot to

1130
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:26,599
study in that and how how that all might

1131
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:28,039
work but you know the the generally

1132
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,099
speaking outdoors you're going to have

1133
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:33,769
this kind of complete dissipation over

1134
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:35,269
six months though it totally helps

1135
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:38,449
plants grow food and all you need to do

1136
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:42,980
is reapply it to kind of get it up again

1137
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:46,009
and feed it and etc but the idea of

1138
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:50,269
using indigenous microbial life so say I

1139
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:54,440
go and I got cropland and it was killed

1140
00:55:50,269 --> 00:55:56,809
or farmed with pretty noxious chemicals

1141
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,840
from a different farming method and I

1142
00:55:56,809 --> 00:56:02,119
had come in to farm it and I want to

1143
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:03,890
tend to life the soil well you know

1144
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:10,579
bacteria can come in on the wind and

1145
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:13,969
yeast can fungi doesn't easily and so I

1146
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:17,090
might have a very very small range of

1147
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:20,480
microbial diversity on that land even

1148
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:22,340
though the surrounding area might be

1149
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,670
rich or untouched

1150
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:28,460
I had a soil scientist out where we

1151
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:31,849
farmed in Hawaii and he was studying the

1152
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:35,360
difference of a hundred feet away from

1153
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:38,029
each other when downhill a hundred feet

1154
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,620
or you know from this fence line he had

1155
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:41,570
this fence line that's the divider on

1156
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:43,849
one side of the defense line and had

1157
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:46,519
been farmed in sugar cane which is a

1158
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:49,819
pretty intensive and not always very

1159
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:52,159
holistic farming practice done in

1160
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,110
islands and on the other side it had

1161
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,449
never been in crop production

1162
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,579
there had been cattle on it but had

1163
00:56:56,449 --> 00:57:01,849
never been kind of the land with that

1164
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:06,500
and the amount of soil microbial

1165
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:09,199
diversity or the soil life was um he I

1166
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:13,550
forget the exact numbers but it was it

1167
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:15,199
was major like ten ten to one as far as

1168
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:18,920
different microbes and we're talking

1169
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,808
literally 100 feet and the same

1170
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,048
and the same rainfall barometric

1171
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:26,390
pressure everything just on the other

1172
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:30,259
side of the fence and so as much as

1173
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:33,828
there has been rain and and animals

1174
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:35,930
traveling a lot of that microbial life

1175
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:39,980
didn't bounce back it didn't just come

1176
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:44,149
from that uphill spot and move in back

1177
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:46,608
into this area so the idea of

1178
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:49,130
transferring indigenous microbes is is

1179
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:53,808
something where we're just helping to

1180
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:58,880
take soil food web or the the microbial

1181
00:57:53,809 --> 00:58:00,530
thriving life of fertile zone and bring

1182
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,510
it in and we don't just pick one spot

1183
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:04,880
and natural farming or trying to get it

1184
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:07,160
from ten different spots in the local

1185
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,588
area where it's kind of untouched

1186
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:11,899
microbial diversity and we're hoping for

1187
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:13,489
exactly that we're hoping that some of

1188
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,160
them might be the exact same thing that

1189
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:18,048
already exists on my land but some of it

1190
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,848
might be something that actually needs a

1191
00:58:18,048 --> 00:58:21,739
little assistance to move back in

1192
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:26,950
because it doesn't just blow in on the

1193
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:29,598
land and so we bring in some soil from

1194
00:58:26,949 --> 00:58:33,889
our farm and hopefully some from just

1195
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:36,410
outside or and then we bring in we try

1196
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:40,219
and cultivate and collect indigenous

1197
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:42,889
microbial inoculant from the local area

1198
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:46,039
again hoping that it does kind of sell

1199
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:48,368
in and and that doesn't mean that

1200
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:50,989
there's not another way to get some

1201
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:53,420
increased microbial diversity or that

1202
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:55,149
some things that somebody grows in our

1203
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:59,318
lab wouldn't establish in some places

1204
00:58:55,150 --> 00:59:03,318
but there's very slight differences in

1205
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:05,420
varieties of microbes and what's those

1206
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:08,329
differences equates you and how they

1207
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:10,670
interconnect with our other microbes we

1208
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:12,920
don't really understand all that sure

1209
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:15,588
there's so much we don't know about this

1210
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,809
all food web and nutrient cycling in

1211
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:19,130
plants and the rhizosphere that we love

1212
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:21,410
to learn so I totally agree with that

1213
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:23,750
and I guess in terms of indigenous

1214
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:26,358
microorganisms versus outside sources my

1215
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:31,829
thought was not so much

1216
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:34,380
man man-made or man propagated microbial

1217
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:36,298
sources but rather compost teas or

1218
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,568
extracts or things like that because

1219
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:41,730
they've done research that shows that so

1220
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:44,460
microbes are relatively ubiquitous in

1221
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:46,318
that ninety-nine point whatever percent

1222
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,269
of them are found worldwide but in

1223
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:51,000
different diversity and ratios and

1224
00:59:48,269 --> 00:59:54,778
things like that that's why this

1225
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,670
slightly different to make up yes so the

1226
00:59:54,778 --> 00:59:58,559
idea that you know you're sourcing from

1227
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:00,389
different areas around say an island

1228
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,519
like that mm-hmm

1229
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:05,250
I I think that makes a lot of sense I

1230
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:07,230
guess it's all how you define indigenous

1231
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:09,389
if you're talking about just within your

1232
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,980
property then I wonder if that that is

1233
01:00:09,389 --> 01:00:14,420
enough diversity or not and I guess it's

1234
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:17,130
not really a question we can answer but

1235
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:19,318
no yeah I'm natural farming you don't

1236
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:21,778
just go within the property you gotta go

1237
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:24,750
you know 500 feet up in elevation as

1238
01:00:21,778 --> 01:00:26,909
possible and definitely to places as

1239
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:30,150
little disturbed for as many thousand

1240
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:32,608
years as possible but I have heard that

1241
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:36,088
that argument before or that comment

1242
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:37,639
regarding these you know let's let's

1243
01:00:36,088 --> 01:00:39,778
just say bugs and jugger outside

1244
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:44,400
microbial sources when they're added in

1245
01:00:39,778 --> 01:00:48,199
as not persisting in new in new areas

1246
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,880
and I I guess that's something that I've

1247
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:52,439
never seen really good data on and I

1248
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,230
don't really understand it now if you

1249
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,750
were to say that you apply a particular

1250
01:00:55,230 --> 01:01:00,420
microbe species like a lactobacillus for

1251
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:02,099
example and it persists for the life of

1252
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,139
that crop and then when that crop dies

1253
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:05,640
and something else comes in this soil

1254
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:07,769
then it disappears and you have to

1255
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:09,629
reapply it I could totally get behind

1256
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:11,489
that but the idea that it would last for

1257
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:13,170
around six months and then suddenly have

1258
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:15,959
a die-off without any environmental

1259
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:18,119
change I just don't understand why that

1260
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,179
would occur because it would have I mean

1261
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:22,890
if it's lasting for six months that's

1262
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:24,568
successive generations of any bacterial

1263
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:27,028
colony you know at that point or species

1264
01:01:24,568 --> 01:01:31,949
being relatively healthy and surviving

1265
01:01:27,028 --> 01:01:34,619
and reproducing right yeah yeah and and

1266
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:37,500
I think I think you've touched on

1267
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:39,030
something that is probably wrong in my

1268
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:43,320
language six months

1269
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:47,940
is far too much of a generalization for

1270
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:53,700
any you know real science talk and as so

1271
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:55,860
III I just want to place a delicate but

1272
01:01:53,699 --> 01:01:58,199
on the term six months because I think

1273
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:01,170
you're right I think exactly which

1274
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:03,539
microbe and which bugs in the jug and

1275
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:07,139
how it persists in which environment

1276
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:08,849
those are all going to be completely you

1277
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:13,079
know needing to be looked at

1278
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:14,130
individually and you know I can't I

1279
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:15,809
can't make it I've heard this

1280
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:19,110
generalization not just for me but from

1281
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:23,579
other other people mostly soil food web

1282
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:25,829
people and I'm really just asking the

1283
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:27,509
question I'm not trying to pass judgment

1284
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:31,230
one way or another on it this was just

1285
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:33,240
my initial thought regarding it the idea

1286
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:36,210
that if something is going to persist it

1287
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:38,579
either well persist or won't persist it

1288
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:40,740
and if it's not persisting it's it's

1289
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:42,480
only gonna last you know a matter of a

1290
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:44,009
day or two and beam I thought before it

1291
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,500
either ran out of food sources or got

1292
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,030
eaten by another microbe in the soil

1293
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,590
because we're primarily adding bacteria

1294
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:54,900
if that's what we're talking about so I

1295
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:57,450
yeah and and so I I don't I don't have a

1296
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,670
total understanding in this but as far

1297
01:02:57,449 --> 01:03:01,679
as it's just to try and help wrap around

1298
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:04,200
some of the kind of possible

1299
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:08,549
environmental changes that can occur on

1300
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:13,319
a microbial level the so say it say

1301
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:16,620
something comes in and if maybe your

1302
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:19,140
your land is needing some conditioning

1303
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:20,519
it's a little hard or there's not a lot

1304
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:22,859
of thriving life and you bring in

1305
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:28,259
something like a like a lactobacillus

1306
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:31,349
string something in that that family and

1307
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:33,270
they break up the soil and you're

1308
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:35,250
feeding them in conjunction with that

1309
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:40,679
and watering it kind of putting in this

1310
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:44,070
crop then some of the things that were

1311
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:45,719
there but maybe weren't thriving get up

1312
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,500
to speed to because now your soil is

1313
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:52,739
more aerated earthworms it comes and

1314
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:57,250
stuffs getting better or or whatnot

1315
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:58,318
the indigenous guys tend to beat out for

1316
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,210
territory

1317
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:03,489
things that maybe don't it isn't their

1318
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:06,909
favorite zone maybe not temperature

1319
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:11,259
maybe whatever it is rainfall moisture

1320
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:17,739
dry next and so my understanding is that

1321
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:21,160
there's a losing out to the locals that

1322
01:04:17,739 --> 01:04:24,459
that happened in in kind of just

1323
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:27,868
competing for space in the in the soil

1324
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:30,909
column so that's kind of how I

1325
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:33,640
understood it yeah I mean it's not

1326
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:36,909
something we can necessarily settle

1327
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:38,139
today it's there's so much like he said

1328
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:39,399
there's so much we don't know I just

1329
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:40,358
wanted to have a discussion about it

1330
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,210
because I think it's an interesting

1331
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:46,119
topic and I've heard these things said

1332
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:48,789
and I just was curious to hear another

1333
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:51,700
another idea on it one other thing that

1334
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:54,910
I'm curious to get your opinion on is I

1335
01:04:51,699 --> 01:05:00,730
hear especially from from soil food web

1336
01:04:54,909 --> 01:05:03,278
people this idea of microbial ratios

1337
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:05,679
your fungal to bacterial ratio being

1338
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:08,009
what destroys your overall soil health

1339
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:11,259
and plant health and by adjusting this

1340
01:05:08,009 --> 01:05:13,630
that's how you really control that like

1341
01:05:11,259 --> 01:05:16,179
that that is the controlling variable

1342
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:17,318
for plant health and so health and

1343
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:19,838
that's something I haven't really been

1344
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:21,639
able to get my brain around as I've

1345
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:23,170
learned more over the years I mean

1346
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:25,808
that's sort of where I started in this

1347
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:27,639
industry with my father but I've kind of

1348
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:28,778
and I don't want to use the word evolved

1349
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:31,778
because I don't think that's fair but I

1350
01:05:28,778 --> 01:05:33,608
would say I've changed my perspective a

1351
01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:35,318
little bit into looking more at minerals

1352
01:05:33,608 --> 01:05:37,119
and nutrients and their effects on soil

1353
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:39,038
health as well and how all of these

1354
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:41,740
things sort of work together but I've

1355
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,559
heard a lot of claims from you know

1356
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:45,879
certain consultants or certain

1357
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:47,410
philosophies around the idea that if you

1358
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,829
know your fungal the bacteria ratio is

1359
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:51,879
right everything else is gets corrected

1360
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:56,680
what are your experience or their

1361
01:05:51,880 --> 01:06:00,880
thoughts with that yeah well one of the

1362
01:05:56,679 --> 01:06:05,649
things that just to touch on that youth

1363
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:08,740
Senate's not into is one

1364
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:11,670
the biggest hole in all of this of our

1365
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:14,879
understanding is in a realm of

1366
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:18,068
interconnectivity and/or in a relation

1367
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,880
so a lot of our study in the microbial

1368
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:24,038
world in the world of how that didn't

1369
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:28,619
microbes interact plants and all this

1370
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:31,240
stuff has been on this kind of odor

1371
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:32,470
concept or concept that I don't think

1372
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:36,250
we're going to be able to keep moving

1373
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:37,778
forward which is isolation and and it

1374
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:40,568
has a role we need to we need to

1375
01:06:37,778 --> 01:06:43,539
understand the microbe individually but

1376
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:45,159
we isolate individual microbes we try

1377
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:47,319
and figure out what their function is

1378
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:51,038
how they work how they contribute to

1379
01:06:47,318 --> 01:06:54,250
this overall idea and we don't actually

1380
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:58,359
understand how they work in community we

1381
01:06:54,250 --> 01:07:01,568
don't have like the the data processing

1382
01:06:58,358 --> 01:07:04,869
the ability to track interconnectivity

1383
01:07:01,568 --> 01:07:09,028
we're just not there technologically we

1384
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:15,640
don't understand how these complex

1385
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:20,079
groups of microbial organisms interact

1386
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:22,558
arm on a level with the nutrients in the

1387
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:26,760
soil on how they help each other or

1388
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:32,319
serve each other that whole zone of

1389
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:35,549
understanding is pretty dark so we we

1390
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:38,920
start like looking at one thing as I am

1391
01:07:35,548 --> 01:07:40,298
scientists or different you know camps

1392
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:43,119
of understanding we're like well I

1393
01:07:40,298 --> 01:07:45,699
understand this I've studied it a lot

1394
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:50,380
and so this might be the whole answer

1395
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:55,259
but really we have this soil column in

1396
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:59,369
any kind of soil grown crop lamp and

1397
01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:02,230
it's full of all kinds of stuff and and

1398
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:05,230
they are organism to smaller organisms

1399
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:06,760
and plants for synthesizing and pushing

1400
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:08,949
things down in the soil and the

1401
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,680
exchanges that happen there and how it

1402
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:13,538
all works together is where we really

1403
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,929
need to grow in understanding that's

1404
01:08:13,539 --> 01:08:18,699
that's where that big hole is because we

1405
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:19,390
don't understand how all the yeasts and

1406
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:21,609
bacteria

1407
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:23,770
together on the leaf of the plan to

1408
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:25,389
actually do something you know what is

1409
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:27,430
that how does that interact them to do

1410
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:31,180
and when it falls in the drip line what

1411
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:32,770
does that do and who's benefiting or how

1412
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,110
the east and the bacteria and the fungi

1413
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,970
work together to process and deal with

1414
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:40,960
minerals and make them plan available

1415
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:45,789
and you know those those areas of

1416
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:48,159
interconnectivity is where the star trek

1417
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:53,140
would be going if they were soil

1418
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:55,930
microbial frontier explore and we're

1419
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:58,150
we're just beginning there to ask the

1420
01:08:55,930 --> 01:09:04,450
right questions and to have tools to

1421
01:08:58,149 --> 01:09:08,649
answer those some but in the world of

1422
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:11,019
fungal bacterial ratios and how that

1423
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:16,779
benefits plants I think it's a huge deal

1424
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:18,730
I think each plant has its ideal zone as

1425
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:23,050
far as I'll go to bacterial reishi I've

1426
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:26,319
seen that evidenced um you know for a

1427
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:29,079
long long time and in my personal life

1428
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:33,449
growing up as a farmers kid and getting

1429
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:36,670
to play with it and and I've actually

1430
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:39,309
done a bunch of research on that front

1431
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:41,380
and seeing incredible results when

1432
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:43,810
messing with the fungal bacterial ratios

1433
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:46,930
and what plants died in what plants

1434
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:50,140
right I almost killed five acres of

1435
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:53,220
trees once by messing with this in the

1436
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:56,020
wrong way before I understood it I took

1437
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:58,659
so when I got in the National farming

1438
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:01,270
first they brought over this machine and

1439
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:02,859
I was doing it I was making it for five

1440
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:05,320
acres and was a ton of work and they

1441
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:07,869
brought over this machine from Korea to

1442
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:09,939
try and make I am out on a large scale

1443
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:13,329
and I was like man if I can just buy

1444
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:17,079
this stuff that's just that's great

1445
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:19,680
and so I bought twenty times I am oh

1446
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:22,989
maybe machine applied it on five acre

1447
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:25,600
block of trees and I nearly killed them

1448
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:28,479
all I mean they all turned the craziest

1449
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,380
yellow like overnight within a week they

1450
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:33,429
were all like it looks like I had just

1451
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:35,350
started them of water

1452
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:39,880
all nutrients combined for over a year

1453
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:42,970
and I was like what happened everything

1454
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,550
else in Orchard's greening thriving only

1455
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:51,090
where I applied this not um did I see

1456
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:54,190
these change like nearly croak and and

1457
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:56,110
so then I that was good time that was a

1458
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:58,269
moment when I realized I can't leave

1459
01:10:56,109 --> 01:11:01,029
understanding this up to anybody else

1460
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:02,440
like if the experts are giving me stuff

1461
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:05,229
that they're gonna kill my crops I need

1462
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:06,369
to know what's going on there's not no

1463
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:07,539
one was extra that that's something

1464
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:11,019
people didn't know what they're doing

1465
01:11:07,539 --> 01:11:12,729
but um so I dug into it I got a

1466
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:18,430
microscope and I looked like what is in

1467
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:21,879
this and it was all bacteria and it was

1468
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:25,060
made in 24 hours and a boiler system

1469
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,920
kind of machine and my trees weren't

1470
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:29,770
having it there was there was nothing

1471
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:33,190
happy about this scenario for them and

1472
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:36,100
what it was that took a kind of stable

1473
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:39,099
soil environment that was far more

1474
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:42,130
hungrily leaning than this inoculum I

1475
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:47,530
put down and I just test it with stray

1476
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:49,390
bacteria and I'm a tree farmer I know

1477
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:53,079
I'm trees not happy and those trees were

1478
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:55,390
not happy and it was just I just messed

1479
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:58,300
up the balance they didn't put poison on

1480
01:11:55,390 --> 01:12:00,460
there wasn't there wasn't any real

1481
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:04,090
nutrients in that it was simply an

1482
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:06,970
inoculum and I almost killed him on the

1483
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:09,630
flip side of that the University of

1484
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:12,550
Hawaii's research and development has

1485
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:15,940
granted me money to research project I

1486
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:19,630
did where I took this invasive with

1487
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:21,819
telling all the Tao and because I I

1488
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:24,460
theorized that it actually does is a

1489
01:12:21,819 --> 01:12:26,199
bacterial loving plant because when we

1490
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:32,260
were conventional in our herbicide

1491
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:36,819
strips ever side the tiger using it I'd

1492
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:38,920
like to say to them the oxygen makes the

1493
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:42,250
soil it reduces the ability for soil

1494
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:44,680
oxygen transfer and so it kills all the

1495
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:46,699
fungus and everything that loves the

1496
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,990
oxygen in the soil and so

1497
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:50,779
they killed everything the first thing

1498
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:53,210
from that bacteria and the first plan to

1499
01:12:50,779 --> 01:12:57,500
thrive in these herbicide strips we used

1500
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:59,180
to get the trees off the ground I was a

1501
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:02,210
nut off the ground with our ground

1502
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:04,010
harvesters was this fire weak it was

1503
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:06,529
always the first thing in the strip's

1504
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:12,140
I was like oh they love crazy bacterial

1505
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:15,409
mmm and and it only messes with a real

1506
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:18,619
kind of surface and soil so it's about

1507
01:13:15,409 --> 01:13:21,800
this complete devastation of but it's

1508
01:13:18,619 --> 01:13:24,140
pretty bad anyway so we don't do that

1509
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:32,300
anymore our trees are happier for it but

1510
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:35,390
what I did for a cow farmer a rancher on

1511
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:37,340
this two acre kind of hobby parcel that

1512
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:39,590
he had no more grass production all the

1513
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,970
antis fire we got these folks to do all

1514
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:41,840
this stuff - it wasn't gonna change

1515
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,789
anything

1516
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,069
and I was like okay he was a friend of

1517
01:13:43,789 --> 01:13:49,039
our family so I went in and I brought a

1518
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:51,380
highly fungal inoculum and I just

1519
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:54,289
applied it and then I seeded some grass

1520
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:56,810
where it had kind of been grass list and

1521
01:13:54,289 --> 01:13:59,269
I watched and over the period of three

1522
01:13:56,810 --> 01:14:02,180
months all the fire weeds died

1523
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:05,750
I got powder in mode you got fur dated

1524
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:08,300
on by a Finch

1525
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,770
so I I would go out and look we didn't

1526
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,510
pull any of those two acres and like I

1527
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:14,600
pulled all the wheat and two acres is

1528
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:16,970
miserable and so I went out and looked

1529
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,890
at it and it would be powdery mildew and

1530
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:20,360
just little scene and time or if you

1531
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:23,600
looked at it right where it messed the

1532
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:25,609
soil be all covered in aces and what

1533
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,870
happened is this plan just became the

1534
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:30,319
weakest thing in the area

1535
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:32,119
all the grass went gangbusters went

1536
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:34,699
ballistic he actually was able to run

1537
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:37,069
for tattle on two acres for two years in

1538
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:39,739
a row and because he couldn't keep up

1539
01:14:37,069 --> 01:14:41,420
with grass production I've since told

1540
01:14:39,739 --> 01:14:44,149
him like that's not a good idea for

1541
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:46,609
sustainability because something it's

1542
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:48,229
his land but right on the other side of

1543
01:14:46,609 --> 01:14:50,479
the fence where we didn't apply I am

1544
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:53,599
though the neighbors faster still was

1545
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:57,139
the exact same problem that still with

1546
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,060
SolidFire we as far as you can see and I

1547
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:00,680
had you age extension agent amount

1548
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,110
university of hawai extension eights

1549
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:06,829
come out and look at this and watched it

1550
01:15:03,109 --> 01:15:09,159
over four years and anyway so we're

1551
01:15:06,829 --> 01:15:12,199
running the trial right now to show that

1552
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:14,059
empirically so that they can use that to

1553
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:15,949
help farmers on the island so they've

1554
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:19,640
spent millions of dollars and to fix the

1555
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:23,000
fire we thought so fungal bacterial

1556
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:24,380
balance yeah I have a couple thoughts on

1557
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,840
that I want to hear your opinion so

1558
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:27,319
first off I loved what you said there

1559
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,319
first

1560
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:32,569
about the how much we don't know about

1561
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,699
soil biology there's a lot we don't

1562
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:36,739
understand I heard a wonderful science

1563
01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:38,420
soil scientist once speak and he talked

1564
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:40,189
about how we know more about what's

1565
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:42,409
going on at the bottom of the ocean and

1566
01:15:40,189 --> 01:15:45,379
in outer space than we do literally

1567
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:47,090
under our feet and it is symbiotic you

1568
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:48,680
know and you can't take an isolate one

1569
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:50,060
microorganism without looking at all the

1570
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:52,369
other so I totally agree with you on

1571
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:54,410
that now when we start talking about

1572
01:15:52,369 --> 01:15:56,300
fungal the bacteria ratio to me that

1573
01:15:54,409 --> 01:15:59,840
feels too simplistic for the reasons you

1574
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:01,520
just stated the idea that we since we

1575
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,380
don't know what's going on the idea that

1576
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,120
we just take a plant succession chart

1577
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:07,130
which is sends our soil succession chart

1578
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:08,449
as soil moves from highly bacterial

1579
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:10,909
towards more fungal and saying

1580
01:16:08,449 --> 01:16:14,439
old-growth forest versus a you know a

1581
01:16:10,909 --> 01:16:17,779
new pasture yes that's the case but I

1582
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:23,210
wonder if that's not being pushed more

1583
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:24,979
by the by the plants that are sort of

1584
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:28,310
incorporating than those areas so the

1585
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:29,779
idea that a grass a grass or a tree you

1586
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,610
know is putting out these XE dates to

1587
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:32,630
select for the type of microorganisms

1588
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:35,000
that are it's going to be most

1589
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:36,890
successful with with tree selecting for

1590
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,350
a more fungal environment and the

1591
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:41,690
grasses or annual crop selecting for

1592
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:46,970
more bacterial environments rather than

1593
01:16:41,689 --> 01:16:49,069
us controlling it and I guess on that

1594
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:52,550
note you gave the example of applying

1595
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:55,309
this IMO solution that essentially

1596
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:58,029
really hurt your macadamia nut trees and

1597
01:16:55,310 --> 01:17:00,800
I'm wondering if it wasn't so much that

1598
01:16:58,029 --> 01:17:03,229
the soil was had a particular bacterial

1599
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,539
fungal ratio but maybe that the bacteria

1600
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:08,839
you applied was more efficient at

1601
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:10,369
utilizing the nutrients in that soil for

1602
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,770
that period of time and so the plan was

1603
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:13,670
actually nitrogen starved or unable to

1604
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:16,280
access

1605
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:19,340
those soil nutrients because or possibly

1606
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:20,719
that bacteria had so much food source

1607
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,980
there that actually created and

1608
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,289
generated you know an exothermic

1609
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:25,609
reaction to reproduction and heated the

1610
01:17:24,289 --> 01:17:27,470
soils around the roots of the plants

1611
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:29,420
which would stress it to you

1612
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:32,110
III just I wonder if there's other

1613
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:34,310
explanations for it beyond just a strict

1614
01:17:32,109 --> 01:17:34,909
bacterial the fungal ratio and I could

1615
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:36,980
be wrong

1616
01:17:34,909 --> 01:17:39,019
you know I'm fully willing to admit that

1617
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:41,239
these are just my initial thoughts

1618
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:43,790
regarding you know sort of that subject

1619
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:48,380
I don't know way I think about any other

1620
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:51,769
yeah and yeah the the potential for

1621
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:54,440
there to be other things specifically on

1622
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:58,280
those trees and then yellowing as a

1623
01:17:54,439 --> 01:18:02,299
result of that totally is it possible

1624
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:05,269
that it was another thing yeah I think I

1625
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:08,600
think what we have is what we can answer

1626
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:09,140
so like for that cropland or that grass

1627
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,050
plant

1628
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:16,010
I took microbial laughs of the whole

1629
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:20,110
place before I started and it was an

1630
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:22,970
extremely you know that's really

1631
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:31,449
grasslands I'm not suitable for grass

1632
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:34,460
production and then I took a master and

1633
01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:38,590
the you know the amoeba increased and

1634
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:43,220
you know all kinds of other you know um

1635
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:45,199
affiliates increased and but the the one

1636
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:48,710
of the big changes was the balance of

1637
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:50,960
fungal the bacterial ratio and so yeah

1638
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:53,329
you can I mean maybe there's an

1639
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,100
invisible reason in the

1640
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:57,649
interconnectivity of all this that we

1641
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:01,430
don't yet know how to look at and that

1642
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:04,069
could be the cause but I think right now

1643
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:06,440
what I have to work with and the power

1644
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:10,729
of observation I'm looking at that and

1645
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:13,879
saying these plants don't like it when

1646
01:19:10,729 --> 01:19:17,329
there's talent soil fumbly to bacteria

1647
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:20,960
II and I think that's probably pretty

1648
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:24,109
accurate and could there be a lot more

1649
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,579
to it totally but I think where we're at

1650
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:27,739
and understanding that it's a pretty

1651
01:19:25,579 --> 01:19:31,069
good

1652
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:35,659
Toula now it might be that there were

1653
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:39,319
looking at some some disconnected cause

1654
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:41,659
or effect of something more complex that

1655
01:19:39,319 --> 01:19:46,819
we don't yet understand and that that's

1656
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:49,729
possible but I think that it might be

1657
01:19:46,819 --> 01:19:52,840
just reasonable to say yeah there's

1658
01:19:49,729 --> 01:19:58,909
something to this fungal bacterial ratio

1659
01:19:52,840 --> 01:20:01,369
how forests grow and yeah yeah and this

1660
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:04,420
is tough for me because I totally agree

1661
01:20:01,369 --> 01:20:09,409
with you on what you're saying I just I

1662
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:11,779
cautious about drawing a conclusion from

1663
01:20:09,409 --> 01:20:14,869
a result without knowing what all the

1664
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:17,989
variables may be so when we like for

1665
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:19,670
just to use this example of this IMO

1666
01:20:17,989 --> 01:20:22,309
solution that you apply to the macadamia

1667
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:24,829
nut trees we don't know what it is about

1668
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:26,660
that application that caused the results

1669
01:20:24,829 --> 01:20:28,130
that it did and and you think it's you

1670
01:20:26,659 --> 01:20:30,319
know you believe it was because of the

1671
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:32,390
fungal bacterial ratio and I'm just

1672
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:33,679
suggesting maybe it was from something

1673
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:35,869
else entirely

1674
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:38,990
having to do with that solution maybe it

1675
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:40,819
was too acidic or the pH was offer I

1676
01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:44,210
have no idea I'm making stuff up at this

1677
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:46,789
point but the idea that we we observe

1678
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:48,500
something with nature and then have to

1679
01:20:46,789 --> 01:20:50,569
be able to replicate it but also be able

1680
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,699
to draw the correct conclusions for what

1681
01:20:50,569 --> 01:20:55,250
the mechanism of action is I think is

1682
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:57,529
really important and it may very well be

1683
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:59,119
like you said this fungal bacterial

1684
01:20:57,529 --> 01:21:00,859
ratio but it's just it brings up a sort

1685
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:02,300
of a greater philosophical question for

1686
01:21:00,859 --> 01:21:04,339
me when we evaluate all of these

1687
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:09,920
methodologies and all of these ideas

1688
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:12,560
around around farming is all yeah and if

1689
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,949
I can go and spray this fungal erased

1690
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,039
inoculum and kill fire weed while making

1691
01:21:15,949 --> 01:21:23,199
grassland an increase in fertility

1692
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:25,670
well then even if I don't understand

1693
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:28,460
exactly what's going on there I've

1694
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:33,350
employed the principles of observation

1695
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:36,710
and fine to come to a conclusion that I

1696
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:39,710
can tend to the fungal life of grassland

1697
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:40,788
well and kill a noxious weed well

1698
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:42,559
increasing for that

1699
01:21:40,788 --> 01:21:45,288
and thus increasing the dollars in the

1700
01:21:42,559 --> 01:21:48,048
pocket for a farmer and I might not need

1701
01:21:45,288 --> 01:21:51,349
to understand a whole lot more for

1702
01:21:48,048 --> 01:21:54,229
effective use of these pencils sure I

1703
01:21:51,349 --> 01:21:55,760
mean totally at the end of the day it

1704
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:57,439
all comes down to plant growth and

1705
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,869
health and soil growth and how often

1706
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,789
you're obviously a very successful

1707
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:03,438
farmer and have had great success with

1708
01:22:01,788 --> 01:22:05,478
this and what you're doing I think is

1709
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:06,918
amazing and I love the fact you're

1710
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:08,869
working with the University to spread

1711
01:22:06,918 --> 01:22:10,578
these ideas and get research done on

1712
01:22:08,868 --> 01:22:13,098
these ideas like I think that's just

1713
01:22:10,578 --> 01:22:14,719
that's just incredible so please don't

1714
01:22:13,099 --> 01:22:18,229
take any of my suggestions or comments

1715
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:20,359
as in any sort of negative way cuz that

1716
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:22,280
only is not my intent I just I enjoy the

1717
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:25,548
discussion and I like trying to figure

1718
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:27,139
out the how and why behind what you're

1719
01:22:25,548 --> 01:22:28,939
seeing we know what we're observing I

1720
01:22:27,139 --> 01:22:31,338
think and that's that to me is a journey

1721
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:32,719
it's not it's not black and white and

1722
01:22:31,338 --> 01:22:35,298
it's not anything that's good or bad

1723
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,769
it's just it's just it's it's

1724
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:41,118
fascinating and I think it's something

1725
01:22:36,769 --> 01:22:44,269
we want to keep striving towards I'm in

1726
01:22:41,118 --> 01:22:46,458
no way offended and I think it's really

1727
01:22:44,269 --> 01:22:47,510
important to have those conversations I

1728
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:50,238
agree

1729
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:55,010
and and I think that what we're gonna

1730
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:56,958
come to as we learn and and kind of come

1731
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:59,389
to write thought or how things actually

1732
01:22:56,958 --> 01:23:02,179
work we're just gonna keep partnering

1733
01:22:59,389 --> 01:23:06,498
with our nature works I think whoever

1734
01:23:02,179 --> 01:23:09,019
painted nature the painter of it is got

1735
01:23:06,498 --> 01:23:11,029
a pretty good touch it does be the

1736
01:23:09,019 --> 01:23:13,399
deeper I dig into looking at it under a

1737
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:17,719
microscope and and understanding some of

1738
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:19,939
these interconnectivity things the more

1739
01:23:17,719 --> 01:23:22,760
I just go wow so I go symptom me like

1740
01:23:19,939 --> 01:23:25,999
like literally everybody's playing their

1741
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:29,239
their tune and in in flawless you know

1742
01:23:25,998 --> 01:23:31,279
kind of combination even even it in

1743
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:33,408
degrees with chaos you know where

1744
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:35,298
there's life there's beat composition

1745
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:38,268
and there's new growth and it's still

1746
01:23:35,298 --> 01:23:40,849
like a symphony it's it's really fun I

1747
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:43,998
really enjoy it and I think thank what

1748
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:45,949
you're saying is is um is on where like

1749
01:23:43,998 --> 01:23:48,429
what what is things are actually doing

1750
01:23:45,948 --> 01:23:51,259
this how can we better partner with that

1751
01:23:48,429 --> 01:23:53,980
yeah well I know I know you have to get

1752
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:55,090
going right now so we can sign off

1753
01:23:53,979 --> 01:23:57,099
but I just want to say thanks for your

1754
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:59,560
time today and I know we didn't get we

1755
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:02,280
didn't totally talk about KNF maybe as

1756
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:04,420
much as I wanted to or you wanted to but

1757
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:06,939
I'd love to follow up with you another

1758
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:08,649
time and just and just chat and maybe

1759
01:24:06,939 --> 01:24:13,029
I'll have another person on to talk hey

1760
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:15,939
enough here in the near future cool man

1761
01:24:13,029 --> 01:24:17,130
well thanks for having me and yes super

1762
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:20,049
good doctor

1763
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:22,210
that was Chris Trump a master natural

1764
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:24,039
farmer certified by Master Choa of Korea
