1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
this is what I think makes microscope

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:09,200
work so interesting so when we look at

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,808
the karanji cake now added to the exact

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:16,350
same compost was before that we added

5
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:21,140
the neem to I wasn't able to find any

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:29,849
fungal hyphae and this we zoom in here

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:34,859
that's just 400 times magnification you

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:36,359
can see we have some bacteria but

9
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,780
nothing near what appears to be the

10
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:43,409
levels that we had with the neem cake

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,820
but certainly more than the control and

12
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,709
this one had a very different appearance

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,100
the water actually turned a grayish

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:54,020
color it's kind of murky looking but you

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,370
can see some guys cruising around there

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,090
I'm curious to see how this will look in

17
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,089
another 12 hours
