00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,478
all about water drram is an industry

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,680
leader when it comes to equipment

23
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,560
related to irrigation and horiculture my

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,680
guest this week is Les Evans Les has a

experience helping Growers of all types

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,880
of crops with their environmental and

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,118
water quality challenges L's day-to-day

32
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,959
involves supporting the dram sales team

33
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,319
and their customers with water treatment

34
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,719
designs that maximize investment while

35
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,639
minimizing environmental impact when

36
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,478
he's not at his desk he can be found

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,040
planting perennials with his family or

38
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,158
running the NC mountains to Sea Trail

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,479
system a Stones thrown away from his

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,159
home in Raleigh now on to the

41
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:53,438
show hey Les thanks for coming on the

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,118
podcast appreciate it I I am really

43
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,279
happy to be here thanks for having me

44
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,640
Ted yeah I you are actually the third

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,599
dram person person to come on the

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,159
podcast uh we were talking before the

47
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,118
show and you mentioned uh reminded me

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,280
that Casey schenberg had been on the

49
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,919
podcast talking about fish hydraulis

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,199
State and how it's made if folks want to

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,399
go back and check that out and then the

52
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,280
wonderful Kurt Becker also came on and

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,280
talked about all things water so we're

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,280
going to do a similar sort of style

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,479
podcast today I I recently caught your

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,519
webinar on dissolved oxygen and I will

57
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,039
link to that for folks who want to go on

58
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,680
a deeper dive specifically into dissolve

59
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,000
oxygen we will talk about it today uh

60
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,519
but I really have just a a random list

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,199
of questions related to water that I

62
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,080
think will be useful for Growers to

63
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,439
think about as they think about their

64
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,480
water source but uh can you tell me a

65
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,039
little bit about yourself before we dive

66
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,359
into the

67
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,318
podcast sure yeah um entered the

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,200
greenhouse and Nursery space now we call

69
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:59,079
it ca in 1995 out of NC State University

70
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,439
biological engineer water soil and

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,879
environmental engine engering

72
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,560
concentration got really lucky hired by

73
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,878
a Swedish firm uh that is really

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,400
involved in controlling the environment

75
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:12,039
in green houses right out of school and

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,239
just they sent me around the world and I

77
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,959
started seeing a lot of neat um ways to

78
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,759
grow plants and have been in the

79
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,519
industry just ever since been with drram

80
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:27,439
for I'd have to do the math 12 13 14

81
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,519
years um you mentioned Kurt Becker and

82
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,639
Casey it's a neat team it's from we

83
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,480
really FR does a great job we're from

84
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,759
all over the place um in terms of

85
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,719
backgrounds and dram water sort of

86
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,798
officially became a thing I'm making it

87
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,280
up 10 years ago and we started really

88
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,519
putting uh water projects together so my

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,199
job at dram is sort of the lead designer

90
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,840
uh we have a lot of vendors of course

91
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,639
that we work with and we take a

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,640
customers's new project or problem uh

93
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,199
specifically again in dram water with

94
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,518
their with their water um and growing

95
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,399
plants and we put packages together for

96
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,438
them uh that could look like a very

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,519
complex system or hopefully a very

98
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:13,280
simple system dissolved oxygen has

99
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,719
become more of a topic every year uh

100
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,680
we've been learning a lot more about how

101
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,358
important dissolved oxygen is in terms

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,040
of growing a healthy plant um and so

103
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,758
it's just something that we always are

104
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,199
talking about um from again the most

105
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
simple to most complex growing

106
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,759
situations um dissolved oxygen is

107
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,959
something that just is not going away

108
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,439
and the more we learn about it the the

109
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:41,560
more we we realize how vital it can be

110
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:43,519
to growing a efficient healthy plant so

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,079
that's that's where we're at and yeah

112
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,439
thanks for I'm glad you were able to see

113
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,000
that webinar that the magazine hosted

114
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,240
for

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,600
us yeah so and just a reminder for folks

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,720
if you are looking for a more complete

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,600
engineering solution for your water in a

118
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,320
commercial ftil facility or Greenhouse

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,400
dram is a wonderful resource for that um

120
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,680
it is actually quite complex the amount

121
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,439
of variables and things that go into

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,280
that sort of a system um so I can't

123
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,759
recommend them enough they also since

124
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,799
we're talking about a little bit about

125
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,879
their products as a quick plug uh they

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
make these wonderful Water breaker wands

127
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,759
uh that was I think where you started in

128
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:28,239
the industry as well as uh probably one

129
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,319
of the best sprayers um commercial

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,759
sprayers that I've ever seen and a very

131
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,280
cool nematode bucket that Suzanne

132
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,120
absolutely loves so they have a wide

133
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,719
range of products uh that are definitely

134
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,240
worth checking out uh but even if you're

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,600
not a commercial scale grower a lot of

136
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,319
what we're going to talk about today I

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,400
think will just apply to water in

138
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,639
general I I even think about it in terms

139
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,879
of um a homeg grower so uh let's just

140
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,680
start with dissolved

141
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:58,240
oxygen starting there uh the the big

142
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,360
takeaways from your your webinar on that

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,319
was that raising dissolve oxygen led to

144
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,280
much healthier plant outcomes can you

145
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,720
kind of expand on that though in Greater

146
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,079
detail yeah absolutely so generally we

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,800
are unable to apply as much dissolved

148
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,959
oxygen as we're learning the plant would

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,680
like to have that's the bottom line

150
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:23,000
rather if it's if it's the reservoir in

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,918
my basement grow uh or you know a

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,439
100,000 gallon tank or straight well

153
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,079
water or what have you it just we aren't

154
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,639
providing that uh root zone system and

155
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,120
that plant enough dissolved oxygen to be

156
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,598
in its happy place is kind of how I

157
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,720
think about it um and the more we learn

158
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,319
about its happy place the more complex

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,479
it gets but it boils down to a lot of

160
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,280
symbiotic things working well together

161
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:53,598
to efficiently do what we also want to

162
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:58,758
happen which is to have a healthy plant

163
00:06:53,598 --> 00:07:02,478
grow as much flower or fruit or color or

164
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,840
whatever we want that plant to do um as

165
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,000
possible and so dissolved oxygen is

166
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,878
something that is part of every

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
conversation we have um sometimes we

168
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,759
aren't doing anything to manipulate it

169
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,319
because we might have uh enough uh but

170
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,680
again it's it's generally we're talking

171
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:22,319
about ways of uh even keeping what we

172
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,639
did start with in the water longer and

173
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,639
getting it to the actual crop but and a

174
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,560
lot of times it's mechanically adding it

175
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,120
to a system to be able to get it to the

176
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,800
crop but like you said it can be um it's

177
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,000
just a lot of conversations

178
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,280
conversations and under

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,560
understanding uh what what we're growing

180
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,638
um what the media is what fertilizer

181
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,000
regime you are are you organic are you

182
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,038
salts are you combination so all of this

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,319
again it's it's a conversation to

184
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:55,000
understand U but we know that dissolved

185
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,280
oxygen as an input should not be ignored

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,759
right so we're looking at all these

187
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,198
other things that we're apply you know

188
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,199
that we're doing to grow our plant let's

189
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,960
not ignore dissolved

190
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,120
oxygen now if I have a reservoir it's

191
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,638
very simple to add a bubbler and that

192
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:16,000
will get me what to sort of a ambient

193
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:19,038
level of dissolved oxygen potentially

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,759
and then there are ways to Super

195
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:25,079
saturate the water can you touch on what

196
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:30,199
that technology looks like perfect I I

197
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:32,038
can geek out on um the res

198
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,038
increasing dissolved oxygen and not

199
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,519
shooting ourselves in the foot in doing

200
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:40,240
so I've learned from a lot of the best

201
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:43,759
and a lot of uh colleagues and a lot of

202
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,959
uh friends in terms of uh and the

203
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,600
smaller the

204
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,439
reservoir the harder it can be to not

205
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,159
shoot yourself in the

206
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,360
foot um and I bottom line is we don't

207
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,399
want to overheat the Water by putting a

208
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,800
a a nice even if it's a really high-end

209
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,078
Aras Stone in the bottom of a 20 gallon

210
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,039
res um we might be increasing the

211
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,719
temperature dramatically and that causes

212
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,719
other issues and it becomes a lot harder

213
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,759
to keep any dissolved oxygen in that

214
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,278
water if we've increased the temperature

215
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,600
of that water and so be careful what we

216
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,200
like to do is pick an appropriate

217
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,320
technology and now there's just like you

218
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,800
said some wonderfully simple things to

219
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,120
do um and then if we can stir the water

220
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,278
it might be our classic dropping a fish

221
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,519
little two gallon a minute fish pump in

222
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:36,240
my small Reservoir um or I might use

223
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,839
fancy Mass transfer nozzles in a 10,000

224
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,039
gallon tank but we're stirring the water

225
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,720
to keep that dissolved oxygen in

226
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,480
solution longer we're not mixing or

227
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,839
bubbling the water that's just going to

228
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,240
raise it to the surface inappropriately

229
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,360
if we have made True dissolved oxygen um

230
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,600
and we can keep it in the water longer

231
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,759
so again depending on the vessel if we

232
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,600
do have storage again from a 25-gallon

233
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,639
reservoir to a 5,000 gallon or 50,000

234
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,759
gallon tank there's different

235
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:12,078
methodologies in adding and keeping the

236
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,078
dissolved oxygen in solution uh so

237
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:18,958
that's a really fun conversation again

238
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,719
whether it be just a hom grower um with

239
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,119
or a commercial grower we're going to

240
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,240
look at different ways of enhancing or

241
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,679
just keeping what we can in in in

242
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,919
solution so temperature plays a a big

243
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:36,638
role in terms of the water's capacity to

244
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:39,319
retain oxygen as the water gets warmer

245
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,799
it can it can't hold as much um I'm also

246
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,000
thinking that we have to water with

247
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,479
water that's temperature appropriate for

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,240
the crop that we're growing you know we

249
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,920
don't want to water with 50 degree

250
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,519
temperature water so what does that

251
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:56,000
balance look like yep so you're right

252
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,759
we're generally aiming for industry

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,240
standards 68 70 degrees Fahrenheit right

254
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,159
that's our that's our general happy

255
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,039
place to not Shock young root systems

256
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,199
anything under you know plants can

257
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,319
handle quite a lot obviously uh but we

258
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,120
don't want to apply cold water to the

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
younger the plant the more detrimental

260
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,200
it can become we've we've lots of

261
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,319
studies out there cold water to a

262
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,680
younger root system can really slow

263
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,959
things down dramatically a few hours of

264
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,559
really cold water we've seen affect even

265
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:29,000
a cannabis a vigorous cannabis species

266
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,958
uh it can slow it down by many days if

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,120
not weeks so that those are interesting

268
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,359
studies to go and look so really wow

269
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,320
really pay more attention I don't I mean

270
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,079
I'm the dissolved oxygen guy sort of or

271
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,800
one of many but pay very much attention

272
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:47,199
to not applying too cold of water um if

273
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,159
you're nice buffered big living soil

274
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,240
environment it's kind of got its own

275
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,399
warmth so to speak it's going to ma not

276
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,440
matter so much but if you're hydroponic

277
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,320
grower if you're growing in Stones you

278
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
know if you just have a more media less

279
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
media free en environment that water

280
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,078
temperature is really affecting and the

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,639
younger we're trying to grow those root

282
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,439
hairs we're trying to do all these

283
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,000
processes and if it's too cold things

284
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,360
are just thinking oh I got to go into

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,480
dormant I'm I'm getting ready for

286
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,159
something but it's not fruiting right

287
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,320
it's the opposite so just think about

288
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:22,039
the the seasonal changes so again I I

289
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,519
digress but the colder the water we can

290
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,240
hold more dissolved oxygen well let's

291
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,399
make it really cold so I can get more

292
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,839
dissolved oxygen no there is that fine

293
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,519
line that you just mentioned we're

294
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,320
aiming for Mid 60s mid 70s is the happy

295
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,959
place and we can put in five six seven

296
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,160
eight parts per million of dissolved

297
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,439
oxygen within that temperature can we

298
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,399
get it to the crop you know and again

299
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,440
again what else is in the water what

300
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,799
what's going to steal from the oxygen

301
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,519
that we're trying to create um the

302
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:56,159
biofilms the just goo you know uh some

303
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,000
of our soils we're adding dissolved

304
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,838
oxygen let's let's get it to the

305
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,240
beneficial microbes let's get it to the

306
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,000
appropriate things in the rizosphere um

307
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,360
before it gets stolen in the piping

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,679
system or just again high temperature is

309
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,919
bad it's going to come out of solution

310
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,838
really quickly we can't hold as much too

311
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,919
cold has its own problems so there's

312
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,440
that happy medium when applying it to

313
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,120
plants yeah one question I asked you off

314
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,240
air that I was curious about is what Doo

315
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,159
levels are we getting using a dram Water

316
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,799
breaker watering head because in my in

317
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:32,719
my brain I figured there's got to be

318
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:35,759
some Doo getting added just from the

319
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,040
mechanism of the way the water is being

320
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,439
split into such small particles but

321
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,278
maybe I'm totally wrong what are your

322
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,639
thoughts around something like

323
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:48,320
that and my answer was I think if we

324
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,320
start at zero if we have just wellwater

325
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,560
or a municipal water coming right out of

326
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,600
the spet right out of our faucet and

327
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,159
it's near zero probably uh we might be

328
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,079
lucky and have a couple parts per

329
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:02,600
million that's still not a good level of

330
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,679
oxygen right so we're going to get

331
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,399
things happening in Reverse if we apply

332
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,799
anoxic or hypoxic water to a root system

333
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,198
things are going to go in reverse right

334
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,120
we're stealing oxygen out of the plant

335
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,879
because of Osmosis properties right so

336
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,720
we've got to make sure we get that

337
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:23,120
minimum when we say five parts per

338
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,399
million does a Water breaker

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,240
help it has to do with so many things

340
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,720
there's so many different flavors of

341
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Water breaker

342
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,040
um if you haven't been to a a garden

343
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,399
center um you know and seen the drram

344
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,198
water Breakers typically on the retail

345
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,480
side and what we see at home grows is

346
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,240
the 400 hole Water breaker the original

347
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,039
aluminum one you can still buy it's a

348
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,399
nice beefy one you can drag around on

349
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,799
the concrete it's not going to get hurt

350
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,639
there's the plastic ones but they have

351
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,399
400 holes you can purchase a thousand

352
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,278
holes generally the idea for the Water

353
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,600
breaker was to break up the water to

354
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,078
soften the water to not compact the top

355
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,440
layer of the

356
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:06,679
soil in which you know which helps us

357
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,519
have a more poorer soil which allows

358
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:13,120
more oxygen to do what it needs to do in

359
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:17,519
the root zone so the original idea was

360
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:22,039
not to probably add dissolved oxygen via

361
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:24,039
the water breaking um mechanism of a of

362
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,958
a dram Water breaker or anybody's Water

363
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,519
breaker but I think that you're right

364
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:32,399
it's got to increase it if we started at

365
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,360
zero I think it's going to help if I

366
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,120
happen to supply 10 parts per million of

367
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,959
do I might lose dissolved oxygen because

368
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,039
it's smashing against the screen and now

369
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,879
it's introducing it to a lower

370
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,639
environment so it's going to try to

371
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,838
reach equilibrium so if I came at it

372
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,440
with a real high like if I'm got a dram

373
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,639
water system and I've got 30 parts per

374
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,360
million in my reservoir and then I'm

375
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:03,159
spraying it out of my hose it's going to

376
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,959
decrease it versus uh if you can imagine

377
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:09,039
spaghetti tube you know drip

378
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:11,638
irrigation right to the soil we have 30

379
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,559
parts per million in the tank and a lot

380
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,399
of that if not most of that depending on

381
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,638
distances and and elbows and stuff a

382
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,318
drip emitter is going to get right to

383
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,919
the crop you know right down into it if

384
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:27,159
it's a steak or a weight or what however

385
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,919
we're doing versus hand watering we're

386
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:32,360
actually going to get rid of all of that

387
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:34,759
that 30 PPM of dissolved oxygen out of a

388
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,879
dram Water breaker it softens the water

389
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,720
it feels great we're not Splat you know

390
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,559
we're not smashing our soil everywhere

391
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,959
but we're actually going to be taking 30

392
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,838
and knocking it down hard because of the

393
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:49,439
pressure change so another thing that

394
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,319
takes gases dissolved oxygen out of

395
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,079
water is a pressure change right so that

396
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:57,039
we're battling pressure changes also

397
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,198
high temperature pressure changes you

398
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,679
know two things that are going to take

399
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,120
dissolved oxygen out of the water so

400
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,240
it's a neat conversation and I mentioned

401
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,439
the screen air I think is the name of

402
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,038
it is actually meant to it's a it's a

403
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,759
very expensive Water breaker for larger

404
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,599
pots that are going to have you have

405
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,400
longer grow times and it just really

406
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,798
softens the water it's got uh inputs on

407
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,600
the top of the nozzle to allow air in as

408
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:27,199
that stream comes through so we're kind

409
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,119
of infusing more air than we ever would

410
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,120
in a normal Water breaker but the green

411
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,918
Air dram green air is a neat funny thing

412
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:38,239
for for generally much larger pots in

413
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,919
your outdoor grows uh that that's

414
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,200
definitely helping taking well water

415
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,520
generally in in a Big Field of hemp or

416
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,600
cannabis especially you know that's

417
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:50,359
going to be out they all season so can

418
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:55,119
talk about water breakers for for hours

419
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:57,158
now when we water with any type of water

420
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,558
regardless the do level we're we're also

421
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,559
pushing oxygen as a physical mechanism

422
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,599
of that water pushing oxygen down into

423
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,200
the soil as well

424
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,119
correct right so depending on what that

425
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,720
soil looks like if you are if you have

426
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:14,038
do in your water and you're and again

427
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,240
depending on if we can get dissolved

428
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,038
oxygen

429
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,798
to the surface or even subsurface lots

430
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,879
of sub irrigation out there obviously um

431
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:29,319
you know so again depending on how we're

432
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,480
applying the water um and uh So Many

433
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,720
Factors you know what is it clear water

434
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,480
that we're applying to a living soil is

435
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,960
it fertilized water uh with just salts

436
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,519
or if we added things to it um so again

437
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,440
we depending on how we've made the

438
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,319
dissolved oxygen and what form it's in

439
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,440
is it truly dissolved is it soluble in

440
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,359
the water and then how we're applying it

441
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,919
to the crop but if we're just handw

442
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:55,879
watering it onto the surface that's

443
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,280
probably an inefficient way honestly if

444
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,400
we've made a lot of dissolved oxygen i'

445
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,038
do what ever I could to sort of get it

446
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,519
smoothly we say laminarly laminer flow

447
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,798
through a

448
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,879
hose and then gently onto it it's going

449
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:13,759
to keep the oxygen in solution longer

450
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,400
than a Water breaker would

451
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,679
so be cognizant of what you're using a

452
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,480
Water breaker to do obviously it's a

453
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,480
wonderful watering tool and it's there

454
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,919
for a big reason U but we don't want to

455
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,679
shoot ourselves in the foot yeah so what

456
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,038
options do I have in a scenario like

457
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,159
like here at my house I've used using a

458
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:35,679
essentially a drip irrigation system uh

459
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,360
directly from my hose which is hooked up

460
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,679
to Municipal Water

461
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:44,918
Supply how can I address dissolve oxy

462
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,159
oxygen in a situation like this uh where

463
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't have a reservoir or is are there

464
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,760
any affordable options for Growers like

465
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,679
myself in this

466
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,640
scenario great question

467
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,440
um it very difficult so Venturi

468
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,240
injectors and we don't I don't think we

469
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,000
make it anymore but it was a really neat

470
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,640
tool the thy inject there are others out

471
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,079
there uh it is a ventury injector that

472
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,038
is just pulling air if you're leaving

473
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,439
the tube out of usually it was used to

474
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,919
put a nutrient uh knock the PH down you

475
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,038
would put it in your bucket and it just

476
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,000
had a tube and it's just using the water

477
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,319
flow across it but we could use it to

478
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,839
introduce atmospheric air has 21% oxygen

479
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:30,359
right let's not forget um and so that's

480
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,158
it is urine the most common and

481
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,439
trickiest way if you don't have a

482
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,600
reservoir if you aren't uh if you aren't

483
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,600
refilling a

484
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:42,879
reservoir um and then utilizing that for

485
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,798
watering um I'm in a Prohibition state

486
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,960
so I'm going to state that in my

487
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:52,158
Perpetual tomato garden um I have a

488
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,880
reservoir and it refills and I add

489
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,440
oxygen to it and I use uh a sub

490
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,280
irrigation platform that I just it's

491
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,038
super easy and when I was travel a lot I

492
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,918
could rely on things to keep happening

493
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,839
when I needed to leave um but that's I I

494
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,679
had zero parts per million do and it

495
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,399
worried me just because I was going to

496
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,038
be pulling from my and especially in sub

497
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,320
irrigation where it's just sort of using

498
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,158
that water as it needs to the little

499
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:21,439
valve opens and I'm you know it's it's

500
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,520
cool it's an easy way with a living soil

501
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,798
to to grow you know uh my tomatoes

502
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,519
really efficiently um but I had it

503
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,000
hooked up like you did and I just felt

504
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,038
like I was adding probably some

505
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,798
inappropriate things even if I was using

506
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,400
a little one of those RV carbon filters

507
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:39,639
which I really enjoyed it was doing a

508
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,840
pretty good job uh good for a few

509
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,640
thousand gallons um so to answer your

510
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,278
question is maybe ventu injection but

511
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,679
that's could be tricky and I'm going to

512
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,240
think on that one because it's something

513
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,559
that we get asked a lot um it's just

514
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,759
really the media the porosity of your

515
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:57,798
media make sure that if you're using

516
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,640
soils over and over again that you are

517
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,480
making sure it's been well you know

518
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,520
Blended and do all those things that you

519
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,319
guys teach us about in terms of uh soil

520
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,440
Health but it's really making sure that

521
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,720
we have air spaces in there to allow

522
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,200
natural things to happen and that we do

523
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,919
not overwater

524
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,480
underwatering bad overwatering of cour

525
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,720
just as bad um and so we try to teach

526
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,919
especially new production cannabis

527
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,839
Growers um to be uh drier Growers right

528
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,159
don't don't just irrigate for the sake

529
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,879
of irrigation let's look at the moisture

530
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,880
level depending on your media let's make

531
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,480
sure that we are not it's generally an

532
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,080
over irrigation problem um and that bad

533
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,919
for a number of reasons in a hom grow

534
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,000
you're not worried about wasting a few

535
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,400
few dollars or nutrients or Organics but

536
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,240
the larger facility that becomes a big

537
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,320
issue but it's just you start chasing

538
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,120
your tail if you're over irrigating um

539
00:22:54,319 --> 00:23:00,119
in terms of the media saturation and

540
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:04,119
paracity and available oxygen

541
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:06,759
I I find with folks switching

542
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,319
from a more traditional hydroponic or

543
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,359
chemical growing mineral salt

544
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:14,558
environment to Growing with living soils

545
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,719
they actually tend to underwater because

546
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,639
they're used to these pretty big dryb

547
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,159
backs um so I'm coming at from a

548
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,840
different perspective interestingly

549
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,559
enough um yes overwatering leads to root

550
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,359
hair death which will cause a lot of the

551
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:31,960
same issues as underwatering um and and

552
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,678
is potentially just as awful I will say

553
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,880
you're opening yourself up to more root

554
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,880
diseases like fusarium pythium uh things

555
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,600
like that and that's a big reason not to

556
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,080
overwater um and that's so we I was

557
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,199
actually just having a conversation I'm

558
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,960
not a huge fan of sub irrigating sub

559
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,759
irrigation but if you're a new grower I

560
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,919
think it's a excellent option or like in

561
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,200
your case where you're having to leave

562
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,520
for a while um it's a it's a wonderful

563
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,840
tool to keep from avoiding these you

564
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:06,798
know massive fluctuations in hydrology

565
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:10,278
that cause these problems so it it

566
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:14,798
allowed us nonprofessional Green Thumb

567
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:18,400
folks it allows you to get by really

568
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:21,679
well but it is not steerable in any sort

569
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,480
of way now we have massive production

570
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,399
and I've been involved with flood floors

571
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,679
since 19 forever ago flood benches flood

572
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,519
floors have been a large component of

573
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,399
you know large scale commercial

574
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,918
horiculture from ornamentals to

575
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:38,239
vegetables Etc of course so we do know

576
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,880
that it can be very very effective yeah

577
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,038
depending on the crop and all these

578
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,720
things but you've got to know what

579
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,839
you're doing and again it's just tougher

580
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,798
to steer crop like you said so there's

581
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:50,439
great yeah goods and bads depending on

582
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,960
what you're trying to accomplish 100%

583
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,038
agree all right well let's uh let's move

584
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,558
on from dissolved oxygen you you've

585
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,119
definitely got me thinking though and I

586
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,720
want I'm going to want look into now uh

587
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,000
adding a carbon filter we'll talk a

588
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,558
little bit more about filtration but

589
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,278
also a uh Venturi injector sort of into

590
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,480
my system before it gets to irrigation

591
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,278
and just see I'll have to see what I can

592
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,759
what I can do I used to have a deer I'll

593
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,919
have to track that down there's little

594
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,480
little levels and I worked for biotherm

595
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,000
if you if you know the biotherm guys I

596
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,000
was there for nine years working for

597
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,480
them they have the O2 tube and not to

598
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
plug at company but we use their their

599
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,720
their dos X Series which is diffus which

600
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
is Mass transfer gas infusion in this

601
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,880
case oxygen so they have small systems

602
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,960
you know for real small hobby sized

603
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,679
grows to really do a impressive job I

604
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,079
don't know how small they go though so

605
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,440
that's a product that came on board a

606
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,079
lot later after I left working for them

607
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,679
but again there's companies out there

608
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,599
that you can go and research and I think

609
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,440
it'd be fun to incorporate I would

610
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,759
carbon filter we'll talk about that

611
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:02,480
before you spend the money to infuse any

612
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,759
Oxygen into it but great so like I said

613
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,558
we're going to jump around I want to

614
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,158
cover a lot of questions that people

615
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:09,678
just have that are just really general

616
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,880
questions about water so let's start off

617
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,640
talking about the differences between

618
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,278
chlorine and chloramine for people that

619
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:21,200
are on Municipal

620
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:25,240
Water great question I am not the PHD on

621
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,558
this subject but have had to be the uh

622
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,359
what's that commercial I stated a

623
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,278
holiday in express last night if

624
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,079
familiar like all of a sudden you sort

625
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:36,960
of oh well but on that I'm an

626
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:39,480
expert um anyway the chlorine has been

627
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,679
traditionally used as an oxidizer an

628
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,720
effective oxidizer chlorine as we all

629
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,320
know has been used in pools um and in

630
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,519
municipal water treatment plants for for

631
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,519
eons um it does what it does and

632
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,599
generally becomes harmless if we are

633
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,278
doing it correctly which of course we

634
00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:01,639
have learned to do in our City municipal

635
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:03,839
systems what we've learned not we the

636
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,200
the water treatment folks have needed to

637
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,240
get more residual they've needed this

638
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,960
disinfection power to last longer

639
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,839
chlorine again U has you know its

640
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,798
Half-Life is decent enough to do what it

641
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,959
needs to do and we probably aren't

642
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:21,639
getting I hope a lot of free chlorine

643
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,159
parts per million out of you know your

644
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,480
faucet if you're smelling chlorine i'

645
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,960
probably call you know the the city if

646
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,679
I'm on a municip system and you can

647
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,120
smell chlorine like a swimming pool or

648
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,960
something that's probably not the levels

649
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,558
you want coming into your home um or

650
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,759
certainly you'd need to consider trying

651
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,119
to get rid of it in your home before and

652
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:45,879
so it's really trying to keep pipes

653
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,719
clean um chloramines were added again

654
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,240
they become trickier from what I've

655
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,759
learned and uh we had a quick chat about

656
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,000
it before we started recording

657
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:57,519
chloramines have been added and they've

658
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,359
been really added uh we've seen since Co

659
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,640
and so when they started testing the um

660
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,359
effluence going back into water

661
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,679
treatment they can study how you know

662
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,319
the covid trends I guess they started

663
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,559
getting nervous and they started turning

664
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:14,918
up the dial on a higher residual

665
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:16,720
chloramine yep and we saw certain uh

666
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,880
Municipal plants and these are generally

667
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,360
from dram water working with cannabis

668
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,159
facilities new facilities some of them

669
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:28,479
uh smaller operations other msos that

670
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,880
had been burned in one state and really

671
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,079
with us taking a hard look at Municipal

672
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,000
we started asking the municipal folks

673
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:40,319
questions if they are seasonally

674
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,278
Municipal Water has changed way more

675
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,798
drastically than I've seen a well water

676
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:49,079
on average because they've had to you

677
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:51,398
know what uh during the summer the uh

678
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,199
grows in the corridor of Michigan are

679
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:57,398
pulling from the lake and the water

680
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,600
temperature increases and the M the bad

681
00:28:57,398 --> 00:28:59,918
bacteria

682
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,199
because of the water temperature

683
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,200
increasing from the lake increases so

684
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,679
they have turned up the dial literally

685
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,000
variably turned up the dial and added

686
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:15,120
chloramines to try to get rid of a

687
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,200
higher bod biological or oxidative

688
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,558
demand the bad stuff they're trying to

689
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,319
kill for longer and that

690
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,200
chloramine that's what I feel is turning

691
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:27,720
into things we really don't want again

692
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,080
chlorine if done right we aren't too

693
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,798
worried about it we haven't been we've

694
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,199
been drinking that water for decades and

695
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,679
decades but chloramines to me is still

696
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,038
uh proof is not in the pudding um and I

697
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,000
want to make sure I'm getting rid of

698
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:43,038
them and asking more questions to my

699
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,720
Municipal treatment folks about their

700
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:46,038
use of chloramines so if that's the

701
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,519
takeaway it's learn if there's

702
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:49,839
chloramines being added to your

703
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,798
Municipal Water Supply and I'm not a

704
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,199
conspiracy theorist or anything I I

705
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:56,440
think we're doing everything we can very

706
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,240
appropriately it's just what if that

707
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,240
water's actually super clean and now the

708
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,798
chloramines don't have anything to to

709
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,000
get it to get rid of it right it isn't

710
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:08,079
it isn't doing its thing it's still in

711
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,679
the water supply and we've seen

712
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:14,240
chloramines come out into our irrigation

713
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,640
water um it's just something I want to

714
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,120
be sure to remove and again well you

715
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,840
might ask me about it but filtering it

716
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,719
out right off the get-go is generally a

717
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,278
very

718
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,000
inexpensive great insurance policy um

719
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,640
and everybody's pretty familiar with the

720
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,119
carbon filtration and so carbon media

721
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,840
has changed a little bit over the years

722
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,879
and we can get into that and it's become

723
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,879
much more efficient there's a question

724
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,519
like on the questionnaire are there

725
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,440
chloramines yes well then I'm I'm going

726
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,960
to make you spend a little more money on

727
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,679
a different kind of uh carbon medium

728
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,919
that's basically it it's more efficient

729
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,278
at absorbing those those

730
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,519
chloramines so I'm going to give you

731
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:57,119
my very limited knowledge on chlorine

732
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,519
and chloramine to try and simplify this

733
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,678
for folks and

734
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,038
please correct me where you can uh in

735
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,519
anything that I say we're learning from

736
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,158
each other learning from each other as

737
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,440
as it's been explained to me over the

738
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,559
years because I've been hearing about

739
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,320
chloramine for over a decade now because

740
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,720
they have it in I think Portland Oregon

741
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,480
which is not too far away from us I have

742
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,399
chlorine here and chlorine like you said

743
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,599
pretty

744
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:26,759
unstable uh chemical it reacts with

745
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:30,119
oxygen um and organic matter and the

746
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:33,398
constituent remains is is fairly safe

747
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:37,518
like you said um chloramine I thought

748
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:39,558
change to chlorine and I think ammonia

749
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,159
was what I was reading recently about it

750
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:42,638
um are sort of the constituent remains

751
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,360
of what happens when it comes it

752
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,519
complexes or comes in contact with

753
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:49,079
Organic Matter

754
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,599
biological uh microbial life something

755
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,240
like that um chlorine very stable

756
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,278
component you can't you can leave water

757
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,558
out with chlorine in it it will off gas

758
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:01,398
over time or you can bubble it to remove

759
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,398
chlorine chloramine that's not the case

760
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:05,359
you actually has to come in contact with

761
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:07,759
something biological or some sort of

762
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,439
organic matter whether that be an old

763
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,599
boots a handful of soil uh carbon

764
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,038
filtration is the simplest and easiest

765
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,839
one that's that's why you've got me

766
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,720
thinking about a carbon filter um in

767
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,119
general I don't tend to worry about

768
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,480
chlorine or chloramine relative to a lot

769
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,398
of other things it's pretty low on my

770
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,639
list uh primarily because I've always

771
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,119
been under the assumption that soil is

772
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,759
so biologically active it has such high

773
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,678
levels of organic matter I mean much

774
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,879
higher than even agricultural soils to

775
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:42,278
where what's what may potentially be

776
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,278
dying is being replaced so rapidly and

777
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:46,240
uh you know the level of chlorine is so

778
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,880
low that I I tend to be not too

779
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,599
concerned about I haven't noticed any

780
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,080
detrimental effects from watering with

781
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,240
chlorinated water but again what you're

782
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,199
bringing up I think is really

783
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,240
interesting I haven't thought about it

784
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,840
postco um I haven't had to deal with

785
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,880
chloramine

786
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:04,678
um I have heard you could use theoric

787
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,399
acid also as a good solution vitamin C

788
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,240
potentially and there's actually some

789
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,959
commercial sorbic acid products

790
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,079
specifically for removing chlorine I

791
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,319
can't remember I think it was called

792
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,599
vied Decor was a product we used back in

793
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,000
the day but

794
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:22,439
um yeah that's sort of that's sort of my

795
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,319
take on it um I I don't know how you

796
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,000
feel I assume too if I'm watering with

797
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,000
something like a Water breaker where

798
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,119
that water is in such small particulates

799
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,599
of finer droplet size as that water is

800
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,359
traveling through the air towards the

801
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,240
soil it's coming in contact with a ton

802
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,158
of oxygen um I I wonder how much

803
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,638
chlorine is really even making it in the

804
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,559
soil at that point

805
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:48,798
so yeah those are my

806
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,359
thought I I love it again we agree I'm

807
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,679
not overly worried about an

808
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,798
appropriately chlorinated municiple

809
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,278
water supply and

810
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,679
I'm asking more a lot more questions on

811
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,519
Chlor if they are adding

812
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,798
chloramine and it feels like there's

813
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,278
more flavors of chloramine then again

814
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,199
you and I will learn together and find

815
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:10,599
somebody that that knows what's what

816
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,398
because I've heard the same thing when

817
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,440
in com combination chloramines and

818
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,319
organic matter have created some really

819
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,320
nasty things it turns out so I keep sort

820
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,200
of we'll have to go down that rabbit

821
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,000
hole off offline yeah no I appreciate

822
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:28,239
that if you do find some answers please

823
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,358
reach out um okay talking about uh not

824
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,358
so great things in water a question I

825
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,398
another question I had for you was past

826
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,639
or pfas those forever chemicals that you

827
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:40,519
keep hearing

828
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,480
about I hear they're everywhere now um

829
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:44,960
what's your experience or knowledge

830
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,760
around dealing with

831
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,320
this more personal than than business in

832
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,440
terms of I haven't run up against

833
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,079
anybody that was concerned about pasas

834
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,240
in their Horticultural their irrigation

835
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,240
water or Supply but it has absolutely

836
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,879
been a topic where I am I'm sitting in

837
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:07,239
Raleigh North Carolina and we have these

838
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,200
forever chemical producing manufacturing

839
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:12,759
plants um within a couple hours drive of

840
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:15,039
me it has absolutely gotten into the

841
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,320
water supply it has been a problem for a

842
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,358
long time we keep learning more and more

843
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:24,440
about uh these nasty things that are

844
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:26,519
manufacturing you know um I forget

845
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,880
anti-flammable materials it's a lot of

846
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,838
chemistry right and they do not go

847
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,960
anywhere ever and they come into our

848
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:36,358
bodies and they stay there and they are

849
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,280
very carcinogenic um so it's been a real

850
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:43,119
mess I would be working with some

851
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,960
experts if somebody brought it as a

852
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,920
potential um contaminant in their water

853
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,760
supply I would really go somewhere quick

854
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,599
that isn't just us making our best

855
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,319
guesses in Googling I'd want to reach

856
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,039
out to people that really knew what they

857
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:01,800
were talking about my guess is it's

858
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:05,159
probably not terribly difficult to get

859
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,440
out of a water stream the problem with

860
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:10,799
these is that they have contaminated

861
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,440
aquifers and the soils Etc and when you

862
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,400
know it's just they're part of the

863
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,960
ecosystem that's that's tough like if

864
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,400
your well is

865
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,199
contaminated dig a deeper well get a

866
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:28,039
clean aquifer I I think is kind of what

867
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:30,039
the sad reality is um of me standing if

868
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,039
they're there It's just tough to

869
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,159
remediate them or get rid of them out of

870
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,599
the environment that you know once

871
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,318
they're in there they're just being

872
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,160
recycled again and again in part of our

873
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,039
water so so it would be something that I

874
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:43,239
would not mess around with in terms of

875
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,559
just assuming we could get rid of them

876
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:46,118
with our typical methods which we can

877
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,039
get rid of some really nasty things well

878
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:53,680
some pretty basic methods you mentioned

879
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:55,559
ation to get rid of a lot of chlorine um

880
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,279
you know uh there's all kinds of things

881
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,119
that we can do simply but the are a

882
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,960
different beast and that's why you are

883
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,559
appropriately uh hyper sensitive to them

884
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,960
yeah let's jump into filtration really

885
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,559
quick then so can you touch on sort of

886
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,838
what removes what

887
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:19,000
like obviously R is you know reverse

888
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:21,838
osmosis is sort of like the best the the

889
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,159
top-of-the-line option for removal no

890
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,358
you're saying no I'm learning okay it's

891
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:30,239
it's in my head it's don't call it the

892
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,239
best well has it has downsides for sure

893
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,118
right right right it's going to get rid

894
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,959
of a lot most

895
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,599
everything whether you want it to or not

896
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,159
yeah so it's we don't just throw r o at

897
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,720
a cannabis we will have man okay first

898
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:50,480
give me R why do you think you need Ro

899
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:53,239
right well just that's what you do in

900
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,960
cannabis we grow with rro could we have

901
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,838
a discussion about that so we've become

902
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,679
very aware that it's just it's not

903
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,440
something that should just automatically

904
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,719
be part of hey I'm going to spend some

905
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,960
real money on my facility or on my grow

906
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,759
R that's that's been the case and we've

907
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,679
seen it not just cannabis production but

908
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,160
in other sort of especially in indoor

909
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,480
growing let's just take whatever water

910
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:17,239
it is no matter how good or bad it is

911
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,119
and we're gonna R it well let's just

912
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:24,879
talk about that R is absolutely um a

913
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,318
really good tool at removing everything

914
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,200
and starting from zero why would we do

915
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:33,199
that in our industry if then we're going

916
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:35,118
to add ppms back into it well what if

917
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,000
all those ppms were most of them were

918
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,599
fine and you're stripping them all out

919
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,039
and now you're paying to add them back

920
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,480
in in the form of EC right and getting

921
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,159
our parts per million back up well why

922
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,679
would we do that right so that's we just

923
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,719
question we use Ro for salts high

924
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:53,879
chlorides high bicarbonates like these

925
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:57,679
things you can't filter out so to speak

926
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:01,079
you do have to use an RO membrane and Ro

927
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:04,279
to remove or reduce salts so that's our

928
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,000
stance is it is absolutely necessary

929
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,760
when it is necessary right and can we

930
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:15,318
blend back can we blend back this crop

931
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,560
and I'm growing um in soil beds in a

932
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:20,759
living soil I'm an organic grower I just

933
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:24,119
want to start with high quality water uh

934
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,160
great then you can talk us into using

935
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,039
more and more pure permeate right so Ro

936
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:33,118
makes permeate and then it makes the

937
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,880
reject water we can add we can blend

938
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,119
back in all of our systems have the

939
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,838
ability whether you think you're going

940
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,800
to need it or not to blend back in the

941
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:45,199
untreated maybe it's been carbon

942
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,160
filtered and then not

943
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,559
softened but so I'm blending my carbon

944
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:54,679
filtered water that hasn't gone through

945
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:58,078
the r back in with my RO permeate at 0

946
00:39:54,679 --> 00:40:00,199
to 50% more that Ro machine starts

947
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,079
paying for itself a lot more if we don't

948
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,439
have to use Ro permeate so it's rare

949
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,160
that we're going to recommend Ro

950
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,400
permeate be used it could be very

951
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:12,559
aggressive water it can pull nutrients

952
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,800
out it's trying to make itself whole so

953
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,119
there's lots of bad things about a pure

954
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,720
AR permeate especially in young young

955
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,400
crops that are trying you know with

956
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,598
super small root systems and fine hairs

957
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,318
it can be really take it could slow

958
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,920
things down just like that cold water

959
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:30,679
scenario I mentioned so so so irrigation

960
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,280
with pure R permeate you really got to

961
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:35,879
know what you're doing

962
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,359
um again it's just trying to make your

963
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,720
whole so that's that's R is the extreme

964
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:44,078
right so yeah talk about

965
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,358
normal yeah so the original question I

966
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,480
was I wanted to ask you though was like

967
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:50,519
what so what does like for example a

968
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,400
simple carbon filter not

969
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:56,239
remove yep simple carbon filter cannot

970
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,119
remove salts okay right I don't care how

971
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:01,318
fancy I there's catalytic activated

972
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,559
carbon and now catalytic carbon two

973
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,880
Medias that are our go-to Medias um

974
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,039
catalytic is just a little more

975
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,920
efficient it's a little more expensive a

976
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,279
little more efficient removing

977
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,119
chloramines um it's just stickier

978
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,119
they're stickier sponges um essentially

979
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,960
but they cannot remove salts that's its

980
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,720
biggest thing it can remove a lot of

981
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,358
things it can absorb some levels of

982
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,279
heavy metals but if you have heavy

983
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,199
metals it's typically not the the only

984
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,480
filter we're going to look at if you

985
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:36,159
know man I've got high levels of boron

986
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:39,358
barium um nickel these things some of it

987
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,838
could be absorbed by accident on purpose

988
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,759
but then we really need to make sure we

989
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:45,920
look at levels um and there again

990
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,400
certain heavy metals we can't so Les can

991
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,519
you clarify when you say salts that

992
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,960
you're not just talking about sodium for

993
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,559
folks that are listening in case they're

994
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,440
not familiar with the sort of the

995
00:41:53,559 --> 00:42:00,960
broader chemical salt term yeah salt can

996
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,639
mean uh a lot of things and when when in

997
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,599
the nursery and horiculture we ask are

998
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,358
you a synthetic grower you're growing

999
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,039
with salts right I mean salts are

1000
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,880
chlorides potassiums um manganese these

1001
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,400
are all types of salts and we can't take

1002
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:21,400
those out with carbon filters if you

1003
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:25,920
have way high levels of salts um or your

1004
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:29,639
water is hard sodium bicarbonate right

1005
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,920
um these are things we need to be aware

1006
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:37,159
of and that's when we start looking at a

1007
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,559
salt removal machine reverse osmosis

1008
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:43,759
ultra fine filtration but really to

1009
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:47,319
remove soluble salts which again right

1010
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,359
not just sodium um but all a whole strip

1011
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:53,079
of the of the Periodic Chart are

1012
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,078
essentially we call them salts and

1013
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,280
they're easily they become soluble in

1014
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,119
water um and we can

1015
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,760
physically get rid of them we have to do

1016
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:06,800
special things uh to remove salts so

1017
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,599
what what would something like an ozone

1018
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,880
machine be used for if we're talking

1019
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:15,440
about filtration not a filter yeah ozone

1020
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,119
ozone is like uh it's an oxidizer

1021
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,280
disinfectant right so chlorine dioxide

1022
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,880
hydrogen

1023
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,640
peroxide um oxidizers we are using to

1024
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,240
disinfect the water um and so ozone not

1025
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,879
necessarily a filter it does almost

1026
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:35,078
always require some thought about

1027
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,160
prefiltration and postfiltration if

1028
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,839
we're using ozone as a disinfectant uh

1029
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:43,480
ozone super efficient uh again if you go

1030
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,279
to the webinar I get into it a little

1031
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,240
bit but it's a really efficient way if

1032
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,400
we needed it its use for

1033
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:55,000
disinfecting and for precipitating out

1034
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Metals so it's really powerful and can

1035
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,159
we can we can get rid of ir IRS we can

1036
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,519
get rid of these other if we have high

1037
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,159
levels of metals again at the Periodic

1038
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:08,119
Chart we've got Metals metal halides can

1039
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:10,318
we precipitate those out is we'd hate to

1040
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,119
have to inject a ton of chlorine which

1041
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,079
is a way we would do so with small

1042
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,079
levels of

1043
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:20,920
iron ozone is so powerful and is so

1044
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:25,160
reactive we can we can harness its

1045
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,639
powerful oxid oxidizing power to

1046
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,639
precipitate out MET

1047
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:33,039
so that's so you get like iron is that

1048
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:35,318
what you're saying we're removing the

1049
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,079
iron precipitating it out and then we

1050
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:39,880
have to filter it out otherwise we're

1051
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,960
going to have you know its its

1052
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,640
precipitate clog up anyway but at least

1053
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,159
the iron we get it out of solution so

1054
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,078
you either use there's there's multiple

1055
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:50,799
ways of removing high iron which is a

1056
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,640
problem all around the country with

1057
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,280
Wells um and we we've always seen that

1058
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,358
some of us have the orange stain uh in

1059
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,000
our wellwater that's iron typically

1060
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:03,159
soluble iron and we're trying to Des

1061
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,559
solubilize it and capture it we have to

1062
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:07,480
filter that out though but ozone not

1063
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:09,640
necessarily A filter but it can be part

1064
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,079
of a filtration system if that makes

1065
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:17,400
sense great are there any other major

1066
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:18,960
ways of filtering water or I guess I I

1067
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,358
guess we touched on disinfecting with

1068
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:26,119
ozone but um besides carbon and

1069
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:29,519
Ro I like to break it into my simple

1070
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:30,880
brain into to there's sort of there's

1071
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,159
mechanical

1072
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,480
filtration if I have particulate if I

1073
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,879
have things floating in the water that

1074
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,199
is a very different kind of filter than

1075
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,200
if I'm trying to remove some chemistry

1076
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,000
right out of the water and by chemistry

1077
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,159
we've talked about chlorine chloramines

1078
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,239
salts right that's part of the water

1079
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,838
chemistry and I'm trying to alter or

1080
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,439
remove things that are too high of a

1081
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,519
level so there's those kinds of fil that

1082
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,639
can do that carbon filtration happens to

1083
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,318
have those properties of being able to

1084
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:05,960
change the sort of chemistry of the

1085
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:09,400
water well if I just trying to remove

1086
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,519
silt out of a well that's just got silty

1087
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,639
water that clogs up my my micro

1088
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,759
irrigation or just it just really

1089
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:18,118
becomes a hindrance and it's um you know

1090
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,640
I'm trying to remove physical

1091
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,480
particulates that's a whole different

1092
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:26,118
set of filters and boy are there a lot

1093
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,079
of those screen filters media filters

1094
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,039
you know sand filters are an old school

1095
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,640
media filter so there's just all kinds

1096
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:34,159
of things I just sort of sometimes

1097
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,358
there's they're one and the same a well

1098
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,399
can have high high it smells like rotten

1099
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,199
eggs it's got high hydrogen sulfide I

1100
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,160
need to remove that and it's got silt

1101
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,838
great well I need a physical filter and

1102
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,000
then I need a sort of a chemical filter

1103
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:51,960
type system to change the water on two

1104
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,760
different levels if that makes sense so

1105
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,800
physical filtration in my mind and sort

1106
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,079
of more of a chemical altering or remov

1107
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,960
filtration

1108
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:05,119
systems yeah so so jumping back to

1109
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,639
straight R water um and you brought up a

1110
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,400
great Point like people should

1111
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:12,719
absolutely test their water uh don't

1112
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,039
assume that you need R Ro is not ideal

1113
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:18,118
uh I've always heard R referred to as

1114
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:21,800
hungry water because it wants to bond

1115
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:24,559
with various uh minerals and things and

1116
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,800
so when you add it to your soil or when

1117
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,240
it goes through a pump

1118
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,839
system like you said it could pick up

1119
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,479
things that we may not want to be adding

1120
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,078
to our water and I think that's a good

1121
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,719
story on heavy metals that we'll share

1122
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,599
that you shared with me that let's get

1123
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,118
to here in a minute but uh the the quick

1124
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,318
question I had uh because you already

1125
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,079
answered the question of why not do use

1126
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:48,079
straight Ro but what's a good Target PPM

1127
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:51,280
just broadly possibly that a folks

1128
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:56,000
listening could aim for if they did need

1129
00:47:51,280 --> 00:48:00,280
to use r o that's a terrible question

1130
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,400
Ted because where did you start because

1131
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:07,079
if you started at an EC of 2.0 right and

1132
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,480
and I'm an EC guy and you're you know

1133
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:13,960
tell me where your PPM is you're trying

1134
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:16,000
to hit what ppms are you trying to hit

1135
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,519
give me in a vegetative state walk me

1136
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,239
through the ppms your averages that you

1137
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:25,079
like to see that your your crop enjoys

1138
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:27,159
give me those ranges so they're fresh in

1139
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:28,920
my mind and then I I have to go and I

1140
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:31,679
would use a calculator right because you

1141
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,559
guys start come to us ppms and we talk

1142
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,318
about the makeup of an EC and then we

1143
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,599
then we start parsing that out so if you

1144
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:42,880
know I know that an EC of one to two is

1145
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:45,280
a heavy feed and you go more than that

1146
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,599
you know what I mean in terms of that

1147
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,079
and that 500 PPM is that well so you're

1148
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,680
okay so you're approaching this from the

1149
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:58,480
perspective of I'm fertig gating and I'm

1150
00:48:53,679 --> 00:49:00,879
maintaining my mineral my My overall

1151
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,719
plant fertility

1152
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,559
through through chemical fertilizers and

1153
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:08,358
and continually adding that level of

1154
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,480
small levels of fertility throughout the

1155
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:13,000
plant's life I'm coming at it and keep

1156
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,159
in mind we get all types listening this

1157
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,239
podcast but I'm thinking of it like the

1158
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:19,960
majority of my fertility is already in

1159
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:23,318
my soil because I'm an organic living

1160
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,400
soil guy and so for me I'm I'm I'm I'm

1161
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:29,599
looking at the water purely for

1162
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:33,240
irrigation purposes yes and so my

1163
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:38,079
my my question back at you

1164
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:40,039
is is are any ppms needed I'd hate to

1165
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,079
say that RO water isn't going to hurt

1166
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:46,079
your crop that has all the PPM it needs

1167
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,920
in the soil in your amendments in that

1168
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,720
crop so I guess I'm throwing the

1169
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,000
question back at you to teach

1170
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:56,159
me what is the PPM makeup what is it

1171
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,519
made of because if it's harmful or

1172
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,920
adding salts and or you know something

1173
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:02,960
that if we're trying to cut the water if

1174
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:06,318
I'm coming in with too high PPM you're

1175
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:09,199
asking the question where where is that

1176
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:12,159
level I honestly don't I can't answer

1177
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,960
that as an average because you could

1178
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,639
have a

1179
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,920
hotter mix because you like to do it

1180
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:20,078
this way I think again you're teaching

1181
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,079
me on the Organics and living soil side

1182
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,798
of things and I'm saying it might be

1183
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:27,200
very different for somebody who's just

1184
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:28,838
really trying to um

1185
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,798
I mean generally we're most all trying

1186
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:34,960
to create the same kind of product right

1187
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:37,838
um and do it within that same time frame

1188
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,039
of this plant that is an annual in terms

1189
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:43,558
of cannabis but I don't want to answer

1190
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:45,960
it if somebody's growing um uh you know

1191
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,400
not cannabis or not Tomatoes or not

1192
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,519
something that's fruiting or if it's a

1193
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,280
longer term crop or we have customers

1194
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,920
that are growing Cactus and propagating

1195
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,880
Cactus and I'd be like man we there air

1196
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,559
plants that are tons of folks that are

1197
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,680
you know production small medium and

1198
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,720
large of airplants where we get closer

1199
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:05,358
and closer to zero PPM required needed

1200
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:08,519
it does it cannot handle high levels at

1201
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:11,440
all if it's a if it's an air style verm

1202
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:13,880
milads orchids right so it's hard for me

1203
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,519
I'm trying to wear your hat but then the

1204
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,680
Hat of 99 different other crops but yes

1205
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:22,880
in your world I

1206
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,879
think to to to start with the water and

1207
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,760
look at the PPM of your Municipal let's

1208
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,880
just say a municipal Source coming into

1209
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,680
house and then you're gardening with

1210
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,838
that Municipal Water I want to take a

1211
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:36,798
look at it and go are those ppms okay

1212
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:37,838
for you it looks like you guys have

1213
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:41,239
pretty

1214
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:44,000
even uh the PPM makeup because what

1215
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:46,919
makes up PPM is a it's like a soup I

1216
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,880
could have added the soup is got the PPM

1217
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,920
but my soup's got I've got a chicken

1218
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,720
stock base my wife's got the vegan thing

1219
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,280
going on over here and our ppms are

1220
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,318
exactly the same but they're completely

1221
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,798
made up differently so I'd be afraid to

1222
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,400
add mine onto a certain kind of soil mix

1223
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:06,358
does that make sense I'm not smart

1224
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,400
enough to know no it does start you're

1225
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm trying to simplify the question and

1226
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,599
you're telling me it's too complicated

1227
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,559
so you're saying like if if we get the

1228
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:18,838
soil or the water sorry if we get the

1229
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:21,559
water down to 50 PPM but that 50 PPM is

1230
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:24,960
all sodium it may still be a problem if

1231
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:26,880
that PPM is like calcium right then we

1232
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,119
just need to account for that and it's

1233
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,798
perfectly fine in our over our fertility

1234
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,480
plan so absolutely thank you that is

1235
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:36,039
what I'm trying to get to because we see

1236
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,519
people take out good things and add it

1237
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:40,519
back in we see people very appropriately

1238
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,039
on purpose by accident take out the bad

1239
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:43,719
things and then add their good things

1240
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:46,838
back in we just need to start so that

1241
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:49,000
PPM is a soup in my brain of could be

1242
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:52,719
anything it's like man well it's free

1243
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,639
calcium put a 100 like what's going to

1244
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:56,759
not harm your crop obviously we don't

1245
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:59,279
want to have anything become toxic level

1246
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,400
and build up over our our life cycle our

1247
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,960
crop um you know again or if we're

1248
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:08,000
growing trees or nurseries wow we've got

1249
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,400
to be really cognizant of a 50-year crop

1250
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,199
if you can imagine we have customers

1251
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,358
that they're growing Nursery stock

1252
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:17,239
that's years um so so maybe a better

1253
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,920
question or approach then would be to

1254
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:23,879
say okay let's let's set targets for all

1255
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:27,358
of these Bad actors whether that's

1256
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,960
chlorides bicarbonates sodium and say

1257
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,880
when we hit that threshold let's say we

1258
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,880
don't want to see more than I'm going to

1259
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:38,119
make up a number here 5 PPM of sodium

1260
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,760
overall in that RO water or in our

1261
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:43,079
remineralized water before before at

1262
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,920
that point we don't have to take action

1263
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,039
and we can feel comfortable using it as

1264
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:51,760
as our irrigation water but if that 50

1265
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:55,358
PPM of total

1266
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,160
uh is as a total in my water is is

1267
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,318
entirely comprised of sodium then that

1268
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:03,358
may put us above our Target threshold

1269
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:05,400
and we'd have problems still but why is

1270
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,880
it so important that we remineralize

1271
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,838
water in this scenario because I do know

1272
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,039
of Growers that water was straight rro

1273
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,159
in living soil systems like you said it

1274
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:16,960
is more buffering we do we don't see as

1275
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:20,679
many issues but I feel like it's

1276
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,720
suboptimal for all the re it is too I I

1277
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:25,440
do too and I don't want to be completely

1278
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:28,078
anecdotal or feel that way but it does

1279
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,039
it is a hungry water the chemistry is

1280
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,318
the chemistry it is trying to make

1281
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:34,719
itself whole um and it is very

1282
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:38,440
aggressive meaning it's going to pull

1283
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:40,759
and make it it it it grab and break

1284
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:44,679
apart certain things that you might not

1285
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,720
want broken apart in terms of bonds um I

1286
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:49,399
don't think it's um you know pure

1287
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:51,078
permeate would be an interesting

1288
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,680
experiment to really take a look at it

1289
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:57,720
in terms of uh beneficial I don't I I

1290
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:00,838
don't think its properties would behoove

1291
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:04,519
the the life cycle of an nematode right

1292
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:06,000
I I can't imagine it it increasing their

1293
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:08,519
life cycle I don't I feel like it would

1294
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,559
be harmful I'm now just sort of coming

1295
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:13,318
up with things that we use and we make

1296
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,000
sure that we have an appropriate media

1297
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:18,400
um you know and based on on the media

1298
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,760
type or right if we keep depending on if

1299
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,798
we're talking um from Hydroponics all

1300
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,640
the way to where you what you do and the

1301
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:30,559
organic side of things I think R

1302
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:33,000
obviously becomes it becomes nearly

1303
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,920
impossible to work within Hydroponics if

1304
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,719
if we do a lot of lettuce Bath Systems

1305
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,440
like acres and Acres of floating lettuce

1306
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:42,519
Bath Systems 41 to 50 days crop Cycles

1307
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,679
from seedlings to harvest at the other

1308
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:46,519
end of a big long greenhouse on these

1309
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:48,679
you know really neat production

1310
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:50,480
facilities and that is a we have to

1311
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,798
really be careful there's enough water

1312
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,079
there we do have some buffer in the

1313
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:57,079
water but it's purely hydroponic so

1314
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,599
any change right we're on the razor's

1315
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,599
Edge in pure pure Hydroponics and I

1316
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,838
think you get away with a lot more very

1317
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:08,039
positively in living soil and organic

1318
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:12,519
because you have such a proliferation of

1319
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:14,119
all the beneficials increasing the the

1320
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:16,679
uh the health of the crop and really

1321
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:18,358
just becoming very powerful and watching

1322
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:21,318
out for the root system when you when

1323
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:24,199
you have the living soil so it's a lot

1324
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:25,639
to talk about so much going on that

1325
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:27,919
that's actually a really good transition

1326
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:30,558
because you mentioned how we have much

1327
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,200
better buffering capacity in living

1328
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,760
soils than with these other forms of of

1329
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:37,439
growing

1330
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,520
um

1331
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:44,920
yet I I still believe that the pH of my

1332
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:47,679
water can matter it doesn't always

1333
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,000
matter you know but it can matter

1334
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,919
specifically around this idea of

1335
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,639
alkalinity and hardness so

1336
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:58,358
if which which relates to and again

1337
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:01,480
correct me I relates to the ability of

1338
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:04,480
the of of the water to change that pH so

1339
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:07,798
the the buffering capacity of that water

1340
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,679
um or ability your ability to change the

1341
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:14,038
pH of that water and so if your water

1342
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:18,078
has a very high EC if it has

1343
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:20,359
um a lot of alkalinity it could impact

1344
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,039
the pH of your media and yes these

1345
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:24,838
microbes and the rizosphere interactions

1346
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:28,039
there absolutely play a role in in

1347
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:30,519
buffering that and and

1348
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:32,039
transitioning it into a form into a PH

1349
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:34,798
range that's going to be more optimal

1350
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,760
for the plant but my perspective has

1351
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:40,480
always been if we water with water

1352
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:42,319
that's been properly phed um and you

1353
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,280
know assuming that the alkalinity is

1354
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,000
high and we need to adjust the pH if

1355
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,599
it's low you know rainwater something

1356
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,239
like that even if it's eight8 you know

1357
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:54,039
82 I'm not that worried about it because

1358
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:57,558
that pH can swing same with ro low PPM

1359
00:57:54,039 --> 00:58:00,839
RO water I don't worry about pH

1360
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:04,160
but if we can make water that is high in

1361
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:06,798
alkalinity into a better PH range I I

1362
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,440
would assume that that would allow the

1363
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,838
plant to put its energy and those

1364
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,400
microbes in its energy into a more

1365
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:15,798
efficient plant processes that would

1366
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,760
increase its health and growth what are

1367
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:21,838
your thoughts around that yes yes it is

1368
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,520
it is it is easier to talk about in a

1369
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:26,318
soilless environment because water

1370
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:29,119
chemistry is everything right the water

1371
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:32,279
that's it and and like you just said if

1372
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:35,400
we are if we have zero buffer zero

1373
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:37,599
alkalinity things change immediately

1374
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,880
right and titration is how we test it

1375
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:43,280
and I can barely remember but you you

1376
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,880
keep dropping drops into this water and

1377
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,200
nothing's changing nothing's changing

1378
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:51,079
nothing's changing and then one the next

1379
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:53,838
droplet everything shifted right you got

1380
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:56,960
to the top and then it just plummeted

1381
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:58,719
right so it's just an interesting uh

1382
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,519
experiment in how

1383
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:04,279
quickly a

1384
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:06,480
non buffered water environment can

1385
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,798
change and that's we call it the razor's

1386
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,079
Edge right if you're trying to steer a

1387
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:14,318
crop uh if you're trying to

1388
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,480
utilize zero alkalinity water pure arop

1389
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,279
perate right it's got you've removed

1390
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,318
you've stripped everything and now you

1391
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:23,880
it's it's it changes really quickly uh

1392
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:26,719
depending it's can be very frustrating

1393
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:29,760
the buffer your envir you you provided

1394
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:32,558
in the media in the soil in the organic

1395
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,960
soil is absolutely going to be less

1396
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:39,720
dependent a lot less dependent uh on

1397
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,639
hitting that pH just right right the if

1398
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:43,838
we're completely salt-based grower

1399
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:47,598
synthetics nonorganic you know

1400
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:50,599
production facility that pH 5.8 to 6.0

1401
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,039
and I mean we want 5.85 we want five

1402
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:55,359
what do you want what does this crop

1403
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:59,240
like the hydrangea in that PE media

1404
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:03,038
versus I mean it's just you know exactly

1405
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:07,199
we've dialed that in we are hitting that

1406
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:12,000
in your I it's just a way happier easier

1407
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:15,919
window of pH to be applied to I can't

1408
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,599
imagine it's really rare a water source

1409
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,798
well and certainly Municipal that come

1410
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:22,880
that would come out with a pH that you'd

1411
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:26,639
have to be concerned about if you knew

1412
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,640
what you were doing on the organic soils

1413
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:33,159
growing um right I I think you're 100%

1414
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:34,920
correct now we have to watch what again

1415
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:37,118
what are the ppms made out of what is

1416
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,559
that alkalinity is it high is are we

1417
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:41,640
accumulating too many salts because of

1418
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:44,920
that Municipal Water or that well water

1419
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:47,759
did have a high iron we have seen iron

1420
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:49,159
levels really detrimental and we have to

1421
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,319
do something about it the rest of the

1422
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:56,519
water absolutely perfect but 15 parts

1423
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:58,920
per million iron I mean

1424
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,920
this is crazy it really affects

1425
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,559
different things that you know I again

1426
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,519
you're having to there's a lot of things

1427
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:08,119
that if you're getting your your media

1428
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:10,280
made for you based on your water

1429
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:12,599
chemistry that's a thing right for

1430
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,319
larger production facilities their media

1431
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:17,559
is being made for them based on my

1432
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:19,239
wellwater source which is that's a neat

1433
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:22,480
we're matching oh my well water's got

1434
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:25,318
this so make me a blend that complement

1435
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,960
that yeah but an organ right but in an

1436
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:29,960
organic I

1437
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,519
mean a wonderfully living soil organic

1438
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,199
water only

1439
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:37,119
media I I think we get away with a lot

1440
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:39,960
more meaning it's a lot easier to do

1441
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,160
with various water chemistries so I

1442
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:46,000
think that's super appropriate and a

1443
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:48,519
really really wonderful way to to grow

1444
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,920
basically yeah and all that being said

1445
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:55,000
though I would I would still uh I would

1446
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,200
still state that I I believe pH of the

1447
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,440
water does matter and it's something

1448
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,798
that we should be paying attention to on

1449
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,519
the water test but what you brought up

1450
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:06,639
was a good point is what's creating that

1451
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:08,759
pH is really the key to a lot of that a

1452
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,480
lot of what we're looking at exactly

1453
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,039
yeah you you have to know what's in your

1454
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,199
pH if you're injecting anything even

1455
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,880
Organics um if you're putting an

1456
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:20,159
additive uh for that last couple of

1457
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,400
weeks uh a flour you know if you're

1458
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:26,239
putting something extra in it that pH if

1459
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:28,318
it's if it's acidic or if it's um non-

1460
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,318
acidic if it's neutral how does it

1461
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,400
affect whatever you're adding because pH

1462
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:35,558
will make things more or less available

1463
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,400
and could alter their form and you asked

1464
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:40,160
about acids and types of acid right

1465
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,599
citric acid for organic growing that's

1466
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,639
my next question for you yeah I I

1467
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,119
thought it was a simple question asking

1468
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:50,960
you what are the your favorite or best

1469
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:53,278
uh pH adjusters and you looked at me and

1470
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,519
like that was a huge question so let's

1471
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:58,559
talk about if I if I gave you an answer

1472
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:01,880
then thousand colleagues would be like

1473
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,680
what you I mean everybody has their own

1474
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,640
preference organic Growers are sort of

1475
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:09,278
stuck with the citric acid I think is

1476
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:11,639
one of the only is there anything else

1477
01:03:09,278 --> 01:03:14,400
out there you know it's a super weak

1478
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:17,558
acid that sort of dissipates quickly

1479
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,358
it's tough um to utilize on large

1480
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:21,200
production facilities we found this out

1481
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,440
firsthand from our large cannabis

1482
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:26,118
Growers that we're using citric acid I

1483
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:30,200
mean so it's a wonderful discussion um

1484
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:31,440
if we are in pure big scale commercial

1485
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:35,759
uh horiculture

1486
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:38,760
it's bu it as most cost efficient to get

1487
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,640
to your doorstep as you possibly can and

1488
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:44,440
that is typically unfortunately as high

1489
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:47,639
a percentage of phosphoric or sulfuric

1490
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:51,119
acid as you is legal to purchase you

1491
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:56,239
know 400 Gall 270 gallon totes or is a

1492
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:58,798
400 gallon totes of as high percentage

1493
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:02,558
costic danger you know like it's it's

1494
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:04,838
it's a shame right but so depending on

1495
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,839
what you're trying to do it can be a

1496
01:04:04,838 --> 01:04:11,000
very expensive input for facilities if

1497
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:15,159
they were trying to use a weak acid to

1498
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:18,358
take 8.0 to 5.8 at 1,000 gallons a

1499
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:20,920
minute is you've got to start with the

1500
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:24,278
most concentrated acid so those are the

1501
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:27,760
two complete extremes are are the citric

1502
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:30,880
acid uh and and its strength and

1503
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,400
compared to a you know High sulfuric or

1504
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,838
phosphoric

1505
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,160
Etc and one other factor for folks to

1506
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:38,920
consider is that all of these can

1507
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:40,239
potentially bring in heavy metals as

1508
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:45,200
well so you need to make sure you have a

1509
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:49,000
clean Source um and citric is just gets

1510
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:52,000
very expensive on scale um and it's not

1511
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,838
going to hold your pH for very long in

1512
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,079
in a

1513
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:58,038
reservoir correct it is it is pH just

1514
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:00,599
waiting to happen you've got to use that

1515
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:03,119
water quickly you can't make up too much

1516
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,519
of a batch you've got to make it use it

1517
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,358
uh make it use it make it use it and and

1518
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,920
and and still test it when it's coming

1519
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,838
out of your dripper or your hose uh just

1520
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,599
to make sure because we're going if if

1521
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:17,000
you've crept in the in that wrong

1522
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,720
direction and we're applying 8.0 pH

1523
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,480
water to like you were saying it does

1524
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:23,358
matter and it's certainly going to

1525
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,079
affect things over the life cycle of a

1526
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:26,639
crop and the younger the crop I like to

1527
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:29,278
think the more susceptible to root

1528
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:32,278
systems before it's matched right before

1529
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:34,480
we've matched the root Zone Mass with

1530
01:05:32,278 --> 01:05:36,358
the production we're trying to do it's

1531
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,960
critical it's more critical the younger

1532
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:42,519
the crop is when we first got our small

1533
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,000
little transplants or um we've really

1534
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:46,239
got to pay attention to it because it

1535
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,039
just that plant hasn't reached its its

1536
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:53,239
full efficiency yet down

1537
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:55,680
there well let's talk about heavy metals

1538
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:59,318
um we we talked a little bit off aab

1539
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:01,798
about this I am going to share with you

1540
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:04,318
my experience and story and then I was

1541
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:06,480
hoping you could kind of expand on that

1542
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:09,278
so I have a I have a good friend who's

1543
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,318
growing Medical in a in a state where

1544
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:14,440
they also have wreck he decided to test

1545
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:17,000
his product to see if it would would

1546
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,240
pass his flower and he found it came

1547
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,760
back uh high in Arsenic so it would have

1548
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:23,479
actually potentially failed for arsenic

1549
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,278
and he's growing in living soils he's

1550
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:29,119
reusing his media he's in beds

1551
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:30,719
um a and so he was sharing this data

1552
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,680
with me and he was looking at it and he

1553
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:36,798
was using things like soft rock phosphat

1554
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:38,480
kelp meal um but being very conscious of

1555
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,679
that and being that he's an engineer he

1556
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,000
was looking at how much you know what

1557
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:47,118
ppms of arsenic specifically was that

1558
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
adding to his overall load his soil and

1559
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:52,440
what he basically the long story short

1560
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,318
was he found that relative to his water

1561
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,720
source which I think um first of all he

1562
01:06:55,318 --> 01:07:00,440
had get it tested to a lower detection

1563
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:03,199
limit because his original test wasn't

1564
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:06,559
low enough um and this is municipal

1565
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:08,639
water that is perfectly safe to drink by

1566
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,839
EPA standards you know you're drinking

1567
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,679
whatever that is a gallon or two a day

1568
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:16,679
totally safe levels of arsenic but he

1569
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:19,879
was putting 40,000 gallons of that water

1570
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:24,399
through his grow room in a given cycle

1571
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:27,079
and uh that2 PPM of arsenic let's say

1572
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,278
you know very safe levels was building

1573
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:34,680
up in the soil over time and actually

1574
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,679
contributing potentially way

1575
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,160
more

1576
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:44,480
um sorry someone was logging into my

1577
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:48,558
zoom account I'll cut this part out

1578
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,400
uh that that level of uh the level of

1579
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,440
heavy metals in that water that level of

1580
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:56,440
arsenic was actually contributing way

1581
01:07:52,440 --> 01:08:01,599
more to the overall uh amount of arsenic

1582
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:03,760
being added to his soil then the soft

1583
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,838
rock phosphate or the kelp meal uh

1584
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:10,119
became rather insignificant from an

1585
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:12,558
arsenic load and he tested this by

1586
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:15,440
testing his flower every cycle and he

1587
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:17,359
set up an AR filter and he found that

1588
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,880
the next cycle his arsenic levels had

1589
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:22,640
dropped in his final flower so he was

1590
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,759
assuming this was working and then his

1591
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,960
next test the levels went up and he was

1592
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:27,679
totally stumped

1593
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,480
he came back to me he's like oh my whole

1594
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:33,319
theory is not working I I cannot figure

1595
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:35,158
this out well two months later he

1596
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:38,039
reaches out and tells me that he found

1597
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:40,679
out his plumber had put the filter in

1598
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:42,798
backwards and then when he fixed the

1599
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:46,079
filter he just flushed everything that

1600
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:47,679
was on the filters through into the beds

1601
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:49,759
um so essentially all that arsenic went

1602
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,399
right into the beds anyway it sounds

1603
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:55,640
like and he was right back where he was

1604
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:58,198
um fast forward another year so if few

1605
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:01,400
more cycles and he's seeing levels

1606
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:02,919
significantly lowering every cycle in

1607
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:05,920
terms of the amount of arsenic in his

1608
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:08,880
flowers so it does seem to be working

1609
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,920
it's this idea of of can we reduce the

1610
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,199
amount of overall heavy metals coming in

1611
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,239
to a to a rate that's lower than what's

1612
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:17,838
going out in the plant this you know

1613
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:21,399
hyper accumulator in the case of

1614
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:23,880
cannabis um and I guess my big takeaway

1615
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:25,759
is that water is actually probably our

1616
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,119
one of our biggest contributors of heavy

1617
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:30,920
metals and we have to look at it at a

1618
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:33,679
very low detection limit

1619
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:36,319
potentially much lower than what would

1620
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:39,000
be much lower for agricultural use than

1621
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:41,679
what would be safe for uh drinking use

1622
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,439
as humans what are your thoughts on all

1623
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,199
of

1624
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:47,719
that all of that is a perfect story and

1625
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:50,358
all of that represents what we have run

1626
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:53,520
across multiple times over the last few

1627
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:57,120
years and and cannabis Growers have

1628
01:09:53,520 --> 01:10:00,679
really taught us because of its hyper

1629
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,920
accumulation um and testing the flower

1630
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:06,239
is the end all Beall it's been

1631
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:09,800
fascinating for us to watch how the

1632
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:11,718
smallest parts per million comp like you

1633
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,960
said I mean it's just it's exactly this

1634
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:15,480
story over and again over and over again

1635
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,880
it's all a question of where did it come

1636
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:19,919
from and how do I control it so your

1637
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,199
your friend's story is perfect and it

1638
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,000
was coming in on the water source and he

1639
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:26,119
just accumulated too many ounces or

1640
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,319
pounds

1641
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:32,640
over the crop cycle especially in that

1642
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:35,960
soil bed that you reuse incredibly

1643
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,079
important to make sure we are watching

1644
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:41,279
what our soup is made out of right even

1645
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:44,000
if it's completely safe to eat the soup

1646
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:46,119
if I keep pouring soup you know it's

1647
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,679
going to just those and and then the

1648
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:51,119
water just imagine the water evapor

1649
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:53,199
transpiration right it we're going to

1650
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,719
accumulate what all of those things that

1651
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,879
were in the soup but the soup was fine

1652
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,359
to drink but gallon after gallon of soup

1653
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,400
and we're going to just left with this

1654
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:02,839
pile of who knows what what is it made

1655
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:05,439
out of so that's that water test is

1656
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,719
you've got to make sure I mentioned in a

1657
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:11,799
followup to your story of some of the

1658
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:13,640
highest level best Growers um that were

1659
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,880
and again I'm not don't mean to poo poo

1660
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,520
R permeate and to grow with pure

1661
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,440
permeate again just really got to know

1662
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:23,920
what you're doing but it is this hungry

1663
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:27,639
aggressive water failed his first flower

1664
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:31,880
test in a State and it was I believe

1665
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:35,480
barium what barium heavy metal right H

1666
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:38,400
how on Earth zero barium in the original

1667
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:41,079
water source it had been stripping off

1668
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:44,519
the arop permeate had been stripping off

1669
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:47,880
a I think it was a chromal coating of

1670
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:50,679
old pump impellers so the the pumping

1671
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,560
mechanisms uh and this R permeate had

1672
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:57,679
pulled this stuff heavy metals out of

1673
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,600
the pump and it had accumulated so well

1674
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,239
in this super efficient hyper

1675
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,639
accumulating cannabis plant that he

1676
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:05,879
failed we figured that out the Hardway

1677
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:08,440
but it all worked out bought new pumps

1678
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,159
with appropriate you know everything uh

1679
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:12,119
and no problem and so it's just where

1680
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:14,119
did it come from so I love that story

1681
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:16,279
and the others that are just yes your

1682
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:19,960
water source water is super important

1683
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:22,000
but is the system to you know after that

1684
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:25,439
let's take a look at the whole system

1685
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
too and see what other potential um

1686
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,119
contaminants could be introduced and why

1687
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,399
it's pretty

1688
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:35,079
fascinating yeah love it very cool well

1689
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:37,439
I really appreciate your time today uh I

1690
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:39,639
learned a ton of things and I hope we

1691
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:44,000
can stay in touch as you continue to

1692
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:46,520
learn more about chloramine and P and

1693
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,760
heavy metals I know this is a constantly

1694
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,480
evolving uh industry we're still

1695
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,119
learning so much about water that's

1696
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:55,279
really amazing to me we haven't figured

1697
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:57,238
it all out yet so isn't amazing like

1698
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:59,079
said it's just one thing to be

1699
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:01,718
comfortable in drinking water but when

1700
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:03,760
we start growing plants all of the

1701
01:13:01,719 --> 01:13:06,198
different things we've discovered about

1702
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:09,600
water and how much we still don't know

1703
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:12,399
about its effects you know on on what we

1704
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,120
do as as Horticultural you know as as

1705
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:19,599
growers in our our spaces so just been a

1706
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:19,599
lot of fun thanks for reaching out
