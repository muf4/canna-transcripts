welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,919
science podcast I'm your host Tad h of

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,679
Kiss Organics this is the podcast where

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,640
we discuss The Cutting Edge of growing

6
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,919
from a science-based perspective and

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,079
drawn top experts around the industry to

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,679
share their wisdom and knowledge my

9
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,600
guest this week is Bryant Mason I've had

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,200
Bryant on the podcast a few times in the

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,520
past and he's one of my favorite guests

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,399
Bryant is a certified crop adviser who

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,000
specializes in organic cannabis

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,120
nutrition he has spent the last 5 years

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,238
working to combine Precision laboratory

16
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,079
techniques with data science in an

17
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,718
effort to unravel the complexities of

18
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,878
cannabis soil and crop nutrition along

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,600
with his work on soilless media he also

20
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:00,960
helps outdoor cultivators around the

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,160
United un states with nutrient

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,920
management and cover cropping if you

23
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,200
would like to do soil testing help with

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,200
interpreting a soil test or interested

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
in an online course on these subjects

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,359

discount code kis Organics all one word

30
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,959
and I've taken this course and was

31
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,078
recently going back to review some of

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,919
the content it's excellent and I highly

33
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,000
recommend it for anyone wanting to do a

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,478
deep dive on cannabis fertility and

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,879
reusing your soil now on to the

36
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,280
show okay we are jumping back in with

37
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,478
part two of my conversation with Bryant

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,519
Mason talking about soil fertility and

39
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,359
cannabis

40
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,599
nutrition why don't we talk about

41
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,200
potassium but

42
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,959
briefly it's quite loquacious with the

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,118
calcium so we can we can condense it so

44
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:58,158
potassium I've been thinking a lot about

45
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:01,000
due to the fact that for years I've

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,159
recommended potassium sulfate

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,478
for potassium and that's

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,239
because um well two reasons one is I I

49
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,239
always suggest recommend I always

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,759
suggest compost um well not always I'm

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,800
sorry I also suggest compost which is a

52
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,679
major source of potassium but the

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,640
content of potassium varies between

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,480
composts and um when I look at a soil

55
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,878
test it's often in the middle of a round

56
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,359
and so they it needs potassium

57
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,280
immediately sometimes going into flour

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
um so potassium sulfate is the best

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,680
organic option pottassium silicate is

60
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,959
not technically organic when it's soil

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,480
applied it's allowed in certain

62
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,319
circumstances as a um fungicide foler

63
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,000
applied um but nutritionally it's not

64
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,318
allowed so potassium sulfate is kind of

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,479
the the product

66
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:52,158
um and I've made a couple changes in the

67
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,479
last year in my thinking around

68
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:56,959
potassium sulfate I still think is a

69
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:59,199
great product works very well um but I

70
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,000
believe Growers should verify their need

71
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,479
for pot potassium with a tissue test so

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,400
if if they get a recommendation that

73
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,598
says use this much potassium sulfate I

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,158
best practice would be to verify with a

75
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,839
tissue test because often times I'll

76
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,560
see relatively low pottassium at least

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,759
below my target level but that's there's

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,878
sufficiency in the tissue test and so an

79
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:25,079
application of pottassium sulfate is not

80
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:27,359
necessary um and I haven't seen that

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,799
many tissue tests that show deficient

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,959
potassium so it's possible what I'm

83
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,360
reevaluating my soil targets slightly

84
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,400
and I I might lower them what's yeah so

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,319
that's just a that's just one change I'm

86
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,879
thinking about um the other thing is

87
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,318
because of that high solubility of

88
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,079
potassium sulfate I believe Growers

89
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,839
should increase the frequency of

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,920
application so let's say the soil doctor

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,120
tool recommends A cup per cubic yard of

92
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,438
potassium sulfate which would be a lot I

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,239
don't recommend doing a cup all at once

94
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,598
the more you can break that into four to

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,640
10 applications the better

96
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,598
um because again you're reducing the

97
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,839
salt stress but also when you flood the

98
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,119
soil solution with that much

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,878
potassium it will completely change the

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,959
cation uptake Dynamics so when it comes

101
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,879
to Epsom salts and potassium sulfate

102
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,759
Epsom salt is usually not used as I

103
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,439
don't recommend it very often with as a

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,439
soil drench potassium sulfate I do I

105
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:28,199
think those two you you increase the

106
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,600
frequency um and then the final thing is

107
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,600
I do think it's good to be constantly

108
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,199
building potassium levels slow relasing

109
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,280
um more organic meaning carbon-based

110
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,680
sources of potassium using Alternatives

111
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,239
like compost and Al phalam the reason Al

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,360
falam is so great and I know you've

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,319
always used a lot of Al falam and I've

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,879
always I recommend it as kind of one of

115
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,120
this the few default nitrogen sources

116
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,038
when I write

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,079
recommendations

118
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:59,319
um historically because of the more slow

119
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,879
releasing nature of it and the triol and

120
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,800
some of the BIOS simulant effects but

121
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,120
now it's because it also brings in a lot

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
of potassium because when you apply

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,600
Alfalfa it doesn't have a ton of

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
nitrogen in it and so you're applying a

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,280
large quantity and it also brings in a

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,199
lot of potassium that's slow releasing I

127
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,038
would say green sand but green sand I

128
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,160
don't think in cannabis makes sense

129
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:23,519
because heavy metals um so just always

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,280
be applying high potassium compost or

131
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,959
just any moderate potassium compost and

132
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:32,198
green and use Al phalam as one of the

133
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,318
nitrogen sources um I would say that the

134
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,520
the second place sort of the silver and

135
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,960
bronze metal would be insect fras which

136
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,399
I know you love and granular poultry

137
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,638
which I love those two both bring in

138
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:47,918
about 4%

139
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,560
um uh potash K k2o

140
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,159
so yeah I think those are the things i'

141
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,399
i' I'd say about potassium is is just

142
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,120
trying to reduce potassium sulfate um

143
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,560
not entirely but thinking about other

144
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,720
sources as

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,319
well yeah I I love potassium sulfate I

146
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
mean it's one of my favorite amendments

147
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,639
I think it's something that every grower

148
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,560
needs to have in their Pantry um in fact

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,199
I want to do a a talk on that here soon

150
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,280
like the the products I think every

151
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
grower should have and they're not

152
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,119
really products you know they're things

153
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,360
like gypsum and uh potassium sulfate

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,399
they're not expensive but you want to

155
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,919
have them on hand for when you need them

156
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,079
um but like you said 50% potassium

157
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,879
highly soluble if you see potassium

158
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,758
deficiency you want to address one it is

159
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:38,439
the fastest and best way to get

160
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,598
potassium into into the plant age the

161
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,160
what you brought up I think is really

162
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,719
interesting in terms of splitting up

163
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,360
your applications to lower the salt

164
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,960
stress um I'm I want to I want to think

165
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,280
about that a little bit and see how I

166
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:54,239
can incorporate that um you mentioned

167
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,758
compost and while I think compost is

168
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,759
great I have moved away from

169
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,160
recommending it quite as much um for a

170
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,520
few reasons so one you're reintroducing

171
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,000
fungus knats that next cycle on a

172
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,439
commercial scale it's just annoying and

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,918
can get expensive with all the

174
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,038
beneficials and other stuff I mean

175
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,399
relatively easy to deal with but still

176
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,478
you know Annoying uh bringing in bugs

177
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:21,198
and it's it's a it's a vector for

178
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:25,439
pathogens potentially so I I've stopped

179
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,560
doing compost additions every cycle um

180
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,680
just for that reason and the fact that

181
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,240
like not everyone tests their compost

182
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,519
compost can be inconsistent so even

183
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,079
though they have one test showing it's h

184
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,519
potassium one cycle the next cycle that

185
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,079
that compost Source could be something

186
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,000
totally different um I still love

187
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:45,439
compost I just I'm not quite as

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,560
enthusiastic about it as I used to be um

189
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,319
in the past but fair just some just some

190
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,158
things for people to think about as

191
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,000
they're uh determining what they're

192
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:58,759
going to add each cycle I I love insect

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,720
frass like you mentioned um it's clean

194
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,879
it's got good microbial activity and

195
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,080
life in it in addition to having a

196
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,800
pretty balanced NPK value um but we you

197
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,639
do have to account for the other the

198
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
other nutrients in there the n and the P

199
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,918
that you're bringing in um and then

200
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,800
alphalpha meal like you said it's such a

201
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,918
low NPK value for the most part um I the

202
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,639
the end it brings in is pretty

203
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,318
negligible and it just has a ton of

204
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,840
different other

205
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,720
benefits um the triacontanol is

206
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,839
interesting because I think from what I

207
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,080
from talking to a plant growth hormone

208
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:37,559
guy uh I'm gonna butcher his name it was

209
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Jim Gray maybe it was Jim something or

210
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,359
other I I interviewed on it a little

211
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,399
while back he was a retired plant

212
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
hormone guy and he said that

213
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,600
triacontanol breaks down so quickly that

214
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,320
unless you're putting out

215
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,839
like actual Alfalfa and just laying it

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,160
on the surface that triacontanol is just

217
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,920
not going to make it into the

218
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,159
interesting interesting um yeah that

219
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,120
that could be I mean I don't Al Alpha 4

220
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,639
the triol which is more of just like a

221
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,039
yeah and just to clarify I would only

222
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,278
apply I would not apply alala insect

223
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,120
fress or Gran poultry for pottassium I

224
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:14,720
would apply those I would choose those

225
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,799
products for

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,480
nitrogen knowing that it's going to a

227
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:22,159
secondary benefit is it'll build uh

228
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,120
potassium but you always fulfill your

229
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,000
nitrogen deficit

230
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,720
first just just for listeners who that's

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,879
no that's a that's a really good point

232
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,920
um I'm glad glad you I'm glad you

233
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,278
brought that up um and I I would add

234
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,599
further that I don't like to use

235
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:40,600
potassium sulfate all that frequently um

236
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,079
when re amending my soil uh at high

237
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,959
rates I I because it is so soble I like

238
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:49,120
to use it during the growth cycle kind

239
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:52,399
of as that like liquid bottled nutrient

240
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,600
sort of application it's my Band-Aid to

241
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,759
except you don't have to use liquid

242
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,440
bottle nutrients that's the exct well so

243
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,439
my my liquid bottle nutrient is fish

244
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,399
hydraulic usually that's right me too me

245
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,440
too yeah that that's my go-to when I see

246
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,000
a problem yeah yeah yeah no I I I agree

247
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,839
that's you know there's a few things I

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,399
use in bottles and they're not yeah one

249
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,120
of them is liquid fish I love it um yeah

250
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,639
and I would mention with compost for

251
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,839
those who have received recommendations

252
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,759
from me you usually don't see compost

253
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,320
because I don't recommend it if your

254
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,480
sodium's high or your nitrogen's high or

255
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,959
your salts are too

256
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,920
high and i' I've gone back and forth

257
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,278
about recommending it at all because if

258
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,319
I don't know what it is I mean there's

259
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:40,399
just such a wild difference

260
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,120
between uh horse manure and uh worm

261
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,240
castings made in someone's basement like

262
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,278
it's just they it it varies so much that

263
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,720
unless I have a test which I rarely do I

264
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,278
don't like recommending it so in

265
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,800
addition to fungus snaps there's a

266
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,480
number of other thing considerations

267
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,679
with compost for sure even the carbon

268
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,920
niton ratio it's like that can really

269
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,958
that can really screw people up quickly

270
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,639
um um so I don't necessarily because I'm

271
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,518
not able to control for all those

272
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,519
variables uh as just writing a slil

273
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,480
recommendation I too have sort of

274
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,039
straight away from it but anyway I just

275
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
mentioned it because it is a good

276
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,559
potassium Source um so if people can

277
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,759
account for all those other factors it's

278
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,359
something to

279
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,319
consider a absolutely and I I think an

280
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
interesting way to get the Amendments

281
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,639
out is to use compost to mix them in

282
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
with a little bit of compost to get that

283
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,839
biology in there when you're top

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,078
dressing um when you're amending mix it

285
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,040
in with a little bit of soil or apply

286
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,000
some of those um amendments into your

287
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,319
worm bin or into your compost pile as a

288
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,958
way of raising the fertility of the pile

289
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
itself um but interesting enough this is

290
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,399
a little off topic too it's a a tangent

291
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:48,319
but I've been having this discussion on

292
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:52,600
a um soil analyst for Forum with Steve

293
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,519
Solomon because someone posted a um a

294
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,720
soil recipe that they found online for

295
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,120
living soil for cannabis

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,680
indoors and so we got in this huge

297
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,200
discussion about it and um my my point

298
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,638
and I I think you'll agree with me on

299
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,199
this one is all living soil recipes all

300
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,919
soil recipes should be based around your

301
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:17,439
compost because it is so variable that's

302
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,198
where I always start absolutely so when

303
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,120
you see a recipe online that says you

304
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:26,198
know 20% earthworm castings or 20%

305
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,399
compost that fraction is going to vary

306
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:32,078
so much and determine what the other

307
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:35,159
inputs are are that I don't trust any of

308
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:37,599
these recipes and I say this as someone

309
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,958
as a manufacturer who sells a nutrient

310
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,639
pack which is designed to be mixed with

311
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,799
you know either something like ocean

312
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:48,120
forest or promix or um you make your own

313
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,120
sort of living soil by taking you know

314
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,679
our mineral nutrient pack and adding

315
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,560
compost and Peete moss and even with

316
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,078
that my degree of confidence goes down

317
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,919
because that compost can can like you

318
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:05,159
said it can it can be imbalanced it can

319
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:09,278
have way too much n nitrogen ammonium uh

320
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,958
you know potassium whatever totally yeah

321
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,919
so um I think that's that's and that's

322
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,759
why I don't like soil recipes and I

323
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,479
don't people have I can't tell you how

324
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,519
many requests I've had for so like do

325
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,920
you have a soil recipe it's like no and

326
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,560
that's why it's because comp the compost

327
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:31,078
variability um so yeah and like to kind

328
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,278
of piggyback on that is I get requests

329
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:37,000
like I want to make my own soil mix and

330
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:39,000
to that I always say like that's great

331
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,399
and then I just say but just so you

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,879
understand the process for me like for

333
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,360
me to formulate a soil is going to take

334
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,559
let's say six months aggressively at

335
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,879
best to probably two years realistically

336
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:51,039
before it be something that I want to

337
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,360
like put out with my name on it because

338
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,360
the amount like initially you got to

339
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,159
find your compost Source you got to test

340
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,560
that then you got to mix up a soil um

341
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,240
and see what you get and then you have

342
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,479
to make adjustments and then once you

343
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,480
get everything where you want on the

344
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,199
soil test then you do plant trials and

345
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
see how that goes and so right that

346
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,919
process just takes a really long time if

347
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,799
you want to do it right you know you

348
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,000
can't just throw a bunch of things

349
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,399
together throw a plant in there and if

350
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,198
it grows well assume that you've got

351
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,120
this amazing soil mix now if you're a

352
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,278
hom grower I think that's that's fine

353
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,000
and I absolutely encourage

354
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,639
experimentation but um if you're on a

355
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,399
commercial scale that's just not

356
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,159
practical um and that's why I would add

357
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,519
too that like the first thing I coach

358
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,278
people to do is to to not even worry

359
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,320
about the chemistry well first you worry

360
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,600
about the chemistry of the compost and

361
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,839
you test as many composts as you have

362
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,040
access to and you you choose the right

363
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,560
site or single compost and then you go

364
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,599
you forget the chemistry you choose

365
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,679
those combos and then you just do like

366
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,199
physical tests so you try to get your

367
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,278
percentages right and you want you put

368
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,479
it in the bed or the pot and you water

369
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,600
it and you w and you just you feel it

370
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,639
and you watch the infiltration rate and

371
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,320
you have to dial in the percentages and

372
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,919
then you go back to the chemistry and

373
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,560
you just get the base mix right before

374
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,759
you do the any of the Amendments because

375
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,559
to me you want to customize your

376
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,480
amendments based on what your um your

377
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:19,000
base mix is and I go through all of this

378
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,440
in my course and that like you said the

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,600
the process is

380
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,959
um potentially totally

381
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:32,720
worthwhile but no doubt laborious and

382
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,719
long and involved it's not a simple

383
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,879
Coots mix or whatever if you really want

384
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,360
to do it right it's a

385
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,519
process yeah and even cot says like you

386
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,560
don't have his mix because you don't

387
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,600
have his vermac compost and I think

388
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,278
that's really true um that's why I hear

389
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,639
people that say you know C Mix works

390
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,879
really well for me and other people that

391
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,079
say like this this is a terrible recipe

392
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,559
and uh you know it's not balanced at all

393
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,239
it really depends yeah right right right

394
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,239
well let me can I can we chat about iron

395
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,639
real quick before we talk about carbon

396
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,839
yeah yeah go ahead let's do it okay so

397
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,159
it's sort of similar I've evolved my

398
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,920
thinking on iron iron sulfate

399
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,439
specifically but iron in general

400
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,599
because I have

401
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,880
observed wildly varying levels on tissue

402
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,000
tests of iron and it's hard to note

403
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,799
because iron contaminates both soil

404
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,480
samples but more so tissue samples all

405
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,120
the time it contam soil samples

406
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,800
sometimes on the past test because um

407
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,480
little pieces of soil or clay

408
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,359
specifically can slip through the filter

409
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,800
paper at the lab and it will show a

410
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,519
really high iron level in on a pace test

411
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,078
which isn't a huge deal what's more

412
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,560
important is if you have dust on a

413
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:51,559
tissue test on any s tissue sample that

414
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:53,318
dust can can go through the the tissue

415
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,078
test and show that you have

416
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:57,719
extraordinarily high levels of iron so

417
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,559
that could be the case it also just

418
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,278
could be that the plant actually will

419
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,399
sometimes accumulate huge amounts of

420
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,838
iron at different points mostly further

421
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,078
into flour um but sometimes I'll just

422
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,438
see really high iron levels and and

423
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,678
sometimes I'll see really low iron

424
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,240
levels and there are some Growers that

425
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,640
my recommendations of iron sulfate have

426
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,838
not been able to effectively address

427
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,000
their iron hunger I don't want to say

428
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,838
deficiency because it's not usually not

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,880
so acute that it's visual it's usually

430
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,960
just we're seeing it in the data and I

431
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,280
can't get that that number to move and

432
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,400
that's almost I'm almost I'm 100%

433
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,599
confident because iron sulfate when you

434
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,080
apply it

435
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:44,240
um it oxidizes very quickly imagine like

436
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:46,759
the the chemical reaction of rusting and

437
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,440
so once it oxidizes it goes into an

438
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,839
ionic State that's not available to the

439
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,279
plant and so when you drench iron

440
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:55,439
sulfate in a high oxygen soil and in a

441
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,720
high pH soil and when I say high pH I

442
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,519
mean anything over six it it could

443
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,480
oxidize like immediately even with a

444
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,599
humic substance like you know when you

445
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,880
mix iron sulfate with humic acid and you

446
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:11,319
drench it into a soil pH of seven I

447
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:14,159
think it oxidizes I don't see the and

448
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:15,439
and the data constantly humbles me

449
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,159
because I think I know how to do

450
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,320
something and then I always just follow

451
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,640
the data and sometimes it tells me I

452
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:24,480
don't and so this is a big learning for

453
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,880
me is in know in these soils that we're

454
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,279
working in I think iron is oxidizing and

455
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,919
very little of it is making into the

456
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,678
plant immediately it's not to say you

457
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,120
shouldn't apply iron sulfate because I

458
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,120
do think there's something to say about

459
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:41,678
loading your soil with iron which will

460
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:43,918
be reduced in the risos spere um or by

461
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,159
you know in with different sort of

462
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,799
magical risos spere reactions and

463
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,840
organic acids but I think if your plant

464
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:54,359
needs

465
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:56,759
iron um a better technique may be to

466
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,678
core the iron

467
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,599
sulfate uh 50 50 iron sulfate and

468
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,960
Elemental

469
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,678
sulfur somewhere in your root Zone in a

470
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,960
little pocket when I say core I mean

471
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,640
like a pocket of iron sulfate and

472
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,319
Elemental sulfur and what that does is

473
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,759
it creates this little pocket of a low

474
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,000
PH environment really low like in the

475
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,798
fours maybe

476
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,440
and at least in the fives and that keeps

477
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:27,759
the iron in a reduced form and you don't

478
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,360
what I've uh learned again in tree fruit

479
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,240
production this is a technique I get

480
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,479
from orcharding uh orchardists can have

481
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,200
an iron deficiency their whole canopy is

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,919
like that sort of yellow chlorotic look

483
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,120
and they core just a little bit of iron

484
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,919
sulfate at the base of their trees and

485
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:48,319
it it works very quickly and they're

486
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,360
their trees can green up and

487
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,678
um yeah I mean you could also throw a

488
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,918
little manganese sulfate in there

489
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,919
actually but manganese sulfate to me is

490
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,720
more effective with a drench so you

491
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,600
create that pocket in the Roots it

492
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
doesn't need to be homogeneous The Roots

493
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,839
can just tap into that little pocket and

494
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,798
take up iron in the available form so

495
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,798
and then the only other thing I'll

496
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:12,839
mention there is again there are

497
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:14,079
alternatives if you use alala and blood

498
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,199
meal for

499
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,839
nitrogen again you're using those for

500
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,759
nitrogen not for iron but in doing so

501
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,240
you're bringing in a lot of slow

502
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,519
releasing organically complex iron into

503
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,000
your into your soil system um which will

504
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,279
help prevent the iron hunger in the

505
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,159
first place I believe I see this all the

506
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,240
time in cannabis when I I was growing

507
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,760
commercially six years ago or something

508
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,359
in Oregon and I would the tops of the

509
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,879
plants would always be a little bit

510
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,839
yellow and I just thought because a lot

511
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,320
of plants it's just sort of normal they

512
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:49,519
always green up eventually but that sort

513
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:51,558
of top choot growth that new apical

514
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,119
growth when it's sort of light color I

515
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:57,319
always attribute that to iron

516
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,839
um but again I just follow the data and

517
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,480
I like to

518
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,199
just look at what the tissue numbers say

519
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,400
and address it that way that's really

520
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,640
interesting

521
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,759
so I I haven't thought as much about

522
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,200
iron uh Brandon and I um Brandon Hudson

523
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,599
who you mentioned before we we've talked

524
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,519
about this um and we just look at we've

525
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:18,879
just always uh his point was that yes

526
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,158
the plant may need a little more iron

527
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,320
right there but that's just because it

528
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,960
can't keep up with the amount of growth

529
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,319
it's getting at that point and that's

530
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,640
just going to Green up and go away

531
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,599
because it does um so we haven't I

532
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,080
haven't really addressed it the one

533
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,439
thing when you said low ph and pocket my

534
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:38,480
brain immediately just went heavy metals

535
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,480
like ah are we are we putting ourselves

536
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,679
more at risk for heavy metal uptake by

537
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,720
having a pocket of low PH soil in the

538
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,278
rise ofhere I don't that's a good that's

539
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,679
a good question but I would I would my

540
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:54,599
mental model to answer that question is

541
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,080
that the nutrient uptake is evenly

542
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,959
distributed across the entire bulk soil

543
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:02,599
and the pocket is is probably less than

544
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
1% of the bulk soil so yeah you're going

545
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,759
to make heavy metals potentially more

546
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,400
available in that pocket and I'm talking

547
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:11,519
the size of your fist like so yeah the

548
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,480
heavy metals be will be more available

549
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,558
in a in a pocket of soil the size of

550
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,839
your fist but that's just such a small

551
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:20,599
pocket of soil that unless you had an a

552
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,079
large heavy metal load I don't think it

553
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,119
should matter it's just so dilute not

554
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,079
dilute but it's so small

555
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:30,038
um that's a really interesting

556
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,839
experiment I would love to run it but I

557
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:33,839
also don't want to then throw off all my

558
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,519
soil tests moving forward because well

559
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,278
okay so that's oh that's a great point

560
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,558
that is a great Point as soon as you

561
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:42,400
start coring iron sulfate you you have

562
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,678
to ignore the iron number on the soil

563
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,278
test so if you put your soil test

564
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,679
through the soil doctor

565
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,278
tool you have to disregard the iron

566
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,679
sulfate recommendation coming out of

567
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:53,640
that tool and you have to go solely off

568
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,480
of tissue tests and

569
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,240
visuals because the soil is

570
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,599
non-homogeneous so you're either going

571
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,640
to see low iron because when you're

572
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,678
sampling your soil you don't hit that

573
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,278
pocket and so it's going to show or

574
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,480
you're going to hit the pocket and

575
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:09,558
you're going to have really really high

576
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,640
iron on this on the soil test both of

577
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,000
those situations are are suboptimal and

578
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,840
they're not accurate so you have to go

579
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,159
off

580
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,599
tissue have you done this with cannabis

581
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,278
and seen that immediate Greening of New

582
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,798
Growth then where you don't get that

583
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,359
well the grow I I don't see it but the

584
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,359
Growers I work with do and okay so

585
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,038
people have this and seen I I haven't

586
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,158
gotten reports of the visual of of the

587
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,720
top growth yellowing I haven't asked

588
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,159
that question what I see is the tissue

589
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,960
test finally

590
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:44,760
moves okay interesting yeah I but they

591
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,720
but but the grower who did it did it at

592
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,480
a kind of a high well a couple people

593
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,519
have done it now but the first one who

594
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,839
did it was did it at a rate that was um

595
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,839
maybe a little too high he said they

596
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,759
they seemed to have a little bit more

597
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,798
transplant shock but they grow out grew

598
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,440
out out of it really quickly to me that

599
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:04,038
means you lower the rate I don't think

600
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,400
transplant shock is ever good um

601
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:09,440
especially from a a fertilizer so I told

602
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,840
him to cut the rate in half and and do

603
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,960
it again this guy had really cool guy up

604
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,599
in Michigan worked with a lot tests like

605
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,798
a bandit and so he's got this amazing

606
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:26,319
body of data and we just it's like iron

607
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:28,480
sulfate every round and it the numbers

608
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,839
just wouldn't move and finally we got

609
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,839
him to move with this this

610
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,439
core that is really interesting I'll

611
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,359
have to think about that um and that's

612
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,240
actually a really good segue into the

613
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:44,719
next topic which

614
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:48,159
is uh amino acids because

615
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,679
um well maybe not the best segue but my

616
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,120
point is you'll see products now and and

617
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,480
we talked about this a little before the

618
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,038
podcast how um there there's products

619
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,599
out there you know primarily with

620
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,440
micronutrients

621
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,839
um that are approved for use in organic

622
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,080
production and they're supposedly like

623
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:09,439
organic forms of these minerals um but

624
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,000
when you look at the derivation

625
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,000
statement the ingredients they're all

626
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,919
derived from sulfates so you may have

627
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,119
like an organic manganese product let's

628
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,278
say but when you look at what it's

629
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,199
derived from it's derived from manganese

630
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:26,880
sulfate so are these products really any

631
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,440
more organic um or really better than

632
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,320
just applying the meganes sulfate

633
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,360
directly so I realize this isn't exactly

634
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,398
what we're talking about but I want to

635
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,599
touch start there so the aminated

636
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,479
micronutrient products that I see that

637
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,000
are certified organic are primarily for

638
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,000
folar is that what you're referring to

639
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,359
so we're talking bioman

640
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,119
albon um I was using this year my

641
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,798
Orchard polyamine so what those are is

642
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,239
you're right they take these just sort

643
00:25:52,798 --> 00:26:00,798
of raw mineral amendments like let's say

644
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,839
zinc salt sulfate and they combine them

645
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:06,079
with amino acids

646
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,558
probably the same amino acids we're

647
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:12,119
using which is um ground up soybean meal

648
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:17,359
it's pulverized like

649
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:19,678
soluble soy based amino acids

650
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,719
and that would be the mo I don't

651
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,278
actually know how they're made because

652
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,079
it's proprietary but that's probably

653
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,440
like the rudimentary way they mix them

654
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,038
together and they keyate them so when

655
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,880
you combine those two things it keates

656
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,720
them and in theory it keeps them more

657
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,278
available

658
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,960
um so when they hit the plant leaf

659
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:39,038
they're not going to oxidize as quickly

660
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,919
and there's just better um Leaf

661
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,919
penetration with amino acids better

662
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,399
uptake efficiency and so you're getting

663
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,240
more unit of nutrient into the plant

664
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:53,199
which I believe is true now now if the

665
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,000
increase in folar efficiency offsets the

666
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,159
increase in cost of the product I don't

667
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,640
know I've always wondered that I've

668
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,559
always wondered should I just apply iron

669
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,159
sulfate chelated with fulvic acid is

670
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,480
that going to be way more costeffective

671
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,480
on three acres than than applying albon

672
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,839
metalosate iron which costs quite a bit

673
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,200
of money um so in theory different

674
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,439
micronutrients are chelated better with

675
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,880
different individual amino acids so

676
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,640
manganese for example is a little

677
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,440
tougher to chelate so they might use uh

678
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,520
an amino acid like high in glycine or

679
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,320
something I'm making that

680
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:32,000
up um but are they more organic I mean

681
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,038
is your definition of organic like just

682
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,759
certified organic I mean they're both

683
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:41,519
both manganese sulfate

684
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:43,038
and uh bottled chelated manganese is

685
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,759
they're both certified so I don't know

686
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,119
if they're they're more organic I mean

687
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,558
you are applying it with carbon which is

688
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,398
way preferable

689
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,200
foler um but you could do that yourself

690
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,518
you could do molasses and a little bit

691
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,679
of a touch of kelp and well not in

692
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,759
cannabis produ I wouldn't do kelp but a

693
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,840
touch of molasses and fulvic acid would

694
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,919
be a carbon Source um my issue is

695
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,319
there's no way to know if that if how

696
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,320
much better they are if that if that

697
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:13,319
uptake efficiency and the and the

698
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:16,079
nutrient use efficiency inside the plant

699
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:19,319
is that much better to justify the cost

700
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,639
of of these branded chelated products um

701
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,158
I've always used them but this year I'm

702
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,519
breaking my farm in half this isn't

703
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,760
actually testing this specific

704
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,599
hypothesis but I'm break breaking my

705
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:33,440
farm in half and I'm going to do every

706
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:36,278
organic foler calcium foler

707
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,120
specifically um including the jadam

708
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:40,679
stuff and and a lot of these branded

709
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,319
Amino culated products on half of my

710
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,960
trees and I'm not going to do a single

711
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,918
calcium foler on the other half and I'm

712
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,880
just curious to see if any of them are

713
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,919
really making that big of a difference

714
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,799
um which let me just this is a tangent

715
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,399
and I know I'm talking a lot

716
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:59,119
but I want to just

717
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,959
pitch to every grower listening that

718
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,719
they should be split testing every time

719
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,360
there's an expensive

720
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,399
input if you can you can't do too many

721
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,119
split tests obviously but you should

722
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:11,839
break your bedroom in half or you should

723
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,959
break your field in half or you should

724
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:19,000
break your grow tent in half and do no

725
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,360
treatment on half and do the treatment

726
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,119
on the other half because it's

727
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,839
amazing the level of faith that Growers

728
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:31,000
have in products it's amazing and

729
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,519
because in part you kind of have to

730
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,720
because you just have to believe

731
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:39,759
something and then do it but I'm here to

732
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:42,278
say to argue if if possible break your

733
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,038
your room in half and you can be a

734
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:46,440
little less faithful and actually put it

735
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:49,359
to the test I think this is a

736
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,360
characteristic I see in so many really

737
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,079
good Growers who I've spoken to is

738
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,879
they're constantly testing something

739
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,599
even if it's just one thing one thing at

740
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,760
a I mean preferably one thing at a time

741
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:06,480
split test whatever is your highest cost

742
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:08,398
input that you're not 100% confident is

743
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,880
justifiable I couldn't agree more with

744
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,798
you it drives me nuts the amount of

745
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,399
products that are hyped to this

746
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,079
specifically to the Canabis industry but

747
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,199
it's not even unique to cannabis we see

748
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,839
it in egg too which is crazy because

749
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,759
I'll go to an egg conference and I'll be

750
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,359
like talking to a guy and be like I'm

751
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,798
pretty sure you're full of [ __ ] but like

752
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,359
you're obviously selling a lot of your

753
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:32,119
product you know like you're a business

754
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,038
yeah it drives me nuts and and well go

755
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,479
ahead go

756
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:37,519
ahead well I just I I was just going to

757
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,558
say that and even and I think that the

758
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,038
the salesman too they they they believe

759
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:42,839
it so it's it's hard because when

760
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,759
another human looks you in the eyes and

761
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:48,519
they they have conviction that something

762
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,440
works there's there's a natural tendency

763
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,240
to to want to believe them so I I don't

764
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,558
think it's like yeah I don't think it's

765
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,679
like a

766
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:59,798
a character flaw I just think it's part

767
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,320
of human bias and I think we all just

768
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:04,480
should be fighting against it all the

769
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:07,439
time and and to your point I'm testing

770
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,319
these folur primarily because every tree

771
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,639
fruit grower in my

772
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:16,599
area is is spending an enormous amount

773
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:20,079
of money on Amino kated folar

774
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:21,918
sprays and no there's no nobody knows if

775
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,558
they actually work they either think

776
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,480
they work or they think they don't work

777
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:27,918
but there's no there's no trials there's

778
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,079
no evidence there's

779
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,480
there's nothing and so split tests are

780
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,359
the only way to know and they're they're

781
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,880
not they're not scientific in that

782
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,439
there's not replicates so you can't find

783
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,120
statistical significance but we're not

784
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,360
scientists we're Growers so we just want

785
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,239
enough evidence to make the right

786
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,000
management decision so split tests are

787
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,038
totally

788
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,440
great and to your point realistically we

789
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:54,480
just have to know what works in our grow

790
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,798
in our environment in our garden it

791
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,440
doesn't matter how effective it is in

792
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,119
New Zealand you know it matters what

793
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,720
works for me here in Washington state um

794
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,798
and there's so many variables involved

795
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,159
in that like we've talked about you know

796
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,918
temperature moisture environment water

797
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,519
um you know sunlight all of these things

798
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:15,320
are going to come into play and when I'm

799
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,200
Consulting and I walk into a facility

800
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:18,558
and I say show me what you're doing for

801
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,759
IPM show me what you're doing for

802
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:24,839
fertility and that list is really

803
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,839
long the first thing I want to do yeah

804
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,038
you have no idea you have no idea what

805
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:32,959
is doing what um I want to I want to

806
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:35,278
just simplify everything and then if you

807
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,840
want to use that you know hype product

808
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,839
that you saw on Instagram fine but let's

809
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,199
work it back in let's come back to a

810
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,240
Baseline and then let's do some of that

811
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,080
you know split testing AB testing and

812
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,079
see if you're actually getting results

813
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,519
from it because at the end of the day

814
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,839
all we're doing as Growers is trying to

815
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,599
address what the limiting factor of

816
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:55,879
growth is you know leig law of the

817
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:58,599
minimum like this idea that you know if

818
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,480
if the limiting factor is the fact that

819
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:03,638
our facility has lights that are you

820
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,079
know 400 ppfd and flower it doesn't

821
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:09,398
matter what you know what

822
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:12,798
enzyme yeah ferment product I'm not

823
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:14,319
getting enough light so um and to add to

824
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,038
that you know I was talking to a grower

825
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:20,359
the other day on scale and every time he

826
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:23,119
does a foler application um for IPM it's

827
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:26,038
$6,000 you know that's a significant

828
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,038
chunk of money that he has to SP scale

829
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,398
is this cannabis yeah it's pretty

830
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:32,119
they're pretty large farm you know and

831
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,839
that I don't know if that's strictly

832
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,518
just product or labor I'm pretty sure it

833
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,319
was just the product and it was a more

834
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,919
expensive IPM product a a good product

835
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,599
you know but if he's having to spray

836
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,919
these things in in in uh on his crop

837
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,038
it's it adds up now for the hom grower

838
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,960
it may not seem like much 10 bucks 20

839
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:54,638
bucks you know whatever for a similar

840
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,960
comparative scale but um there's no

841
00:33:54,638 --> 00:34:00,158
reason we can't grow healthy plants for

842
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,159
for significantly less money um if we

843
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,080
just start thinking about this idea of

844
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,760
split testing and and well yeah and I

845
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,639
would also argue let's just put money

846
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,878
aside which obviously is everything when

847
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,878
it comes to commercial operation but the

848
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:16,398
only way to become a better grower is to

849
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:19,319
start to tease out what

850
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:22,199
that what that low hanging fruit or what

851
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,838
that bottleneck is in photosynthesis so

852
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,918
um if you just want to improve your

853
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:31,159
general ability as a grower you have to

854
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,559
start to to to reduce inputs that's the

855
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,480
only way to do it um and then increase

856
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:36,838
you know you're FL you have to learn I

857
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,760
guess that's what I'm trying to get at

858
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:42,559
is you have to be constantly

859
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,079
learning you know Kaizen all the time

860
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,398
otherwise you're not going to be

861
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,359
improving yourself like you

862
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,719
could all right so let's talk a little

863
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,358
bit about Amino assets I know it's

864
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,358
something that you've been thinking

865
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,199
about you know we just covered a little

866
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,759
bit of how people are using amino acids

867
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:03,679
as foliar because I suppose they have

868
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,720
better efficacy um I don't just give me

869
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:10,000
your thoughts on that

870
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:12,039
topic sure so the brief synop synopsis

871
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,599
on amino

872
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,400
acids as it relates to plant nutrition

873
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,119
is that well there's a few things that

874
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,320
come to mind the first is that they're

875
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,680
definitely amino acids are definitely

876
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,079
the best source of fol or applied

877
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:29,960
nitrogen and there's quite a bit of

878
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,640
research that shows that particularly in

879
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,800
field Crop Production that the nitrogen

880
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,719
use the nitrogen uptake from amino acid

881
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,400
sources of nitrogen is by far better

882
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:45,118
than any other nitrogen Source ful or

883
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,960
applied so big big um proponent of amino

884
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,200
acids in folar they are also there's

885
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,599
there's this idea of metabolic

886
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,639
shortcutting we've talked about this

887
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,800
before where if a plant does uptake

888
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,000
nitrogen in the form of amino acids or

889
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,318
or any organic form doesn't necessarily

890
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,599
have to be amino acids um plants can

891
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:07,838
actually uptake larger compounds as well

892
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,760
there's this idea that they save quite a

893
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:14,880
bit of metabolic energy by not having to

894
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,000
reduce other forms of nitrogen like

895
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,800
nitrate or ammonium into amino acids in

896
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,679
the plants because they uptake them

897
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,960
they're already in amino acid form and

898
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:29,039
that is definitely a well documented

899
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,039
phenomenon um but not studied very

900
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,880
extensively um so research the research

901
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,599
generally shows I've done a deep dive on

902
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,240
um nitrogen from organic sources and it

903
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,559
generally shows that the maximum

904
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:44,559
nitrogen use efficiency results when the

905
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:46,159
plant uptakes various forms of nitrogen

906
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,199
uh and that's because of that metabolic

907
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,239
shortcutting idea so major props to

908
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,759
organic production in this regard

909
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,358
because all of our nitrogen is

910
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,440
essentially um being applied in organic

911
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:02,759
form with carbon so the body of research

912
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,639
is sadly lacking when it comes to

913
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,040
organic nitrogen um it's organic forms

914
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,480
of nitrogen like amino acids have

915
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,079
essentially been ignored as a third pool

916
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,519
of plant available nitrogen but there

917
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,560
are a few studies that show that when

918
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:17,480
you incorporate carbon-based amino acid

919
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,400
nitrogen it increases nitrogen use

920
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,119
efficiency but I think what's important

921
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,838
to point out for the Cannabis Community

922
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:31,280
is that all organic products are either

923
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:33,480
composed of amino acids or end up as

924
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,560
amino acids for a period of time in the

925
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:41,800
process of mineralization so I think

926
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:44,759
what is confusing or maybe misleading is

927
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,519
that um we say oh I want to I want to

928
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:53,240
use amino acid nitrogen well does that

929
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:57,719
mean amino acid like a liquid uh water

930
00:37:53,239 --> 00:38:00,078
soluble liquid nitrogen from soy Bean or

931
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,719
fish that's technically marketed as

932
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,280
amino acid nitrogen because alala blood

933
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,239
meal feather meal all of these things

934
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,880
are are enzymatically digested in the

935
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:12,318
soil and end up in their constituent

936
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Parts which are amino acids so how I

937
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:15,759
think about it is when you're amending

938
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,680
your soil with Organic

939
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,319
amendments uh that are nitrogen and

940
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:23,919
carbon in in protein form those are

941
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:26,719
essentially going to create a little

942
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,639
amino acid Factory in your soil so those

943
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,078
things as those mineralize they are

944
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,598
going to end up as amino acids in your

945
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,680
soil um and then at that point the plant

946
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:38,800
will uptake some of the those amino

947
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:43,239
acids it's debatable how much of those

948
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,160
are amino acids are uptaken um before

949
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,919
the amino acids are then converted into

950
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,279
ammonium and then nitrate so all these

951
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,240
different these three different forms

952
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,960
all exist in your soil at the same time

953
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,559
and all organic products are technically

954
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,838
going to contribute amino acids so so

955
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,799
it's a little misleading to say I want

956
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:03,119
amino acid nitrogen because anything

957
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:07,519
organic is in a sense going to lead to

958
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,880
that so whether I buy a soy Amino

959
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:13,159
product or soybean meal I'm still going

960
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,640
to be getting amino acids in my soil

961
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:17,480
because of how they're going to break

962
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,759
down that's exactly right that's exactly

963
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,280
right now the amino acid nitrogen from

964
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,359
soybean meal is going to be immediate

965
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,000
it's smaller particle size and

966
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:28,960
potentially already digested into the

967
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,519
constituent amino acids so you're going

968
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,159
to get amino acids faster but they're

969
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,199
both doing the same thing they're ending

970
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,960
up at the same place and I'll add one

971
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,919
more thing I put out a video on my

972
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,480
Instagram about amino acids a while back

973
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,920
and my point in that video is to say

974
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,199
that when you drench amino acids to the

975
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
soil again there's not a good

976
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,519
understanding of how much of that is

977
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,040
directly uptaken by the plant and how

978
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:58,039
much of it is is eaten by the microbes

979
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,440
um or converted by microbes into

980
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,400
ammonium and then nitrate these so these

981
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,440
pools are constantly in flux and my

982
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,680
argument is that the again just a tiny

983
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,039
bit of of research out there shows that

984
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,519
the microbes feed very quickly and so

985
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,079
the majority of the liquid soy based

986
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,199
amino acids that we're applying are

987
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,599
probably consumed by the microbes not

988
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:20,719
the plant and there wasn't really a

989
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,680
major reason other than to just try to

990
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,159
point out what's happening in our soil

991
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:27,279
systems because even if the microbes eat

992
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,318
those amino acids they'll die

993
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,160
and release organic forms of nitrogen

994
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:34,000
back into the soil it's a cycle so it

995
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:35,920
doesn't really matter um but it's just

996
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,760
interesting to think my general belief

997
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,039
is that the microbes feed first and and

998
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,240
amino acids can turn over in soil

999
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:46,159
extremely quickly so uh anyway that's

1000
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:49,759
just another small Dynamic to for

1001
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,480
Growers to understand and think about so

1002
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,240
one thing that I'm a little unclear on

1003
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:58,760
is if the amino acids

1004
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:03,519
are if nitrogen is is in an amino acid

1005
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:06,960
form um is that different than nitrate

1006
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,400
and ammonium in Essen it is you talked a

1007
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,838
little bit about that what's happening

1008
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,039
inside the plant you said if it goes

1009
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,639
into the plant then it's converted to

1010
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,480
ammonium and then nitrate that's part of

1011
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:19,078
the nitrogen cycle why would that be

1012
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,599
superior to just nitrates in your soil

1013
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,079
for example where the plants just taking

1014
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:26,838
up a nitrate yeah so if a plant takes up

1015
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,318
a nitrate it has to convert it twice

1016
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:29,719
it essentially has to go in reverse it

1017
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,159
has to convert to ammonium and then

1018
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:35,439
amino acids to to complex it into a leaf

1019
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:38,318
as a complete protein so if if the plant

1020
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:43,318
uptakes an amino acid it doesn't have to

1021
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:45,318
convert it twice which takes a huge um

1022
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:47,599
there's a huge energetic cost to the

1023
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:49,119
plant so if it takes it up as an amino

1024
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,240
acid it can just put it directly into a

1025
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,838
protein and complex it into the leaf so

1026
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,719
you're skipping two different steps

1027
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:59,279
inside the plant if the plant uptakes uh

1028
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:03,679
an amino acid and by amino acid it

1029
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,400
technically any organic form of nitrogen

1030
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,799
um so it could be other molecules

1031
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,240
besides amino

1032
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,200
acids so then how do we correlate this

1033
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,118
with a soil test because on a soil test

1034
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,919
we're primarily looking at nitrate

1035
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:18,400
levels we want to keep ammonium levels

1036
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,280
very low in that nitrogen cycling

1037
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,838
process um and you know that's a metric

1038
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,480
so how does that

1039
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:29,000
relate yeah and this is that is million

1040
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,159
dollar question because we're not

1041
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,358
testing on a soil test we're not testing

1042
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:36,399
organic forms of nitrogen we're just

1043
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,199
seeing ammonium and nitrate and we're

1044
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,000
making our management decisions based on

1045
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:46,838
those two things and that's a limitation

1046
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,159
in soil testing there are ways that Labs

1047
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:50,679
can test organic nitrogen but it gets

1048
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:52,279
complicated and confusing because

1049
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:53,919
there's different fractions and there's

1050
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,839
different it's a totally different lab

1051
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,599
technique and um

1052
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,838
there's not a simple way to just test

1053
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,599
small uh amino acids the the small

1054
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:08,719
fraction of organic nitrogen compounds

1055
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,559
which is amino acids so I wrote a Long

1056
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,558
blog post about this called how to

1057
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,480
manage nitrogen organically it's for

1058
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,000
cannabis Growers it's on my it's on my

1059
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,440
website

1060
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,400
and I I break this down but to answer

1061
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,920
your question Tad more

1062
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,280
specifically we are just using ammonium

1063
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,720
and nitrate we get to see two out of the

1064
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,079
three pools of

1065
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:32,279
nitrogen and so we don't get to see that

1066
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,839
third pool and we're just using ammonium

1067
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,800
and nitrate as a proxy um to sort of

1068
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:42,119
understand how big those pools are

1069
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,240
because they are correlated and so my

1070
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,400
the reason I'm comfortable using

1071
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,959
ammonium and nitrate and not seeing that

1072
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,519
organic nitrogen pool on a soil test is

1073
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,000
because if the organic nitrogen pool is

1074
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:57,159
healthy you will end up seeing ammonium

1075
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,679
and nitrate because the micro convert if

1076
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,838
there's excess organic nitrogen excess

1077
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,519
amino acids it ends up as nitrate so

1078
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,799
when you see that nitrate number you

1079
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:09,280
know between let's just say 50 and 150

1080
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,880
you know that there was at one point

1081
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,519
there was an excess of that organic

1082
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,280
nitrogen pool and it converted in

1083
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:17,519
nitrate when you see the the nitrate

1084
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,160
number

1085
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:23,239
low usually that means there's not

1086
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,440
excess organic nitrogen in the system

1087
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:28,519
and so those are sort of proxies if that

1088
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,079
makes sense to to estimating how big

1089
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:35,358
that organic pool is a lot of Growers I

1090
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,800
know intentionally keep their nitrogen

1091
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:40,239
their inorganic nitrogen so nitrate and

1092
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,640
ammonium they keep those pools low so on

1093
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:45,399
a soil test it might be 15 parts per

1094
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,318
million or something and they feed those

1095
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,000
organic sources of nitrogen as the plant

1096
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:51,440
needs it and I think they do so

1097
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,480
primarily based on visual symptoms and

1098
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,519
occasional tissue tests so soil testing

1099
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,440
is flawed in that respect in my opinion

1100
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,880
for organic growers in particular um you

1101
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,838
still want to know ammonium and nitrate

1102
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,559
it's good proxy for organic nitrogen but

1103
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:08,880
it's it's not a direct measurement and

1104
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,720
then along those lines that total

1105
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,800
nitrogen number that you can also get

1106
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:17,078
from on on the standard test that's not

1107
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,119
really showing us that either then huh

1108
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:21,599
the reason that one's not good is

1109
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,440
because it's also like if you imagine a

1110
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,960
chunk of

1111
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,119
alal that's not plant available that's

1112
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,480
still a protein

1113
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:34,400
meal so it's it's still plant material

1114
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,880
and so that nitrogen has not been

1115
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,680
enzymatically broken down biologically

1116
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,519
digested into small enough organic

1117
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:45,159
nitrogen pieces amino acids to be taken

1118
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,480
up by the plant so that total nitrogen

1119
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,118
number is going to give you all the

1120
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,358
nitrogen in the soil much of which is

1121
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:54,000
not yet plant

1122
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,639
available so amino acids they're the the

1123
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,239
building box blocks of proteins

1124
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,199
proteins exist

1125
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,479
in these amendments like fish meal um

1126
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:06,078
blood meal alphalpha we're talking about

1127
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,039
specifically in relation to nitrogen

1128
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,119
here those get broken down biologically

1129
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,519
through nutrient cycling microbial

1130
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:18,318
processes in the soil in the rizosphere

1131
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:20,679
and then what's released from that is

1132
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,318
potentially all three forms of nitrogen

1133
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:24,919
is what you're saying then we'll get

1134
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,920
some organic amino acids some nitrates

1135
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,800
some ammonium depend some ammonium

1136
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,159
depending on uh what's going on in the

1137
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,119
soil that's right that's a very good

1138
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:39,639
summary okay and then these are all tied

1139
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:43,559
closely to to moisture content and

1140
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:46,039
oxygen gas exchange in the soil as well

1141
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,960
do you want to just touch on that yes

1142
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:51,599
it's it's the nitrogen Transformations

1143
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,440
are are highly dependent on on moisture

1144
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,359
and oxygen because they're biologically

1145
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,920
driven but the third variable that I

1146
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,119
think actually matters even more is

1147
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,880
temperature so the conversion if you put

1148
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,160
in feather meal into your soil and it's

1149
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,318
cold it could take weeks or months to

1150
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:08,318
really become available to to to be

1151
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,279
broken down biologically into those

1152
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:14,358
three nitrogen um

1153
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,680
molecules but in a warm soil it happens

1154
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:19,400
very quickly so and obviously um there's

1155
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,598
higher biological activity when soil

1156
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,880
moisture is optimal and when gas

1157
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,599
exchange is optimal um when gas exchange

1158
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:30,160
is not optimal the the nitrogen can

1159
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,599
essentially um that cycle will get

1160
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:35,679
plugged up and there'll be more ammonium

1161
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,000
usually uh but I almost never see that

1162
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,078
in a Pete based media in any kind of

1163
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,760
living soil I almost never see that just

1164
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,240
because gas exchange is pretty good that

1165
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,280
would be a Mucky top soil like a really

1166
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:49,759
clay heavy compacted muck um what I do

1167
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,720
see is once you amend a soil or if you

1168
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,440
were to blend your soil it would there'd

1169
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,919
be so much um organic nitrogen that goes

1170
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,880
into that system that the soil would

1171
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,680
cook and ammonium levels would spike for

1172
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,000
a period of time before they get they go

1173
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:05,399
back down and get converted into

1174
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,679
nitrate so if you were to test your soil

1175
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,559
right after amending you could see high

1176
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,519
ammonium if that soil is biologically

1177
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:14,559
active as it's converting it to nitrates

1178
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:16,838
absolutely have you have you seen that

1179
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,880
before I just saw that recently on a

1180
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:21,039
test um and it kind of surprised me

1181
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,640
because I typically when my brain when I

1182
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,960
see high ammonium numbers I

1183
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:28,838
automatically go to unfinished compost

1184
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,358
um that's just where where I head more

1185
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:32,000
and more I'm thinking of Peete based

1186
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,679
media or living let me call them living

1187
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,519
soils because a p based media with a

1188
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,879
significant um portion of

1189
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,880
compost I kind of think of them like

1190
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,800
composts because they're they're bi

1191
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,400
they're very biologically active and

1192
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,200
they're increasing in maturity over time

1193
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,798
through through biological

1194
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:56,399
mineralization and and um fungal

1195
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:58,920
decomposition and and so

1196
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,720
yeah it's unfinished compost is a great

1197
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,599
coraly and essentially when you throw a

1198
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:07,000
bunch of blood meal and alfalfa meal and

1199
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:09,680
bone meal and and fish compost

1200
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,440
into Pete Moss and cocoa core it

1201
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,399
essentially creates a little compost I

1202
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,960
mean it cooks and that's what that

1203
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,838
temperature when you when you when you

1204
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,000
like feel that temperature after you

1205
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:21,599
really mix a soil when the temperature

1206
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
spikes if you tested it at that moment

1207
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,519
in time I'd almost guarantee that the

1208
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,559
ammonium would be

1209
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:31,559
elevated yeah so what what I I aim to do

1210
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,798
when I'm amending a soil is I want to

1211
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:37,599
get as much in there at the beginning of

1212
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:39,280
a run that I can without going without

1213
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,440
triggering that thermal

1214
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,720
process because I don't want to wait for

1215
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,079
the soil to you know what we call cook

1216
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:50,838
like a like a thermophilic compost pile

1217
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:54,400
so um the goal and so the goal is then

1218
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:56,599
to amend at a rate that's high fertility

1219
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,358
but low enough that we not causing this

1220
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:00,559
explosion of microbial growth that's

1221
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,880
causing this yeah temperature increase

1222
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,640
and that's that's really the trick I

1223
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,160
think um I what your thoughts on that I

1224
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:12,039
I think the same thing and I put a

1225
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:14,039
little note for for Growers who have

1226
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:17,960
received soil recommendations from me

1227
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,960
there's a little note uh in the Nitro I

1228
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,519
have nitrogen tips and one of them says

1229
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:26,000
please let me know if your soil heats up

1230
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:29,318
because I want to know uh so then I can

1231
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,639
adjust my rates to be what you said is

1232
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:36,358
right under that that um that

1233
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,798
temperature increase and some products

1234
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:42,440
are more sus I mean blood meal is is way

1235
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:44,679
more prone to to creating temperature

1236
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,838
spikes because of the speed at which it

1237
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:50,440
releases um just the properties of

1238
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:53,279
certain nitrogen amendments will

1239
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,760
sometimes cause that and you can also

1240
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,599
smell it sometimes you can smell that

1241
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,640
ammonium um

1242
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,599
volatilizing yeah so it's important to

1243
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,400
have your moisture content right your

1244
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,838
temperature you know in your room is if

1245
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,280
if it's an indoor facility like I'm

1246
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,480
typically thinking about it the the

1247
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,599
temperature is probably going to be

1248
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,519
there already you don't have to worry

1249
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,318
about that as much but I think um making

1250
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:17,119
sure you're not over or underwatering is

1251
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:20,639
really important to allow that process

1252
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:24,000
to occur um the way you want it to and

1253
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:26,440
uh you can always add more you know a

1254
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,639
couple weeks later or a few weeks later

1255
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,920
to get to the get to your target so you

1256
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,679
don't have to get it all in there at

1257
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,480
once um just just some other notes on

1258
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:39,838
that that's right that's

1259
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,599
right um and uh since you talked about

1260
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,000
amino acids and the fact that we don't

1261
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,119
necessarily need to

1262
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,960
buy products that are labeled amino

1263
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,599
acids to get amino acids uh you know

1264
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,720
I've recently seen some products that

1265
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:56,359
are you know called carbon-based

1266
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:59,000
fertilizers um and this idea that

1267
00:51:56,358 --> 00:52:01,558
because they're carbon based um you know

1268
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,760
they're Superior to other fertilizers uh

1269
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:05,559
you and I talked about this do you want

1270
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:09,359
to touch on that a little bit sure so I

1271
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:11,760
think that the in organic farming that

1272
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:16,000
label is kind of

1273
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:19,079
meaningless um because for the most part

1274
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,440
most of our or let me back up not all of

1275
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,599
our nutrients are always carbon based so

1276
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,760
we were talking about pottassium sulfate

1277
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:28,559
we're talking about gypsum that's not

1278
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:32,040
carbon based so um in general there's a

1279
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,559
lot of benefit to to using nutrients

1280
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:35,519
that are carbon based and that's kind of

1281
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:36,960
baked into organic farming when it comes

1282
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,440
to your phosphorus products and your

1283
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,679
nitrogen products and and just you know

1284
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,280
the mineralization of organic matter um

1285
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:47,639
so when someone says this is a

1286
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:50,798
carbon-based nitrogen product it just it

1287
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:53,480
it doesn't it's sort of a a redundant

1288
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:55,239
or um it doesn't mean a whole lot

1289
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,599
because all of our organic nitrogen

1290
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,239
products are already carbon based it's

1291
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,880
gained a lot of popularity in

1292
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:03,279
conventional production because

1293
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,680
conventional Growers are starting to

1294
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,519
realize that U there's a major metabolic

1295
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:11,399
and plant Health Advantage

1296
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:14,639
to incorporating carbon into their

1297
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,838
nutritional programs so I think the

1298
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,318
terminology the marketing terminology

1299
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:21,480
comes mostly from you know the

1300
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:23,719
conventional world

1301
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,719
but I don't think it has a whole lot of

1302
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:28,118
meaning when it comes to when we're

1303
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:30,439
talking about organic uh

1304
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:33,640
products and I would add that when we're

1305
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,318
talking about living soils you know PE

1306
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:40,000
based soiless media that's very

1307
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:42,880
biologically active um we we have high

1308
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,838
levels of carbon in in those mixes

1309
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,119
already um our organic matter is you

1310
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,279
know through the roof compared to

1311
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,798
anything you would see in actual soil

1312
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,880
and uh it's really important to

1313
00:53:52,798 --> 00:54:00,159
distinguish between living soil and real

1314
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,599
soil uh I can't emphasize that enough

1315
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:05,480
they're very different they it's like an

1316
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,960
apple and a banana or something or you

1317
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,760
know whatever two very distinctly

1318
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,798
different things yes both can grow

1319
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,040
plants but they do it entirely different

1320
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:16,838
ways um and that's probably a separate

1321
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,920
podcast but I I just think it's an

1322
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:22,440
important thing to to remind folks of

1323
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,599
yeah yeah definitely I'll also mention

1324
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,318
that um like for example when I fertig

1325
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,240
and we we talked about this earlier when

1326
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:34,199
I ferate micronutrient sulfates so just

1327
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:36,358
going kind of tying this around when I

1328
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:38,960
need more manganese

1329
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:42,679
sulfate maybe I'll put in 10 pounds per

1330
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,960
acre in an application I always add a

1331
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,440
carbon some kind of carbon Source

1332
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,199
whether that's

1333
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,838
molasses or kelp or usually it's humic

1334
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:54,318
acids that I dissolve

1335
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,039
overnight or even citric acid it's

1336
00:54:54,318 --> 00:55:00,960
carbon based so

1337
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:05,199
so I always am aiming to apply carbon

1338
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,039
with any application that I do and it's

1339
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,838
really easy to do that as an organic

1340
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,159
grower you just you just do the things I

1341
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,880
just said and most people are very

1342
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,519
familiar with this a compost extract or

1343
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,039
if you're top dressing you know

1344
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,239
something you can apply with a little

1345
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:19,838
compost and then once that goes into

1346
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,679
your soil like you said in a living soil

1347
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:24,279
system there's so many carbon fractions

1348
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:26,239
in there um from there's a lot of

1349
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,359
soluble carbon a lot of active carbon a

1350
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,038
lot of longer chained inactive carbon

1351
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:32,199
compounds and our compost and our Pete

1352
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:34,760
MTH so a lot of this is just happening

1353
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:36,480
in our living soils naturally um so it's

1354
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,039
not essential to necessarily do that

1355
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,519
because as soon as it hits our soil it's

1356
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:43,079
a giant carbon sponge um but in a top

1357
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,639
soil system I think it makes a lot of

1358
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:47,280
sense especially in fertigation but it

1359
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:48,920
we don't necessarily need to buy bottled

1360
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,359
products that are carbon based because

1361
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,760
we can just add a little humic acid or

1362
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:56,880
fulvic acid or molasses and do it

1363
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,039
ourselves very very cool so last

1364
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,318
question um I know we kind of went over

1365
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:04,799
some of your

1366
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:06,038
favorite nitrogen inputs already and how

1367
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:07,199
you like to have multiple sources we

1368
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:10,440
talked a little about your favorite

1369
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:12,118
calcium inputs can you just give me and

1370
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,318
I don't want to you know dive too deep

1371
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,920
into this but just some of your favorite

1372
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:20,679
uh

1373
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,039
phosphorus and um magnesium I mean well

1374
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:23,480
I already know the one for magnesium but

1375
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:25,880
go ahead yeah just some of your other

1376
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,318
major essential nutrient amendments like

1377
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,200
what you like to

1378
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:33,079
use yeah sure so

1379
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:35,838
magnesium

1380
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:39,160
um really I I only think of two one is

1381
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:41,679
Epsom salt and one is lonite and lonite

1382
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,598
I only use when potassium is also needed

1383
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,798
it's kind of a it's kind of a niche use

1384
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:50,079
case honestly um it's probably only

1385
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:53,440
about 10% of my recommendations or less

1386
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:55,760
so when I think plants need magnesium I

1387
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,760
immediately go to Epsom salt and I and I

1388
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,359
immediately go to Epsom salt in foler

1389
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:03,680
that's the first thing I think about

1390
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:06,400
it's complet it's totally inexpensive

1391
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:08,199
and it's super effective in foler and so

1392
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,880
the first thing I do is I hit my plants

1393
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:13,279
with a with an Epsom salt foler and if

1394
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,039
they respond positively it usually is an

1395
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,798
indicator that indeed they're low in

1396
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,520
magnesium and then only then I would

1397
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:22,480
think about a soil dredge

1398
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,880
um yeah that I think that covers mag

1399
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,960
magnesium pretty well I like to run

1400
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,880
magesium on the low side so I do think

1401
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,960
Growers I work would tend to see

1402
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,039
magnesium hunger because I like to just

1403
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,480
run it kind of on the lower end of the

1404
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:39,359
spectrum uh because I like to Max

1405
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,798
maximize calcium and potassium uptake um

1406
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,519
and it's so easy to feed that I don't

1407
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:45,519
necessarily want to load my slow with

1408
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,280
magnesium it's better to keep it low and

1409
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:49,759
apply it as needed I do I have found

1410
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,599
that different strains vary pretty

1411
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,280
widely in their magnesium requirements

1412
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:57,079
so some of them just just get hungry for

1413
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,798
it kind of like a tomato Tomatoes like

1414
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:02,760
it um what were you going to say oh I

1415
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:06,759
just want to add that I rarely see

1416
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,720
magnesium deficiencies on living soils

1417
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,200
where you know if you have if you're

1418
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,439
mixing a living soil you don't need to

1419
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:15,038
add a magnesium input you're probably

1420
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,920
getting enough magnesium from your

1421
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:20,400
compost and other inputs um I would just

1422
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,720
hesit I I would not add magnesium unless

1423
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,200
you have a test showing you need

1424
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,838
magnesium because it has a lot of

1425
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,199
antagonisms like you kind of alluded to

1426
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:29,798
there um it's going to it's going to

1427
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:31,239
typically raise your pH with most of the

1428
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:33,798
things you're going to add for it and

1429
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:35,279
it's going to potentially tighten soil

1430
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:37,519
not really the same thing in living

1431
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,798
soils but just something that I want to

1432
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:42,000
caution users about it's much easier to

1433
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:44,079
add more you can't really remove it very

1434
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,239
effectively yeah I would I would add to

1435
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,240
what you're saying just to to say that I

1436
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,199
I

1437
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:52,679
would I think I probably see excess

1438
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:56,759
magnesium five to 10 times more

1439
00:58:52,679 --> 00:59:00,598
frequently than I see uh uh deficiency

1440
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:04,079
of magnesium so I'm way more common in

1441
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:06,838
my recommending Growers leech excess

1442
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,160
magnesium out of their soil and stop the

1443
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:13,119
use of all magnesium inputs then I am

1444
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:16,239
seeing a deficiency um I want to add

1445
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:19,000
though oh sorry with certain LED lights

1446
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:22,118
I do sometimes seem to see uh more

1447
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,159
magnesium hunger in certain cultivars

1448
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:25,960
and I haven't found an exact correlation

1449
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,679
there the first time I heard that I

1450
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,679
didn't believe it but um I'm at the

1451
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:32,598
point now where I'm starting to see a

1452
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:34,798
lot more of this anecdotally and I think

1453
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:39,359
it I think it's really a thing that's

1454
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:42,358
interesting yeah yeah I mean I I I

1455
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:44,880
see yeah I I do think magnesium hunger

1456
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,679
is quite common visually um and that's

1457
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,000
why I like that foler application I I I

1458
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:54,759
believe that works really really well in

1459
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,400
in addressing light magnesium hunger um

1460
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,680
um but yeah the LED thing is interesting

1461
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,760
i' I I

1462
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,519
haven't I don't have much experience

1463
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,160
with

1464
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,038
that or I haven't noticed that at least

1465
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,199
so it's good to it's good to think about

1466
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:11,039
that I wonder how that would be I think

1467
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,639
it's a spectral thing or maybe it's

1468
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,920
related somehow I don't think it has

1469
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:17,000
related to temperature but those are the

1470
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,920
only two big differences between LED

1471
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,920
lights and uh other light sources is you

1472
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:25,318
get less uh Leaf less rays and leaf

1473
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,960
surface temperature and potentially a

1474
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:31,159
slightly different Spectrum interesting

1475
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,720
yeah fascinating um I'm sure I have more

1476
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:34,719
thoughts on magnesium but let's let's

1477
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:37,318
move on to

1478
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:42,598
phosphorus in

1479
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:46,558
In Living soil I really like to get most

1480
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:48,760
or all of my phosphorus in the soil

1481
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,240
ahead of the cycle through Dry

1482
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,640
amendments I think that's the the best

1483
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:55,199
way to do it I mean everything's going

1484
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,598
to bring in some phosphorus depending on

1485
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,480
your compost Source that's going to

1486
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,720
provide quite a bit again slowly

1487
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,159
mineralizing over time and then

1488
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,038
otherwise my go-tos are bone meal and

1489
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:08,480
softrock phosphate I used to recommend a

1490
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:10,839
lot of fish bone meal but um which has a

1491
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,798
percent higher nitrogen than bone meal

1492
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:17,519
much better micronutrients but higher

1493
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:19,480
sodium so I like to and and actually a

1494
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:22,119
little bit less phosphorus so you're

1495
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:24,240
getting more sodium more micronutrients

1496
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:26,240
and more nitrogen per unit of phosphorus

1497
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,879
so I just go with bone meal it's a

1498
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:32,719
little cleaner um in that in that

1499
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,760
sense and and heavy metals is also a

1500
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,558
consideration there um I haven't seen

1501
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,280
High heavy metal levels in really any

1502
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,680
bone meal

1503
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,160
so I like to have really sort of luxury

1504
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:48,399
levels of of organically bound

1505
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:49,159
phosphorus in in my soil at the time of

1506
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,559
of

1507
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:54,598
transplant but there's two sources I can

1508
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,680
think about organic sources of liquid

1509
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,079
phosphorus if you want to feed

1510
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,838
additional phosphorus one is a high

1511
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,960
phosphorous fish and it is a brand name

1512
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:04,599
it's called sea fos

1513
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,119
um and I still don't know how it's

1514
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:07,559
allowed in organic production because

1515
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:09,160
instead of stabilizing the fish with

1516
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:12,240
sulfuric acid they stabilize it with

1517
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:14,759
phosphoric acid and that pushes that

1518
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:19,000
that uh phosphorus phosphate number up

1519
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,680
to 7% so that's a really good tool in

1520
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,199
the toolbox and the other thing I can

1521
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,118
think of which is a little bit new this

1522
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:30,159
is another update I've been testing tons

1523
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:33,880
of jadam and KF inputs so

1524
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:35,480
um f you know ferments

1525
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,278
and

1526
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:41,159
uh yeah primar I guess primarily

1527
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:44,000
ferments jlf but just different plant

1528
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:46,399
juices and the one Trend across the

1529
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,318
board is that soluble phosphorus is

1530
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,240
really high in um fermented plant juices

1531
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:54,199
which is very interesting so I don't

1532
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:57,719
recommend it I don't use it but it is it

1533
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:59,960
is is a use case for these um ferments

1534
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:02,318
is they're able to liberate quite a bit

1535
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,079
of phosphorus I would say the other

1536
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:06,639
nutrient levels are

1537
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,119
are somewhat underwhelming once you

1538
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:12,838
dilute them to their recommended

1539
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:15,519
dilution rates um but phosphorus can be

1540
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:18,358
you know somewhere like 60 parts per

1541
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:20,920
million in some of these um fermented

1542
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:22,798
plant juices so yeah I think that's sort

1543
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,639
of interesting to mention I've seen

1544
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:28,838
cannabis jlf concentrate that tests at

1545
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:30,358
27 parts per million of phosphorus now

1546
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,960
all of these levels are going to depend

1547
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:36,078
on the nutrient status of the plant

1548
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:39,358
being used in the ferment um but that's

1549
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:43,240
significant so if you diluted that at

1550
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:45,519
let's say 1 to 20 you'd have a a a

1551
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:47,639
pretty healthy phosphorus application

1552
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,719
that's soluble but all this can be a

1553
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:53,400
little bit of a moot point in the sense

1554
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:55,118
that Tad you still there sorry everyone

1555
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,798
this is when my internet cutout I was

1556
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,160
really looking forward to this

1557
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:02,038
discussion and I wanted to share some of

1558
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:04,399
my feedback on uh ferment tests that

1559
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:06,240
I've gotten back from Growers uh

1560
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,798
actually showing pretty high chlorides

1561
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:11,879
and sodium so um maybe that's something

1562
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:13,798
that we can dive into together in a

1563
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,798
later conversation or possibly on

1564
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:17,880
Instagram live or YouTube live but um

1565
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,599
I'll definitely be following up with

1566
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,000
Bryant and I really appreciated this
