1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,400
hey guys so I want to share something

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:07,119
new we've been working on in the

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,599
background we've been working with a

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,039
grower who is in a very tight state for

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,118
uh standards and so they've been

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,079
independently testing a ton of inputs

7
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:21,320
not just from our company but from other

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,439
providers as well um I'm only here to

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,320
share the results from the ones from all

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,800
the products that we carry but really

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,039
important to try and get test results

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,359
and keep in mind too with these test

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,640
results they're going to vary a little

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,320
bit so this is just going to give you a

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,799
rough idea what's in the product but

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,119
this type of test that they're running

17
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:40,439
here is an icpms test it's a very

18
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,759
accurate way of finding out exactly

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,199
what's in a product you can see here

20
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,878
like with arsenic it's in the parts per

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,960
billion is how they're reporting it and

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,439
in parts per million so11 parts per

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,120
million is quite low that's a very good

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,959
number to see um and you can see here on

25
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,238
the lead 311 so it's a pretty clean

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,198
product from a heavy metal perspective

27
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,599
uh which is great and we don't have this

28
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:05,679
for every product but for all the

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,759
products we do have uh you can just go

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,400
on our website right now and check it

31
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,000
out and see what those numbers look like

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,400
so you can better manage your heavy

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,920
metals keep in mind that pretty much

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,840
every product is going to have some

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,159
level of heavy metals some are going to

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
be higher than others so you could

37
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,799
absolutely make a better choice in

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,079
regards to certain things like rock dust

39
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,200
or soft rock phosphate for example by

40
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:29,919
choosing the one that's going to be

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,159
lower in heavy metals same with gypsum

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,719
we actually have two different types of

43
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,479
gypsum we're going to be updating our

44
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,039
page with both a granulated and a

45
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,759
powdered gypsum from two different

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,399
companies with two different heavy metal

47
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,599
tests and you'll be able to go over here

48
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,680
and select which one you want um so yeah

49
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,359
I hope that folks find this helpful and

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,399
uh one other thing I want to point out

51
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,599
while I'm doing this is so we got these

52
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,200
tests originally from Delta Urban soils

53
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,399
lab they're an xrf test um they're very

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,719
affordable way of testing but one thing

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,118
to look at here is this detection limit

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,679
you can see here it has arsenic at 7 for

57
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,800
example that means if arsenic is below 7

58
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,239
PPM on these worm castings it's going to

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,800
give us a lower than detection limit or

60
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,560
or null result here um Seven's pretty

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,319
high though for what we're doing and so

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,759
like I just got a recent test and we'll

63
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:24,079
add this to the website too um you can

64
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,280
see here that the actual castings arenic

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,560
levels were

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,360
2.4 using icpms which again is going to

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,199
be um a much

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,319
more accurate way of testing so uh just

69
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,359
something to be aware of if you're

70
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,079
looking on our test always be sure to

71
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,120
check or any test really be sure to

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,319
check what the detection limits are on

73
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,480
the product or on the testing to make

74
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,079
sure that you can actually um test it to

75
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,560
the levels you want and while we're

76
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,959
talking about heavy metals I just want

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,640
to mention with water you need very very

78
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,360
good detection limits because a lot of

79
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,119
times the water tests are not detected

80
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,560
to the level that we need them to in a

81
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,719
commercial facility to make sure that

82
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,439
we're not bringing in Arsenic or lead or

83
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,719
cadm or something like that in our water

84
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,598
supply so hope folks find this helpful

85
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,479
it's a free resource uh it's on our

86
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,839
website and you know we list the brands

87
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,639
for a lot of these products like right

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
here it'll say Cascade minerals B salt

89
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:19,000
so if you can find this product locally

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,840
you'll have uh up-to-date independent

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,439
heavy metals test to go along with it

92
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,439
all right thanks guys
