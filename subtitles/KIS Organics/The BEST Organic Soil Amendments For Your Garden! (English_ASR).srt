1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,000
hey guys Tad here with kiss Organics and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,799
today I want to talk to you about

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,638
organic amendments and organic inputs

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,559
what I have in front of me here is the

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,919
uh majority of things that you'll find

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,679
in organic fertilizers I'm going to talk

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,879
about each one sort of off the cuff I'm

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,079
not reading a script so I may not catch

9
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:25,000
all the bullet points that I want to but

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,919
I will try and add any notes as well as

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the actual NPK uh the nitrogen

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,640
phosphorus and potassium of the various

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
products that I'm talking about I'll add

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,399
those to the video uh later because I

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,558
don't have those all memorized so I'm

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,799
just going to I'm just going to run

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,280
through them I'm this is going to be one

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,199
really long form video I'm going to try

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,200
and bookmark the different spots so you

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,160
can look up particular amendments if

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,559
you're curious about them uh and

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,279
initially what I have out right now is

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,198
all things that contain uh NPK so these

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,280
are going to be your major nutrients

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:01:01,119
I'll do another one with um calcium and

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,280
limes um as well as mic micronutrients

27
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,158
I'll do one on compost and I'll do one

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,519
on some Blended fertilizers so it's a

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,240
lot and I only had so much room in front

30
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,759
of me and a lot of these things look

31
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,478
very similar so bear with me as I try

32
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,280
and go through them now before I do one

33
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,959
of the first things I want you to think

34
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,239
about when you're thinking about organic

35
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:25,078
fertilizers is release rates and one of

36
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,239
the primary variables with release rates

37
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:30,319
is particle size um and solubility so

38
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,919
some of these things are going going to

39
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:37,478
have very large particle size like this

40
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,478
neem seed meal or neem cake versus um I

41
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:41,200
don't know something like this

42
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,438
pottassium sulfate or Epsom salt um

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,118
magnesium sulfate fully soluble in water

44
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,398
um or even if we're talking particle

45
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:51,040
size like this kelp meal is very very

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,599
fine um and I've seen kelp meals come in

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,118
a variety of different um particle sizes

48
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:01,000
so the smaller the particle size the

49
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:03,560
greater the surface area and the easier

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,879
it is for microbes to break them down

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,399
and make them plant available now this

52
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,400
is a this is a very general broad

53
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,560
statement that I'm making there's some

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Nuance to it um there's a lot of

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,598
variables that will come into play like

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,680
what microbes are in your soil uh what

57
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,359
moisture levels are in your soil what

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,800
temperature is your soil uh all those

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,040
things are going to play a role in terms

60
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,879
of nutrient availability but that's the

61
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,919
first thing I look at or think about

62
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,199
when I'm when I'm looking at an organic

63
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,399
Amendment uh before I look at mpk I look

64
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:38,479
at particle size so keep that in mind

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,519
but let's start off talking about uh

66
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:45,119
primarily nitrogen amendments so what I

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,759
have closest to me here first is organic

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,439
alphalpha now organic Al falam is

69
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,199
something that I like to use in all of

70
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,878
my nitrogen recommendations um it

71
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,158
doesn't contain a lot of nitrogen so

72
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:01,919
you're not getting a lot of um NPK out

73
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:05,318
of it per se but it's a wonderful

74
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,798
microbial food it feeds bacteria archa

75
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,639
fungi uh which in turn will feed

76
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,799
protozoa and other microorganisms so if

77
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,199
you're big on the soil food web thing um

78
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,159
adding organic alala meal is a great

79
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,560
option uh for you just be be careful

80
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,519
because if you add too much um it can

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,400
cause the soil temperature to heat up as

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,959
these as the bacteria reproduce rapidly

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,799
um and that could potentially um pull

84
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,000
nitrogen from your crop roots or um

85
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,239
potentially cause issues uh in that

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,878
regard but in general it's a really good

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
safe amendment to use and something that

88
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:45,598
I like to use in all of my

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,080
Gardens okay moving on so next what I

90
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:53,479
have here um I believe this is the fish

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,560
meal so a fish meal um it's primarily

92
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:59,158
nitrogen it's derived from fish as you

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,519
may as you may know and um it's a fairly

94
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,798
small particle size here it's it's one

95
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,959
of the more expensive nitrogen options

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,438
uh there's nothing wrong with it it's

97
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,878
just you're going to pay more for your

98
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,359
nitrogen if you go with fish meal Some

99
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:16,279
people prefer um ocean-based products

100
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,160
over um things that might have come from

101
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,039
our industrial solder houses and things

102
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,320
like that um but in terms of cleanliness

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,479
of the product um you know heavy metals

104
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,560
um exposure to uh I don't know growth

105
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,758
hormones chemicals things like that um

106
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,160
it's it's not necessarily any cleaner so

107
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,120
keep that in mind because I have heard

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,240
um some some organic um companies

109
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,519
pushing that that sort of message and

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,400
agenda and it just the the science

111
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,000
doesn't back it up so um if you want to

112
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,359
learn more about that you can go and

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,079
take a look at a video I made on exactly

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,600
that topic um I'll try to link to it in

115
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:57,319
the comments but again fish meal

116
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,439
primarily nitrogen um and and so if if

117
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,240
you're if you're looking to make

118
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,918
something that is

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,560
um not using things like blood meal

120
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,639
feather meal that is a good other

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:11,120
nitrogen Source option okay next I have

122
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,038
uh soybean meal so soy meal is um a

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,360
great option for folks who want to

124
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:19,478
create sort of a vegetarian or vegan mix

125
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,560
um or don't want to support our

126
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,639
industrial uh fishery commercial fishing

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,800
or um industrial

128
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,280
slaughterhouse um you know Loops of of

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,720
uh food production for our country so if

130
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:37,000
you do go if you do want to use um only

131
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,840
plant-based inputs that's a great source

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,079
for nitrogen so you could use something

133
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:46,478
like the soy and the alphalpha keep in

134
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:48,918
mind with any of the um

135
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,758
plantbased uh nutrient sources that they

136
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:54,439
can vary based on the fertility of the

137
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,759
soil and how that crop was grown will

138
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,839
impact the fertility of the uh final

139
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,080
product itself so you may see some some

140
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,719
variability there but you can usually

141
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,519
get a prettyy rough idea by looking at

142
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
the label as to what you're actually

143
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,839
getting for nitrogen but just keep in

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,080
mind those labels are not 100% accurate

145
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,318
so if you're using those and purely

146
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,918
those for calculating out what your NPK

147
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,919
is going to be I can tell you right now

148
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,839
it's not going to match up the way you

149
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,598
think it is we always soil test

150
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,598
afterwards and are always shocked with

151
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:26,240
just how different it is when we start

152
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,360
mixing and making soils from um what we

153
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,000
expect using an NPK

154
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,479
calculator okay moving on uh neem cake

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,478
or neem seed meal uh the one that we

156
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,800
have right now this is in the form of a

157
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,719
pellet a compressed pellet but you can

158
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,079
also get it uh at least we've got in the

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,960
past as like a powder uh one of the

160
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,159
things about the neem cake is it is the

161
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:52,279
um it's what the residue that's left

162
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,560
after the seed is pressed to extract the

163
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:58,878
oil so depending on how thoroughly they

164
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:02,079
press the seed uh that will determine um

165
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:05,680
what a a dant content may be left in the

166
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:08,839
neem seed meal and as a duratin is a um

167
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
insect growth regulator um there's

168
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,119
synthetic versions like azamax or

169
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,199
azatrol that you may have heard of some

170
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,879
people like to use neem oil as a

171
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,680
um as an as a foler spray to deal with

172
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,439
various insects um I have used the neem

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,519
seed meal in the past it's been a number

174
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,519
of years now because I think there's

175
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,120
better options out there but I have used

176
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,000
it at a rate of two cups per five

177
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,959
gallons of water that I bubbled for 24

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,279
hours and then watered over the soil to

179
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,478
deal with a really bad fungus snat in

180
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,519
infection that I had at the time or

181
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,519
infestation um so it it can be used for

182
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,198
that um it is going to give you a little

183
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,598
bit of nitrogen but there's a couple

184
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:49,598
reasons why I tend to not use as much uh

185
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,240
neem cake and also the corja cake which

186
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,439
I'll talk about next um and that's sort

187
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,158
of twofold so the first reason and again

188
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,199
all of this goes back to using the cots

189
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,000
mix um and and Clackamus coot uh back in

190
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,478
the

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,639
day but the reasons I moved away from

192
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,318
these and I still use a small amount but

193
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,960
um very small amount compared to what CS

194
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,680
mies was or what I originally used um

195
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,799
and the reason why is one uh the fossil

196
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,319
fuel cost so just to get the product

197
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,478
here um to get the neem cake here from

198
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,000
India is very expensive and it has a

199
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,639
high fossil fuel cost to do so I just

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,399
think there's better nitrogen options um

201
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,079
out here on this table that are more

202
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,439
sustainable because I can Source them

203
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,079
more locally um I did hear there was

204
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,719
going to be some neem production

205
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
happening in Florida which potentially

206
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,200
would be a little closer and again I'm

207
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,399
making this video like you live and our

208
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,200
sourcing things in the United States or

209
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,440
let's say North America um if you live

210
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,920
in India neem cake is a wonderful option

211
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,920
for you for getting nitrogen it's been

212
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,278
used for you know I think hundreds if

213
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:54,519
not thousands of years by Farmers for

214
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:56,159
cultivation um of crops so moving on oh

215
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,120
the second reason and this goes for both

216
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,600
of these sorry is um

217
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,039
from talking to a good friend of mine

218
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:09,519
she was Consulting with a farm in Oregon

219
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:12,439
and they actually failed for um a an his

220
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,360
a pesticide that is a chemistry that has

221
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,760
not been allowed in the United States

222
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,440
since the 1970s and so this Farm was

223
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,278
very confused as to how they could have

224
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,760
failed on their flow for this pesticide

225
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:28,200
and basically what had happened as they

226
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:30,519
tracked it all down was the neem oil

227
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,640
that they were spraying on their crop um

228
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:36,000
contained uh low Trace levels of this

229
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,240
particular pesticide um I don't remember

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,919
what the pesticide was off top of my

231
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,399
head but I know that it's not something

232
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,719
that's been available here in the United

233
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,200
States for you know 40 years now 50

234
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,759
years almost so uh the fact that it was

235
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,600
on the crop pretty much means that the

236
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,200
the farmers that were growing the neem

237
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,200
tree somewhere in that production chain

238
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,320
uh it got exposed to this pesticide so

239
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,879
uh that's something with the um neem

240
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
cake the Kanan cake that's just

241
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,439
something to be aware of as a

242
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,120
possibility and it's one reason to have

243
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,360
a very clean Source but also realize

244
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,759
that you know like I said there's

245
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,360
there's better options we can find here

246
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:17,278
locally um okay moving on this is

247
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,320
probably my favorite Amendment uh right

248
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,799
now that I like to include in all of my

249
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,879
Gardens and all of my soil formulations

250
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,919
and this is insect frass now the great

251
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,278
thing about insect frass well there's a

252
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,639
number of things really um the first one

253
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:35,240
being is it's closing an ecological Loop

254
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:39,278
so a lot of times these uh these meal

255
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,079
worms are eating a waste byproduct uh

256
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,000
and then converting that into grubs

257
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:48,679
which are then sold as a high protein

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,480
source for animal feeds um and then this

259
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,479
fras is sort of is their poop and and

260
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,360
leftover exoskeletons anything that

261
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,360
remains there and the wonderful thing

262
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,079
about insect fras is I have yet to see a

263
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,440
sample um and I've probably looked at

264
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,159
three or four different sources now over

265
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,720
the years and all of them have been very

266
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,240
clean on heavy metals now in addition to

267
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,160
the low heavy metals which is really big

268
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,079
um for those of you that are in

269
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,559
regulated States growing cannabis um but

270
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,078
even for people with our own Gardens

271
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:21,919
just for our own health um having

272
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:25,679
something that's really clean that is a

273
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,078
um has you know uh nitrogen phosphorus

274
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,599
and potassium and it's it's kind of a

275
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:32,719
more balanced fertilizer option um and

276
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,680
then has microbial life in it as well

277
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,839
and because it is a it is an insect

278
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:40,759
manure essentially that's what frass is

279
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:45,040
and it contains high levels of kiten and

280
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:49,078
um so potentially that kiten um could

281
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,799
help with disease resistance um so it's

282
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:54,000
not going to hurt to use it I wouldn't

283
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,759
use it as my main form of uh you know

284
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,078
integrated Pest Management but having it

285
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,799
in your mix is certainly not going to

286
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:01,278
hurt anything and it has all those other

287
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,439
benefits so insect frass one of my

288
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:09,200
favorite amendments right now okay

289
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:14,600
moving on blood meal blood meal is a

290
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,800
very uh fast relase available form of

291
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,120
nitrogen it's kind of gross to work with

292
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,159
um you don't you want to keep it very

293
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,440
dry until you're ready to use it um but

294
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,319
if you need nitrogen it's it's a good

295
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:31,120
way to get a faster release nitrogen um

296
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:34,519
right away and so this goes back to that

297
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,399
whole idea of uh using utilizing

298
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,679
slaughterhouse products um the the

299
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,240
reason you might want to consider it is

300
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,479
because you are closing an ecological

301
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,639
Loop this would be the best use case for

302
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,120
that material is to grow more things

303
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,799
with it rather than ending up in a

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,360
landfill or getting dumped or polluting

305
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,639
our environment by ending up in um you

306
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,759
know um our streams or something our

307
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,799
water supply or something like that so

308
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,240
by extracting and making you know a

309
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,958
fertilizer out of it that's really the

310
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,480
highest use case uh for a product like

311
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,958
this but again I understand if there's

312
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,240
people that don't want to use it now I

313
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,919
have seen research and there's not a ton

314
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,519
of research on this topic unfortunately

315
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,559
but the research that I have seen that

316
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,399
does exist shows that that that the

317
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:22,479
blood meal is actually very clean so it

318
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:25,559
doesn't have high levels of heavy metals

319
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,920
it doesn't have high levels of um any

320
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,439
sort of like growth hormones pesticides

321
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:34,360
uh you name it it's actually a very

322
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,839
clean product um same with the uh bone

323
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,879
meal as well which I'll get to but um

324
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,839
yeah it's definitely something that you

325
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,198
should consider and you also will pick

326
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,880
up a little bit of iron from it too

327
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:47,838
because it is it is actual blood so

328
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:51,360
that's another nitrogen Source um again

329
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,759
I don't use it in my garden uh all that

330
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,639
often but I don't have a problem with

331
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:01,639
people that that do chose choose to use

332
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:02,879
it is a good option um okay moving on so

333
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,198
I have a couple things in here that

334
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,399
aren't necessarily NPK but I had already

335
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,639
poured them into the bucket so I'm going

336
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,600
to talk about them uh this is

337
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,480
agricultural sulfur so agricultural

338
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,519
sulfur it's these little tiny prilled

339
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,839
pellets in this case um you can add it

340
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:23,519
to your soil as a way of lowering your

341
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,680
pH and so if you have a pH above let's

342
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,078
say 73 74 and you need to lower it this

343
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,278
is a good option it's not going to be a

344
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:33,319
immediate it's going to take a little

345
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:35,519
bit of time um so keep that in mind as

346
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,920
well but it is it is a good way to

347
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,198
slowly lower your soil PH in addition to

348
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:46,078
that sulfur is U associated with a lot

349
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:48,359
of uh tarpine production so having

350
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,319
adequate sulfur is really important to

351
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,120
get all

352
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,680
the flavors and and odors that you want

353
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,480
in you know whatever sort of flower that

354
00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:00,078
you're

355
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,920
growing so keep that in mind um and it's

356
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,958
uh it's really hard to get too much

357
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:08,759
sulfur now the only risk with sulfur is

358
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:10,559
raising the EC the electrical

359
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,159
conductivity of your soil so high that

360
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:16,919
you may put osmotic pressure on uh your

361
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,198
your plant roots but you're not going to

362
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,000
um you're not going to see a sulfur

363
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:22,758
toxicity in cannabis it's very um

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,278
tolerant of high sulfur so I don't

365
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:28,600
usually worry about that um next and

366
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:32,000
again this one I I kind of poured it out

367
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,360
before I decided to do primarily NPK but

368
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,759
I'm I'm going to leave it in here this

369
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,519
is biochar so talking about

370
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,839
biochar it is uh one of my favorite

371
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,399
amendments it's right up there with

372
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,959
insect frass I include it in all of my

373
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,679
soil formulations and the reasons why

374
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:53,559
are because it it has a ton of benefits

375
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:57,000
it's going to sequester carbon it um it

376
00:15:53,559 --> 00:16:00,318
helps with overall plant growth and

377
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,639
yield it's Habitat for micro probes it

378
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:05,679
sequesters heavy metals it does just a

379
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,079
ton of really great things and we found

380
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:12,278
that using it at a rate of about five to

381
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,559
eight% by volume we see uh just we see

382
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,958
better growth in yield and I was kind of

383
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,599
surprised by this I didn't expect to see

384
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,278
such a dramatic Difference by such a

385
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,199
small addition but I the the research

386
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,600
really supports it and one thing to keep

387
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:27,318
in mind and this is something I'll talk

388
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,278
more in depth about when I talk about

389
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:33,719
compost but not all biochars created

390
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,559
equal and so you want to make sure that

391
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,959
you're sourcing it from a company that's

392
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,559
that's Burning uh clean wood and

393
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:43,439
actually pying that material that means

394
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,239
burning it at very very high heat and

395
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,839
low oxygen conditions otherwise what

396
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,440
you're ending up with is something more

397
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,600
like ash that can contain heavy metals

398
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,519
and other contaminants so having a very

399
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,959
uh consistent clean source is super

400
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,399
important and then particle size plays a

401
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,919
big role too like I talked about with

402
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,839
surface areas so having some smaller

403
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,678
particle sizes it can act act as an

404
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,439
aggregate in your soil and give you your

405
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,679
soil more tilth more texture um so the

406
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,038
one the size that we use is is fairly

407
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,439
small it's not a um powder it's probably

408
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,519
um I would say the size of like a maybe

409
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,480
like a grain of rice to give you sort of

410
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:27,318
a a size

411
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:31,679
analogy okay moving on here let's

412
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:36,000
see believe this this is feather

413
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,519
meal uh the feather meal is sourced from

414
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,798
um as you can expect from the poultry

415
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:44,798
industry uh feather meal can

416
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:47,879
contain uh more contaminants than these

417
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,918
than the bone or the blood but in

418
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,000
general is another great option for

419
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,159
nitrogen sources um I IID originally

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,038
read that that feather meal was a slow

421
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,880
release nitrogen Source but what I'm

422
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,240
finding in practice with soil testing

423
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,919
things like that is uh it comes down

424
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,480
more to particle size at least in this

425
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,679
case so um yeah again it's just it's

426
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,759
primarily nitrogen and there are other

427
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,120
options if you choose not to use you

428
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:15,440
know anything from the uh uh

429
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,000
slaughterhouse

430
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:24,240
industry okay let's see

431
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:27,558
here this is uh crab or crustation meal

432
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,200
and crab en crustation meal is a good

433
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,240
source of nitrogen as as well it's also

434
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,600
going to contain high levels of kiten

435
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,519
from the shells that's in there it's

436
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,759
going to contain some more calcium for

437
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,480
the same reason and I haven't talked

438
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,400
about calcium you will get some calcium

439
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,880
from the insect frass uh as well and

440
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,038
just to go back to the insect fras

441
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,960
depending on what insect it was you know

442
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,960
whether it was mealworm or black soldier

443
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,880
fly um I think there's even a Cricut

444
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,360
frass that can be it's commercially

445
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,200
available now they're all going to be

446
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,119
slightly different NPK slightly

447
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,880
different um microbial consortia

448
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,719
different calcium levels those sorts of

449
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,600
things but um yeah keep that in mind so

450
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,600
anyway getting back to the crustation

451
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,959
meal this is going to be a combination

452
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,158
of a variety of different crustations

453
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,640
typically um crab Lobster those sorts of

454
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,600
things and it's just ground up and so

455
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,919
you can add this to your soil again

456
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:25,719
primarily for

457
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:29,799
nitrogen okay kelp meal what we have

458
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,640
here now kelp meal is an interesting one

459
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:35,359
because it has a ton of plant benefits

460
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,240
there's a lot of great research on how

461
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,558
wonderful kelp meal is for plant growth

462
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,839
and plant Health um it

463
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,720
contains like 70 different elements in

464
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,000
it it's pretty phenomenal it's just kelp

465
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,919
is this amazing Dynamic accumulator now

466
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,038
because it is so good at

467
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,320
accumulating nutrients uh primarily

468
00:19:54,038 --> 00:20:00,200
micronutrients um it is also high in

469
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:04,000
heavy metals primarily arsenic from what

470
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,600
I've seen on tests so uh you can use it

471
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,240
I like to use it at lower rates now um

472
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,038
especially for people in states where

473
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,159
heavy metals is a

474
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,440
concern but um if we just look at it

475
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,360
from a plant growth perspective it is a

476
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,798
wonderful input and something to use in

477
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,199
your soil so just keep that in mind um

478
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,639
if you do use it you can use it at

479
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,080
pretty low rates you don't necessarily

480
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,880
need to use the high rates that we

481
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,519
originally were using when we were

482
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,760
making Coots mix

483
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:39,240
okay this next one is uh known as keg or

484
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:41,158
suo or sufate of potach magnesia uh it

485
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,480
has a bunch of different names it's

486
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,919
going to be very high in Sulfur

487
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,120
pottassium and magnesium and it's not

488
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,520
going to be in the right ratios for what

489
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,399
you want of those elements so keep all

490
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,519
of that in mind if you decide to use it

491
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,038
there are rare use cases where I might

492
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,440
use it but I don't use it all that

493
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:03,440
frequently um typically and the reason

494
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,519
for this is because I have access to

495
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,440
things like potassium sulfate and

496
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,960
magnesium sulfate uh Epsom salt which

497
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,880
are both very very affordable and I can

498
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,679
control the levels of potassium and

499
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,200
magnesium I'm adding separately it's

500
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,720
kind of like using caleg like I would

501
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,200
never use caleg because I'd want to add

502
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,640
calcium and magnesium separately and it

503
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,519
different ratios depending on what what

504
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,640
my soil report or what my plant may need

505
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:32,599
so it's the same sort of thing with so p

506
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,038
Meg or keg um that being said you know

507
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,480
if you do need to pick up some potassium

508
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,319
and a little bit more on the magnesium

509
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,159
side then uh it is a good option for you

510
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:44,359
so just keep that in mind the one other

511
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,600
thing about it is it's very soluble

512
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,399
which I like so you will get a faster

513
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:52,599
release rate with it and with these

514
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,240
particular amendments um particularly

515
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:56,798
anything that's a sulfate here like

516
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,000
these they are refined but they are

517
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,119
approved for use in organic production

518
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,200
so something like the potassium sulfate

519
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,798
it's a these are mined products that are

520
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,558
then refined and then allowed to be used

521
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,400
if you have a soil test showing a

522
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,519
deficiency so really all of these

523
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,720
products to a certain extent have some

524
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,038
level of processing or refinement that

525
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,480
happens in order to get to the final

526
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,278
product you know in this case it's

527
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,519
pelletized in these case they're made

528
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,839
into meals um so just keep that in mind

529
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,918
when you're thinking about an amendment

530
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,079
and deciding whether or not you want to

531
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:33,400
use something in your garden so next we

532
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:38,199
have potassium sulfate this is uh 0050

533
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,038
it's 50% potassium um really easy way to

534
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,558
get available potassium and that's so

535
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:44,679
important um mid to late flour that's

536
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:46,558
what's really going to bulk up your

537
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,360
flower give you that nice density that

538
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,399
you want you know I see these um PK

539
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,879
boosters and stuff on the market in the

540
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,759
Cannabis industry and I think a lot of

541
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,039
that really probably comes down to um

542
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:02,038
people having inadequate calcium

543
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,200
uh either from overwatering because it's

544
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,679
highly leech so if you're if you're

545
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,360
flushing your soils and Watering your

546
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,159
soils to run off a lot you could be

547
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,558
removing nitrates and potassium and so

548
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,000
later in flour um you may need to add

549
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,119
some more or it's just one of those

550
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,558
things that you're plant is is utilizing

551
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,719
it at a fairly high level and so you

552
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:20,359
want to make sure you always have

553
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,839
adequate potassium in there and this is

554
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,519
one of the easiest ways to get it in

555
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,240
organic system is through uh potassium

556
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,679
sulfate so week three is a nice time to

557
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,000
do a light potassium sulfate application

558
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,880
and that would just be mixed with water

559
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,319
and watered in um and it's pennies so

560
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,600
it's very affordable

561
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,798
input next we have uh magnesium sulfate

562
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:42,918
or Epsom

563
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:45,918
salts uh rarely do I need to add

564
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,919
magnesium I find with most uh living

565
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:53,400
soils we have adequate magnesium already

566
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,080
um but if I ever do see as Soul report

567
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,480
or need to add it um Epsom salt is the

568
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,319
easiest way to do it because it's very

569
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,759
soluble I can just water it in I'm not

570
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,639
using very much um and it's it's very

571
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,240
easy to source so it's a wonderful

572
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,559
option for you if you do need to pick up

573
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,798
magnesium in your

574
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:18,440
garden okay moving on so I

575
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:20,759
did this was crab meal you know this one

576
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,558
oh this is fishbone meal sorry they look

577
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,278
very similar here and I put them all out

578
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,798
and I didn't label them so I'm I'm

579
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:29,880
trying to test myself to see if I can do

580
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,119
it all visually fishbone meal is a uh

581
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,278
again it's from the commercial fishing

582
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,918
industry it's um it's high in phosphorus

583
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,839
but you're also picking up some nitrogen

584
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:44,480
with it so um you you want to just be

585
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:47,038
aware of that uh with the the phosphor

586
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,159
the phosphate in it um it's it's a good

587
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,359
way to pick a phosphorus uh it's not

588
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,240
perfectly clean on heavy metal tests

589
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:58,398
from what we've seen so um unfortunately

590
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,798
there really is not a perfect

591
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:03,558
phosphorous source that either isn't

592
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,720
going to give you calcium or potentially

593
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,038
um bring in some heavy metals so just

594
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,399
keep that in mind now there's certainly

595
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:11,599
ones that are cleaner than others and

596
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:13,278
there's one that I'm getting tested

597
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,480
right now that I'm super excited about

598
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,679
that may actually be the Holy Grail of

599
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,558
phosphorus inputs uh that's derived from

600
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,120
algae but I haven't gotten the test back

601
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,599
yet I'll keep you guys posted um in the

602
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:27,639
meantime we do like to use fishbone meal

603
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:31,000
so your options for phosphorus in

604
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,440
organic system are fishbone meal bone

605
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,159
meal and softrock phosphate those are

606
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,120
going to be your main sources um and

607
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,559
I'll I'll talk about the other two next

608
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:44,319
here um but yeah fishbone meal again

609
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:46,639
sourc from the ocean not as clean as uh

610
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,038
some people may make it out to be

611
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,000
actually I think the bone meal is

612
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:52,798
actually cleaner when we talk about

613
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
heavy metals and we talk about

614
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,359
um uh you know things like um growth

615
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,359
hormones the pesticides fungicides all

616
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,398
those things it's not in the bone meal

617
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,240
um so you don't have to worry about

618
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:06,519
there's no GMOs making it into the bone

619
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,278
meal um there's research that shows that

620
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:10,918
doesn't happen so uh things from the

621
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,159
ocean not necessarily cleaner than

622
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,679
things from the land if we're talking

623
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:18,600
about products like this now manures on

624
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,600
the other hand and compost absolutely

625
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,199
you're going to see higher levels of

626
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:25,038
contaminants in those so we'll get we'll

627
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,319
get to that but bone meal was the next

628
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:31,278
one this is it here uh one concern that

629
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:34,079
people have with bone meal is mad cow's

630
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,880
disease uh really hasn't been an issue

631
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,599
but it is a preon it's

632
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,760
um it is something where I just if I am

633
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,759
using well any of these amendments I'm G

634
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:47,839
to wear a mask and wash my hands and

635
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:49,960
things like that but um the the statist

636
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,639
statistically it's there you know you're

637
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,399
more likely to get in trouble driving

638
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,360
your car or doing your daily task than

639
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:56,839
you would from that but that is some one

640
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,079
fear I've heard associated with bone

641
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,278
meal so I just wanted to bring it up

642
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,960
um so yeah we have bone meal fishbone

643
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:08,240
meal and then lastly softrock phosphate

644
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,798
now softrock phosphate is a Min product

645
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,000
and so um it is going to contain higher

646
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:16,960
levels of heavy metals so keep that in

647
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,880
mind um this particular one that I have

648
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,840
here is calos it's one of the cleaner

649
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,000
soft rock phosphates that I've seen it

650
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,359
is a larger um particle size here so the

651
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,839
availability is going to be a little bit

652
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:31,038
slower so we usually use a combination

653
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:33,278
of the fishbone and the um softrock the

654
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:36,119
cow fos in our mixes there are other

655
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,200
ones like for trell that we've tested

656
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:40,879
and um they have higher levels of heavy

657
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,798
metals so we primarily recommend the

658
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,360
ones that we found or have lower levels

659
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:49,960
of heavy metals if that makes sense so

660
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:53,319
that's that's sort of the overview of

661
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,919
NPA and again this is not exhaustive

662
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,000
this isn't have everything but this is

663
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,320
the majority of what you'll see in in

664
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,200
your um amendments so I'm going to clear

665
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,599
these out I'm going to replace them with

666
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,759
some other amendments and I'm going to

667
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:08,000
continue the video here shortly all

668
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,158
right I'm back and I've got a new set of

669
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,599
amendments laid out here but I want to

670
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,760
start off talking about limes now

671
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,879
because limes all look relatively the

672
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,200
same uh I didn't bother putting them out

673
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,840
it just look like a whole bunch of white

674
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,440
flower laying out here but I want to

675
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,798
talk about the differences because it's

676
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,080
really important to get the right lime

677
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,839
or the right calcium Amendment into your

678
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,439
soil for the effect that you're looking

679
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,639
for so the the first one I want to talk

680
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,720
about is agricultural lime now

681
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,440
agricultural lime is great if you want

682
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,278
to raise your soil PH it's primarily

683
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,320
calcium carbonate so um it will have a

684
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:47,798
dramatic impact on soil PH um so if

685
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,720
you're low this is the way to go and

686
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:51,639
again the ones that we like to use are a

687
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,399
very very fine flow that's going to

688
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,200
impact your release rates but you could

689
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,119
consider using different particle sizes

690
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,840
to get different release rates on the

691
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,000
calcium but calcium is one of the most

692
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,798
important things to preload and have

693
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,759
high levels through veg and flour um so

694
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:11,079
that's agricultural

695
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:14,000
lime next I have Dolomite lime now

696
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:17,359
Dolomite lime is calcium and

697
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,919
magnesium uh carbonate so what this does

698
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:23,278
is this is going to have uh an even

699
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,240
greater effect on raising soil PH but in

700
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,759
addition to that it's going to provide

701
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,200
you with magnesium now what I found is

702
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:32,839
in most cases when you're mixing soils

703
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,080
you have adequate magnesium and you

704
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:38,278
don't need to add it so I rarely use

705
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,319
Dolomite lme because I prefer again I

706
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:42,079
think I talked about this before but I

707
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,839
prefer to add my magnesium and my

708
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,879
calcium as separate amendments um and in

709
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,319
the correct ratios that I'm aiming for

710
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,799
and and Dolomite does not do that so

711
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,480
there are some rare cases where we might

712
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,759
use Dolomite rot lime if we need to

713
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,960
raise soil PH add calcium and magnesium

714
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,278
um then it is a viable a viable option

715
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,720
but other than that it's not a terribly

716
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,720
popular amendment that I like to use a

717
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:12,278
lot so one of the next and one of my

718
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,679
favorite calcium amendments is gypsum

719
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:17,480
also known as calcium sulfate so the

720
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,360
great thing about gypsum is it buffers

721
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,200
soil PH and that it's not going to have

722
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,519
a dramatic impact on it so the calcium

723
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,840
being a cation and the sulfur being an

724
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,000
annion they offset each other and you

725
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,439
end up with a relatively neutral um

726
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,159
impact on your overall soil PH so why is

727
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,600
this important well if your soil pH is

728
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,840
already 68 to 72 let's say and you don't

729
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,439
want to go any higher then you can add

730
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:48,240
Gypsum to your soil to get more calcium

731
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
in there um and the nice thing about it

732
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,359
also is the fact you're also picking up

733
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:55,158
sulfur and you really don't have to

734
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:57,319
worry too much about a sulfur toxicity

735
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,440
the other cool thing about gypsum is the

736
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,599
solubility ility level of it frankly

737
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,759
it's just not terribly soluble so the

738
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:07,398
solubility of it the release rate of

739
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:09,398
gypsum is is relatively slow meaning

740
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:11,119
it's going to give you pretty optimal

741
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:13,158
release rates of calcium throughout the

742
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,319
growth cycle so if you're starting out

743
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,080
and mixing a soil and you're starting

744
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:18,960
with Pete Moss for example that has a

745
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,199
very low PH you'll typically add

746
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,880
something like the egg lime and the

747
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,440
gypsum so you get different forms of

748
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,440
calcium in there this is going to raise

749
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,720
your pH this is going to not raise your

750
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,440
pH but give you release of of calcium

751
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,960
throughout the entire cycle so those

752
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,720
work well now some people have been have

753
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,120
recommended using oyster shell flour uh

754
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,038
it looks very similar to the

755
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,398
agricultural lime and frankly the gypsum

756
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:50,919
the the difference there is it's derived

757
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:53,918
from oyster shells but it's also a mined

758
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,240
product these are these are bed deposits

759
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,600
that are mined it's not like they're

760
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,319
pulling this out of the ocean and

761
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,319
getting you like the oyster shell flakes

762
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,398
that you might have used if you had

763
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,759
chickens for example so it's also

764
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:09,518
primarily just calcium carbonate as well

765
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,638
with a little bit of impurities so um if

766
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,319
you cannot find agricultural lime

767
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,798
affordably then this is a good

768
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:16,960
alternative for you but I wouldn't go

769
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,359
out of my way to try and find oyster

770
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,880
shell flour to replace agricultural lime

771
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,240
as they're going to have very similar

772
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,200
effects again it's going to raise soil

773
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,200
PH and provide you with high levels of

774
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,200
calcium

775
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,720
and then lastly here I have W asite

776
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,319
that's calcium silicate now well last

777
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,399
night's a little bit harder to find for

778
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,879
folks but if you are able to find it

779
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,319
it's a wonderful option and something I

780
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,600
definitely like to include so if I was

781
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:50,759
formulating an ideal soil mix I would

782
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:53,918
use a combination of

783
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,480
gypsum and will last T night with

784
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,200
probably a little bit of agricultural

785
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,919
lime now the big difference here is

786
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,519
you're getting silica which has a ton of

787
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:07,360
plant benefits I know I've talked about

788
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:09,638
in the past um it it really is the U

789
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,038
magical um nutrient element when it

790
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:13,879
comes to growing plants silica helps

791
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:16,398
with drought stress it helps with

792
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,919
disease resistance it helps with thicker

793
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:22,839
cellular um thicker cell walls it helps

794
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,278
mitigate uh micronutrient toxicities if

795
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,759
you have a little too much Boron or a

796
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:28,440
little bit too much manganese in your

797
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:31,079
soil it it just has so many different

798
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,000
benefits um for plants now all that

799
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:37,558
being said um calcium silicate will give

800
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,839
you that calcium and also silica so it's

801
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,879
a wonderful option now it does raise

802
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:45,519
soil PH but much slower than

803
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,519
agricultural lime so if I have a soil

804
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,159
test that shows a very low soil PH let's

805
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,679
say it's like five five or six and I'm

806
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,919
like wow I got to get this up uh before

807
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,480
you know right away for this next cycle

808
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm not going to use W last night I'll

809
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,120
use agricultural lime or oyster shell

810
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,398
flower is something that's going to

811
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:04,199
raise my pH much faster but if your sole

812
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,599
pH is close to being in range you just

813
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,398
want a little bit of upward pressure on

814
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,598
your pH then W Las andite is a wonderful

815
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,000
wonderful option to consider so those

816
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,760
are your

817
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,800
limes uh Let's

818
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,480
do let's talk compost next so not all

819
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,440
composts are create equal I could do a

820
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,719
whole thing on compost you know let me

821
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,960
know in the comments below if that's

822
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,358
something that people are interested in

823
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,639
but um

824
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:33,199
the way the compost is made what the

825
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,159
feed stock is how that compost is

826
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,678
treated can have dramatic impacts on the

827
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,559
biological and chemical and physical

828
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,440
properties of that compost so there's a

829
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,838
lot of different types of compost um out

830
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,838
there you'll see you'll see different

831
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,239
ways of making it the main three forms

832
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,759
of compost are static composting that's

833
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,439
where you throw stuff in a pile and let

834
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,280
it sit for a year or two and it just

835
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,280
breaks down slowly the advantage of that

836
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,119
very little labor the dis Advantage it's

837
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,599
not going to kill off weed seeds it's

838
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,838
not going to kill off pathogens uh the

839
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,160
next option is vermac composting or worm

840
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:09,039
castings and I show you some examples of

841
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:11,440
those here and I'll put them up on the

842
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,838
screen here superseded over the video

843
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,559
hopefully so you guys can see some

844
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,440
close-ups of what I'm talking about but

845
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,679
um worm casting is where you use worms

846
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,800
to break down the M material it's called

847
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:25,279
vermiculture or vermac compost uh the

848
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,839
castings is essentially Worm poop and

849
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,000
those tend to be some of the highest

850
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:31,239
quality from a biological perspective

851
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,880
worms are just very good at breaking

852
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:36,319
things down into a very plant available

853
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,640
and plant friendly uh

854
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:43,800
forms but the last form oh and I want to

855
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:45,838
mention that worm castings do not um

856
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,760
they do not kill weed seeds and they do

857
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:52,559
not kill um pathogens so the one option

858
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,560
that does do those things is

859
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,599
thermophilic composting or thermal

860
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,279
composting that's where you heat a

861
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:03,200
compost um up by balancing the carbon

862
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,920
and nitrogen ratios to 161 degrees for

863
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:10,118
48 hours and then um well sorry above

864
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,119
141 degrees but below 165 I believe is

865
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:15,720
the um current standards for composting

866
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,160
and that thermal process and turning the

867
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,838
pile will allow for the aerobic

868
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,679
microorganisms to create this exothermic

869
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,078
reaction it heats up the pile as they

870
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,078
reproduce rapidly and that kills off the

871
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,680
weed seeds and kills off the pathogens

872
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,680
in there so so

873
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,399
optimally and it's very hard to find

874
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,799
commercially uh you would do a

875
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,440
combination of these things where you

876
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,160
would take a compost you would thermally

877
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,880
heat it you would then let some worms

878
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,199
work through it or maybe a static

879
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,800
statically compost the the material

880
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,598
longer after it's gone through this

881
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,200
thermal process and that's going to

882
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,880
create your most biodiverse high quality

883
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:54,519
compost from a from a biological

884
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,079
perspective now what's available

885
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:00,599
commercially for compost is mostly worm

886
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,800
castings and thermal composts uh because

887
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:06,838
of that pathogen requirement that you're

888
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,680
you're usually have to deal with so what

889
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,440
I what I find on the market typically

890
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:14,679
for commercial compost is pretty poor

891
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,000
and so I've searched around our area to

892
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:19,078
see what's available and um in the

893
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,199
Northwest these are the best composts

894
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,680
that I found so uh the first one is this

895
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,679
o mountain fish compost it's a it's a

896
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:31,279
2-year aged fish compost it's a very

897
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:33,598
dark Rich uh color to it um it has a

898
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,160
fair amount of nitrogen it's reasonably

899
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,838
low in heavy metals they do use a little

900
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,480
bit of postc consumer waste so there's

901
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,039
yard waste in there unfortunately um so

902
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,440
I will on occasion come across little

903
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:47,318
bits of plastic or other things in the

904
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,880
compost um but the big thing that they

905
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:52,079
do well I think and frankly the quality

906
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,960
has gone down a little bit in the last

907
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,960
few years I feel like um is they age the

908
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,199
compost for a minimum of two years after

909
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,240
thermal composting it and that's the key

910
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,279
difference I think in quality because a

911
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,679
lot of the commercial composts that you

912
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,800
see on the market um are really only

913
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,679
composted for like 60 to 90 days they're

914
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,119
turned really quickly and so you just

915
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,519
don't end up with something that's

916
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,519
necessarily a finished product and that

917
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,318
can cause issue with um there being high

918
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,960
levels of ammonium the nitrogen still

919
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:26,199
cycling the biological communities in

920
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,519
those composts are just not as evolved

921
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:33,239
or as uh beneficial for plants so if you

922
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,559
can find yourself a high quality compost

923
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,159
and as a side note if you're formulating

924
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,799
a soil mix it should always start with

925
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,920
the compost these recipes I see online

926
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,160
where people just list a bunch of

927
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,039
ingredients those recipes your results

928
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,879
are going to vary um absolutely because

929
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:51,679
everyone's compost source is different

930
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,358
and compost brings in a fair amount of

931
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,239
fertility and so you need to account for

932
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:59,279
that when you're mixing and formulating

933
00:38:55,239 --> 00:39:01,919
a soil mix so that's the oie fish

934
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,680
compost uh one that one that we

935
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,480
discovered in the last couple of years

936
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,838
is this Lane compost they are out of

937
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,119
Oregon um I'm really excited about it I

938
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:15,318
really like the the look of the compost

939
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,200
um and what we've done with them is they

940
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:19,239
have a fish compost as well I really

941
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,838
like fish composts in general but they

942
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:23,919
can be high in heavy metals so what

943
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,719
we've done with the lane compost is

944
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,119
we've taken their um garden compost and

945
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,719
their fish compost post we have it

946
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,160
specially Blended just for us at 50/50

947
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,919
and we've had that tested for heavy

948
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,598
metals and for fertility and then we've

949
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,039
created soil mixes around that blend and

950
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,800
this is something that I like because

951
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,199
it's significantly lower in heavy metals

952
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,359
and we're seeing good overall plant

953
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,318
growth and health from using the lane

954
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:51,400
compost again they do use a small amount

955
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:54,039
of uh postc consumer waste but I think

956
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,680
less than what I see in the oie either

957
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,039
that or they're they're uh filtering it

958
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,919
a lot better but um

959
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,199
I tend to I tend to like this compost

960
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,159
myself a little bit better than the oie

961
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,199
um so this is sort of my go-to for the

962
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,399
most affordable high quality compost

963
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:11,598
I've seen um available here in the

964
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,119
Northwest and we do sell all of these

965
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,640
composts on our website if you can't

966
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,400
find something locally that you want to

967
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:20,400
use in your

968
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,639
garden um the next one that I have is

969
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,960
the highest quality commercial compost

970
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,679
that I've found um it's called SE Coast

971
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,440
compost they're actually doing a

972
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,078
biodynamic process which you can read

973
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,200
about it's um it's it's a variety of

974
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,200
different uh preps that they do

975
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:42,519
specifically for their compost um they

976
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,679
do also use fish products uh to make

977
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:46,199
this compost and there is no postc

978
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:50,239
consumer waste so there you don't have

979
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:52,960
to worry about Plastics or any sort of

980
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,879
trace residues of things that gardeners

981
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,960
might have thrown in their yard bin that

982
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,000
may not have broken down um as rapidly

983
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,358
as you may have liked so that's where

984
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,599
the SE SE Coast compost shines um and

985
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:09,279
for our cannabis Growers that are in

986
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,880
regulated States for heavy metals we now

987
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,160
do a blend with this compost because it

988
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,280
is by far the lowest heavy metal compost

989
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:20,879
that we found um on the market so it's a

990
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,599
it's a wonderful alternative it's just

991
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,480
it's just more expensive it cost us more

992
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,838
to ship it here because they're a small

993
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,639
outfit uh on the coast of or of the

994
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:31,639
Oregon post so the shipping cost is

995
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,440
higher and the cost of the compost for

996
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,838
them to make it and produce it is higher

997
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,400
too so um if you have a little more room

998
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,159
in your budget and you are concerned

999
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,119
about heavy metals or Plastics and

1000
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,879
things like that this is a wonderful

1001
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,760
option um it's what I'm currently using

1002
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,599
in um my garden since we've discovered

1003
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,720
it and started formulating with it over

1004
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,720
the last couple of

1005
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:00,480
years all right so moving on to worm

1006
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,639
castings so we call this our fungal

1007
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,039
compost this is really uh a worm

1008
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,679
castings product though we take a

1009
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,880
combination of a few different worm

1010
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:12,639
castings and composts we add nutrients

1011
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,760
to it things like um organic alfalfa

1012
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:19,000
meal for example as a way of Awakening

1013
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,680
and invigorating the biology

1014
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,838
specifically the fungal communities in

1015
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:25,159
the soil and then we use this for making

1016
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,639
compost tea now we call it a fungal

1017
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:30,399
compost but it contains all sets of

1018
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,799
microorganisms and it's something that

1019
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,880
um that we really like using like I said

1020
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,480
in compost tea but you can also top

1021
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,559
dress your plant with it and things like

1022
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,159
that as a way of increasing your soil

1023
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:46,119
biology so that's what this product is

1024
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:48,960
now we do have a worm castings that is

1025
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:52,640
made from African worm castings and this

1026
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,599
is the most visually appealing compost

1027
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,318
um worm castings I've ever seen the

1028
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,720
African worms take a little bit larger

1029
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:03,960
poop and so you have these little tiny

1030
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:05,719
uh very rich fertile balls that um you

1031
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,800
can see and I'll try and put a photo up

1032
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:13,000
of it U but this is a very clean uh nice

1033
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,839
looking compost um that is made from

1034
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,159
African worms that is is really great it

1035
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,279
has good biological activity uh and

1036
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,480
we've used it for years similar to the

1037
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:27,960
fungal compost in fact this makes up a a

1038
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:31,000
portion of our fungal compost recipe

1039
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,679
okay so again to recap if you're

1040
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,440
thinking about a compost do your

1041
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:38,118
research uh get a chemical analysis from

1042
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,358
the company get a heavy metal analysis

1043
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,920
find out exactly what's in it ask them

1044
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:44,719
what they're using to make the compost

1045
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,639
and make sure that what you're starting

1046
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,039
with is high quality the compost

1047
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,960
fraction I can't emphasize enough just

1048
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:54,480
how important it is okay moving on

1049
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,318
though to what I have in front of me

1050
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,480
here this is kind of what's left of

1051
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:01,318
amendments I have on this side some um

1052
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,559
some

1053
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,440
Blended craft fertilizers and then over

1054
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,359
here I have some trace minerals and just

1055
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,960
a few things that I haven't I didn't get

1056
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:12,279
to talk about in the last video because

1057
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:16,838
I ran out of space

1058
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,960
so let's start with the trace minerals

1059
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:22,239
so first one over here this crazy

1060
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,800
looking uh blue crystals this is copper

1061
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:28,719
sulfate so copper sulfate is a a great

1062
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,559
opt option if you need to raise copper

1063
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:34,118
levels in your soil if you do you're

1064
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,880
using the tiniest amount of the stuff

1065
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,519
we're talking fractions of teaspoons in

1066
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,240
most cases for hom Growers because it's

1067
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,519
highly concentrated and you you don't

1068
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,358
want to overdo it now there is good

1069
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,599
research to show high levels of copper

1070
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:51,558
will help with some uh disease pressures

1071
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,760
apparently um on the pathogen side but

1072
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,079
again with all of these trace minerals I

1073
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,640
would say be very very careful in fact

1074
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,359
with our soil test testing analysis that

1075
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:04,118
we offer through kiss we don't

1076
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,119
automatically give Trace mineral

1077
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,720
recommendations and the reason for this

1078
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:11,720
is because we typically don't see

1079
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:14,279
deficiencies in living soils related to

1080
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:17,679
trace minerals it's usually something

1081
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,079
more like their watering or your uh

1082
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:24,719
macronutrients you know nitrogen

1083
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,400
potassium calcium phosphorus um those

1084
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,879
sorts of things that you're going to see

1085
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,880
the you're going to see issues with so

1086
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,920
rarely is it trace minerals and once all

1087
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,519
of those things are dialed or if we get

1088
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,318
a leaf tissue analysis that definitely

1089
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:39,358
shows us that we have uh a trace mineral

1090
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,318
deficiency then we'll begin to address

1091
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,920
it

1092
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,838
now some people don't want to use this

1093
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,519
because you know it's blue crystals it's

1094
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,318
obviously been refined and processed it

1095
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,880
is approved for use by the national

1096
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:55,960
organic uh the NOP the national organic

1097
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,838
program uh for organic production if you

1098
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,960
can show you have a defic based off a

1099
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,639
soil test now for those people that

1100
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,119
don't want to use something like that

1101
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,118
hold on let me show you what else there

1102
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,318
is so there are products like this

1103
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:17,838
product here so

1104
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:20,358
this this is a liquid fertilizer this is

1105
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,719
biomin boron and so what they're doing

1106
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:25,119
is they're taking that copper sulfate

1107
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:28,318
they're Keating it so bonding it with

1108
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:31,800
like an amino acid or or or some other

1109
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:34,838
organic molecule and then uh essentially

1110
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,039
selling it to you as a lower

1111
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:40,480
concentration in this case liquid form

1112
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:42,440
of copper so you would use this at a

1113
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,559
slightly higher rates so it's easier to

1114
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,838
dose and there's a number of companies

1115
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,160
that offer products like this I just

1116
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:51,960
happen to have the biomin one with me

1117
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,358
but uh you can't find that so that is

1118
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,679
another alternative again also approved

1119
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:59,799
for use in organic production

1120
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,239
okay moving on to

1121
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,119
manganese now we have started adding

1122
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,759
manganese to our recommendations in very

1123
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,800
low doses um it's one of the one it's

1124
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,040
one of the safer trace minerals to add

1125
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,680
uh so if you if you were going to go

1126
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,719
down the rout of trace minerals I would

1127
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:19,879
start with manganese now these are two

1128
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:21,598
different options for manganese you can

1129
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:27,039
see one's a very fine powder and one is

1130
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:28,440
a a little tiny ball essentially now for

1131
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,960
these sorts of amendments if you're

1132
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,960
adding them to soil I like to mix them

1133
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,240
with water and then water them in to get

1134
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,000
a more even application because again

1135
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:41,639
we're talking parts per million on these

1136
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,400
things so we use the powder primarily

1137
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:49,440
and I think for my last um my last soil

1138
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,920
run I added two teaspoons per yard of

1139
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,280
soil so again like like I said very

1140
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,200
small small

1141
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:01,160
amounts all right so moving on here this

1142
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:04,799
is zinc sulfate same sort of thing as

1143
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:06,598
the others it's just a white powder um

1144
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,160
you would use it in very very small

1145
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:16,519
amounts uh next we have iron sulfate or

1146
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:19,679
Ferris sulfate now iron is tough because

1147
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:22,000
iron is just not available in the pH

1148
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,838
ranges that we like to that our plants

1149
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,719
are going to be happy in Iron becomes

1150
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,480
most available I think in a in a pH

1151
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:30,279
around of four to 4 and a half which uh

1152
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,559
frankly is Not Practical for growing

1153
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:37,680
plants um once you get to higher levels

1154
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:40,319
it it it oxidizes almost immediately

1155
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,879
so uh there are some ways around this

1156
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:45,759
you could Bryant so doctor Consulting

1157
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,200
he's he's talked about creating little

1158
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,079
pockets in the soil near the plant roots

1159
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:52,719
where you put a bunch of iron sulfate in

1160
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:56,119
there together um as a way of maybe

1161
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,399
allowing plants to access iron when we

1162
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:59,440
see

1163
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:03,559
low iron that's where that's where you

1164
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:08,599
see um a lighter yellow color around the

1165
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:10,920
growing um center of the plant um plants

1166
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:13,720
will typically outgrow it so I I rarely

1167
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,119
do a lot in regards to addressing iron

1168
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:18,159
just because it is so it is so tricky in

1169
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:21,119
that regard and and we seem to see we

1170
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,118
seem to hit sufficiency already in most

1171
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,680
cases but one of the ways that you can

1172
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,880
you can look to do that is through iron

1173
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,399
sulfate

1174
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,440
okay so I think that's the main trace

1175
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,798
minerals other than Boron I don't have

1176
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,639
boron in front of me but it's going to

1177
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:39,440
look very similar to the zinc sulfate

1178
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:42,440
it's a white powder um Boron is one you

1179
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,480
want to be especially careful with uh it

1180
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,599
is needed for plant processes but in

1181
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:51,440
very very low rates and so we we rarely

1182
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,960
add um we rarely add Boron and if you do

1183
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,280
be aware that there's a big difference

1184
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,960
between Borox or sorry borax which you

1185
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,839
can find in the grocery store people use

1186
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,358
it for laundry and cleaning um solubor

1187
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,000
which I believe is like six to eight

1188
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:06,279
times stronger levels of boron so you

1189
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,199
want to make sure you're adjusting your

1190
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,240
application rates accordingly or

1191
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:13,598
something like this um which I think is

1192
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:15,679
only like 6 to 8% Boron

1193
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,680
so again just make sure you don't over

1194
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,159
apply Boron because some of these Trace

1195
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:23,199
Min minerals can actually cause soils to

1196
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:27,279
be um infertile or inhospitable to

1197
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,838
plants uh by overdoing it okay moving on

1198
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,400
to

1199
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:33,920
Mineral applications in the form of like

1200
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,358
rock dusts and these these other

1201
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,720
products

1202
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:42,519
so first off we have Jersey greens sand

1203
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:45,480
um I believe it's higher in pottassium

1204
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:48,199
now as a general rule with these Rock

1205
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,880
dusts I first started using these at

1206
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:54,399
fairly High rates because of the work of

1207
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,880
Steve Solomon and Clackamus cot saying

1208
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,838
that trace minerals are really important

1209
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,960
to plants and we want to make sure to

1210
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:03,239
have good uh good levels in there by

1211
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,559
getting a lot of natural rock dust and

1212
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:07,639
things like that into our soil so

1213
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:10,920
originally I was using these products

1214
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:14,118
more I've since backed off quite a bit

1215
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,760
for a few reasons um one they're really

1216
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:19,480
heavy like shockingly heavy I mean it's

1217
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,040
rock dust so uh they're going to raise

1218
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,838
the weights of your soil which for us is

1219
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:26,000
Big because we're shipping soil in some

1220
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:28,400
cases to people um so if we can lower

1221
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,838
our weights that's good uh the biggest

1222
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,920
reason though is because of heavy metals

1223
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:37,279
all of these Rock Dust anything that's

1224
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,559
derived from you know uh that's mined is

1225
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,119
going to have levels of heavy metals and

1226
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:44,319
rock dusts are going to have it in

1227
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,920
higher levels than some of these other

1228
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:49,239
products like gypsum and things like

1229
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,440
that so where the where the rock dust is

1230
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,558
aligned from will have a dramatic impact

1231
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,280
on the chemical composition of the rock

1232
00:51:53,559 --> 00:52:00,400
dust so of the rock dust that we sell

1233
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,880
and use the one that I like the best is

1234
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,559
this

1235
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,798
balt and it it has the lowest levels of

1236
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,599
heavy metals um it's paramagnetic some

1237
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:12,639
people uh believe that that has plant

1238
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:16,240
growth Properties or plant Health

1239
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:18,118
properties um if I were to use a rock

1240
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,879
dust that's the one that I would use and

1241
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:22,079
again I I was using them at much higher

1242
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:26,838
rates I don't use them at nearly the

1243
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:28,000
rates I used to um anymore and the other

1244
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:31,798
thing with this and something I've

1245
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,679
learned from working with a lot of soil

1246
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:36,798
scientists and experts expert

1247
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:39,719
agronomists uh from the podcast is that

1248
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:42,280
these these Rock Dust are not typically

1249
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:45,279
very plant available in the period of

1250
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:48,440
time that we want results in so we're

1251
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,920
talking months to years uh potentially

1252
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,559
decades for some of these things to

1253
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,280
break down whereas we have access to

1254
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,960
other ways to get these minerals much

1255
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,319
much faster uh with releasing rates that

1256
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,639
we can understand and control a lot

1257
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:05,039
better so of the of the minerals and

1258
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,798
rock dust and things that you see here

1259
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:10,239
uh I have glacial Rock Dust which again

1260
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:12,318
fine powder especially important I think

1261
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:16,000
with these Rock Dust is the particle

1262
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:18,519
size and surface area uh in terms of how

1263
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
quickly microbes can break them down so

1264
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:23,639
if you can get a much finer powder or

1265
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,159
micronized version it's going to be more

1266
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:29,078
much more available than larger chunks

1267
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,798
or larger particulate size uh we also

1268
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:34,480
have azomite that's a aluminous silicate

1269
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:36,920
that's also a mind

1270
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,719
product not something that I use I know

1271
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,519
some Growers really like it it's just I

1272
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:44,919
think there's better ways to get trace

1273
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:47,480
minerals than than azomite uh and it

1274
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:51,119
will bring in other things that you may

1275
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,400
not want like aluminum and other um

1276
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,200
other heavy

1277
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,920
metals let's see here oh here this was

1278
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,358
the example of the the

1279
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,119
um the African worm castings that I

1280
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:05,480
actually put into a thing here so let's

1281
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,798
see moving

1282
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:12,400
on okay humates these this is from a

1283
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:17,480
company called Live Earth this is a um

1284
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:20,318
mind product as well humates are the

1285
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:23,480
humic acids and humates are in theory

1286
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:27,639
what happens when a plant material is is

1287
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:30,358
broken down um through that composting

1288
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:36,480
decomposition process and what is left

1289
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:38,000
at the end is uh higher in uh chelation

1290
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,838
property so it's it's better able to

1291
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,960
bond with other minerals and nutrients

1292
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:47,480
um and has some a variety of plant

1293
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:51,079
properties now most humic acid products

1294
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:54,039
are um their mind typically and are

1295
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:56,920
typically extracted from leonardite uh

1296
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:58,558
but which is a particular Rock mineral

1297
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,000
there are other ones that are derived

1298
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,680
from Plants um but yeah that's

1299
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,920
essentially what you're looking at there

1300
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:07,519
there is a lot more research in the last

1301
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,599
decade around humic substances and their

1302
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:13,719
plant benefits I would throw the caveat

1303
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:16,240
out there that um you do have levels of

1304
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:19,078
humic substances if you're using compost

1305
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:22,798
already you may see benefit to adding

1306
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:24,599
more uh but the research that I've seen

1307
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,719
is a bit varied so it's not something

1308
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,160
that I use a ton of but I can I I do

1309
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,719
appreciate that there is research to

1310
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,639
support the use of humid substances in

1311
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,358
your garden and I am hoping to get an

1312
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:37,759
expert on to talk more in depth about it

1313
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:37,759
here in the

1314
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:46,759
future okay next I have molted barley so

1315
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:48,719
the idea behind malted barley grain is

1316
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,359
that and this is this is all from

1317
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:54,480
Clackamus cud this is where this all

1318
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:56,318
started it's that the nutrients all the

1319
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,079
nutrients that the plant needs is

1320
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:02,119
contained in the seed and if we take

1321
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:04,359
that seed and we Sprout that seed and

1322
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:06,000
then arrest that sprouting process

1323
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:09,199
that's what essentially malting is that

1324
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,119
we use for beer making and other uh

1325
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,679
other beverages essentially what that

1326
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,838
does is that that stops that enzymatic

1327
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:19,879
process at its highest level so when we

1328
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:23,480
originally started what cute had

1329
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:26,720
everyone doing was sprouting seeds and

1330
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,920
then grinding them up and then apply in

1331
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,798
that as a way to raise the en enzymatic

1332
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,639
levels in your soil and pick up a

1333
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:37,000
variety of different um

1334
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:39,118
enzymes now we've since moved on to Malt

1335
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,719
to the malting this is just much simpler

1336
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,680
and easier and it's done professionally

1337
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:46,199
for you consistently because if you let

1338
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,719
the seed go too long or you don't apply

1339
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:49,159
it right away you can't end up with

1340
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:52,598
alcohols or other things that could

1341
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:54,598
damage your plant now I did some

1342
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:56,359
research I did some trials sorry I

1343
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,880
didn't do research I did some trials

1344
00:56:56,358 --> 00:57:00,639
with this in my garden and I didn't get

1345
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,838
the plant response that other people

1346
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:05,838
have claimed they have gotten uh so it's

1347
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,199
not something that I use but again I

1348
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:10,880
just want to share why Growers are doing

1349
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:12,439
it and the I the theory behind why they

1350
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,798
might use it I would love to see some

1351
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,358
actual research come out on this uh in

1352
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,639
the future

1353
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:20,199
but that's that's that's where the

1354
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,639
malted grain comes in and that's why

1355
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:24,038
people use it and so essentially you

1356
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:26,879
would just grind it up in a blender and

1357
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:29,559
then uh top dress it was and over the

1358
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,280
top and you should see better overall

1359
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:32,798
plant growth and plant health and some

1360
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,720
people claim their plants just explode

1361
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:37,440
in growth again I did not get that

1362
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,679
response myself um but that doesn't mean

1363
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,240
it's going to be the same for

1364
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:44,879
everybody okay uh corn gluten meal I

1365
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:48,479
just threw this one in here it really

1366
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,119
doesn't belong I just um forgot to do it

1367
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,240
in the last video and I had some it's

1368
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:56,680
not something we sell a lot of uh you

1369
00:57:53,239 --> 00:58:01,000
will see it sold in big box stores as a

1370
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:03,318
weed uh pre-emergent so when cor corn

1371
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,280
gluten meal it's hard to say is applied

1372
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:08,199
to Lawns at the right time in the spring

1373
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,798
it can help prevent weed seeds from

1374
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:13,000
germinating so it does have um some of

1375
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:16,199
those properties but it is also a source

1376
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,400
of nitrogen so I just want to mention it

1377
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:19,879
but it's not one that I recommend or use

1378
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,200
a

1379
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:26,920
lot okay so now what I have left here

1380
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,798
are all various blends of um uh organic

1381
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,318
amendments and sometimes that's easier

1382
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,199
for folks you know if you don't want to

1383
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,159
go through the the trials and

1384
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:35,798
tribulations of mixing your own and you

1385
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,279
want something that you know is going to

1386
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:40,719
be consistent or give you an expected

1387
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,640
response this is this is a good option

1388
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:46,000
for folks so the first one I have here

1389
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:49,318
this is what we call our micro Catalyst

1390
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,639
this does have some nutrient level or

1391
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:54,279
fertilizer level in it but what we use

1392
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:56,558
this for is after testing a variety of

1393
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,720
different recipes and products products

1394
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:02,359
we ended up using this microb Catalyst

1395
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:05,118
as a um essentially a micro catalyst so

1396
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:07,358
when we make compost teas for example in

1397
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,240
a five gallon Brewer we would use a half

1398
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:12,000
a cup of this with a tablespoon of

1399
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:16,759
organic Alfalfa as our food source and

1400
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:19,079
we get a much better overall um growth

1401
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,119
of mic microbes across all sets of

1402
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:24,440
microorganisms and better U diversity in

1403
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:27,079
biomass than if we were just using

1404
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,519
molasses that being said head if you

1405
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:31,200
live somewhere where you have easy

1406
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:32,559
access to organic black strap molasses

1407
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,118
that is another alternative that you can

1408
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,920
use for making compost tea molasses is

1409
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,798
also sticky it's hard to deal with this

1410
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,318
is just much easier and so that's one of

1411
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,239
the other reasons that we really like it

1412
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,798
so that's some that's the microb

1413
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:47,000
catalysts that we

1414
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:50,358
produce uh next one I have here this

1415
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,199
lighter colored one is our Bloom booster

1416
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:55,558
that's this product right here the kiss

1417
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:58,838
Bloom booster is something that Andrew

1418
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:01,760
on our team team worked really dedicated

1419
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:04,679
uh two years almost in formulating to

1420
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,200
get just the right ratios of organic

1421
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:09,679
mment to give us the highest levels of

1422
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:12,798
available p and K just a little bit of

1423
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:16,078
nitrogen and then um the clean absolute

1424
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:19,000
cleanest heavy metals report in regards

1425
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,160
to uh organic Bloom boosters that I've

1426
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,280
seen on the market it's so clean on

1427
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:25,078
heavy metals so if you are worried about

1428
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,359
heavy metals which frankly it's

1429
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,798
something I think everyone should be

1430
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:29,838
thinking about or if you're in a

1431
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:33,639
regulated state where you're tested for

1432
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:35,639
heavy metals this is a wonderful

1433
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:38,480
option all

1434
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:40,960
right so this product here this is

1435
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,000
Solomon's mix and what this is this is

1436
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:47,079
Steve Solomon's recipe for making a

1437
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,318
complete organic fertilizer

1438
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:52,318
now one thing I want to mention with

1439
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:53,798
this is this is designed for growing

1440
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,239
mineral

1441
01:00:53,798 --> 01:01:00,000
nutrient-rich mineral dense vegetables

1442
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:03,519
it's not made for maximizing your

1443
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,519
cannabis Harvest or yield and Steve

1444
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:08,759
acknowledges that

1445
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:11,559
so it doesn't have the same ratios or

1446
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,760
levels of fertility as some of the other

1447
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:15,319
uh ones I'm going to talk about here but

1448
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,440
what it will do is it will give you much

1449
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:21,199
higher levels of trace and minerals uh

1450
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,480
Steve is a big proponent of using these

1451
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:26,679
trace minerals in low levels as a way of

1452
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:29,880
raising the overall nutrition of the

1453
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:33,000
food and while there isn't a ton of

1454
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,838
research on this topic um there there

1455
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,880
are a lot of Growers that are using this

1456
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:38,558
for their vegetable gardens if they

1457
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,440
don't aren't doing soil testing this is

1458
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,720
sort of his best guess recipe for what

1459
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:48,079
he thinks your garden might need so

1460
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:52,239
that's the Steve Solomon

1461
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,400
CF now this this is our mineral mix um

1462
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:56,318
this is if you want to get a combination

1463
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,519
of you know these limes and some rock

1464
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,759
dust and those sorts of things uh

1465
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:03,960
without buying all the

1466
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:06,039
individual products so so if you want to

1467
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,519
get some calcium as well as some trace

1468
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:10,240
minerals in the form of rock dust again

1469
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:13,599
Rock Dust are not my favorite but we do

1470
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,919
make this product um and it is available

1471
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,920
for for people who are looking for

1472
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,480
something like that so for example if

1473
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,318
you had a garden and you already had the

1474
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,920
macro nutrients and you just wanted to

1475
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:25,960
add some more uh trace minerals and you

1476
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,599
weren't in a rush for them to be a

1477
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,159
immediately available to your to your

1478
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,119
vegetable garden for example this is

1479
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:35,358
this is an option in that

1480
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:37,640
regard and then this last one here this

1481
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:40,798
is our nutrient pack this is where we

1482
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:42,558
started as a company I formulated this

1483
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:47,278
and we've made little tweaks to it but I

1484
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:49,119
formulated this 15 shoot maybe even I

1485
01:02:47,278 --> 01:02:53,440
think yeah probably about 15 20 years

1486
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:56,480
ago now and what this is is this is the

1487
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,639
nutrient portion of our

1488
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:03,240
soil mix for our water only and our

1489
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:06,038
biocharge soils so if you can't you know

1490
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:07,199
or if if shipping soil to you is not

1491
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:08,799
practical because you're on the other

1492
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,519
side of the country for example and you

1493
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,038
can mix your own soils but you don't

1494
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:15,679
want to guess at the minerals and

1495
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,278
nutrients that your plant might need um

1496
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,118
this is a great way to do that so we

1497
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:20,599
have a whole example on the page of a

1498
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,400
walkth through how you would use this

1499
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:24,200
product it can be top dressed similar to

1500
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,559
the our balloon booster and both of

1501
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:27,679
these products are registered for use in

1502
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,599
organic

1503
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,038
production for folks and this is

1504
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,838
something that we took a long time to

1505
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,400
come up with so if you're re amending

1506
01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:38,558
your soil or you're mixing new soils uh

1507
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,519
this nutrient pack is a great option and

1508
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,960
that's this product right here oh it's

1509
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:48,000
heavy there we

1510
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:50,000
go okay so all that being said I have a

1511
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,559
few other products kind of floating

1512
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,159
around here that I wanted to touch on uh

1513
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,680
before we go so

1514
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,719
first off I have this uh this is from

1515
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:03,480
dinoo this is micro risal fungi now I've

1516
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:06,078
done a lot of videos and I have a blog

1517
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,278
post on micro isal fungi but I want to

1518
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,798
talk a little bit about it in here

1519
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:10,798
because it's it's sort of part of what

1520
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:15,599
people do when they're growing plants

1521
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:20,400
so microanal fungi is a particular

1522
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:22,359
species or spe or um classification of

1523
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,880
fungus that forms a symbiotic

1524
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:27,318
relationship with the roots of our

1525
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:30,640
plants um there are a variety of

1526
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:32,880
different species of micro risal fungi

1527
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:35,000
and they can be very plant specific so

1528
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,039
for example in this product we have

1529
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,960
glomus

1530
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:45,760
inates and glomus masier and those two

1531
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:49,440
are have a relationship with um fruit

1532
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,839
trees cannabis most vegetables not

1533
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:55,440
brassicas though

1534
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:58,119
um and the way you would use this would

1535
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,760
be a one-time application directly to

1536
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:03,160
your roots of your plant when the plant

1537
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,839
is Young so for things like lettu uses I

1538
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:07,480
probably wouldn't bother with it for

1539
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:09,920
things like tomatoes peppers maybe your

1540
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:13,480
cannabis plant um what we'll what you'll

1541
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:16,680
see by adding a product like this is

1542
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:20,559
higher uh uptake of phosphorus and other

1543
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:22,759
nutrients um better drought resistance

1544
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:27,640
and and ability to cope with different

1545
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,640
environmental uh abiotic stresses so

1546
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,599
micro isal fungi is great the one thing

1547
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,440
about it is for people who are concerned

1548
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:37,680
about heavy metals uh in regulated

1549
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,639
States I've kind of shied away from this

1550
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:42,679
because there is research that shows

1551
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:45,598
that uh micro isal funge will increase

1552
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:47,480
the uptake of heavy metals which makes

1553
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,359
sense because it increases the uptake of

1554
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,880
and flow of nutrients into the plant it

1555
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:54,558
is a very um mutualistic uh relationship

1556
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,880
that it has with your plant and your

1557
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,680
plant roots so

1558
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,318
uh those that's the one case use case

1559
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:03,239
where I wouldn't use it

1560
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,199
now when shopping around for a micro

1561
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:08,038
risal product there's a few things to

1562
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:11,558
keep in mind so you may you may look on

1563
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:14,599
the back and see propagules or cfus or

1564
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:18,160
um Spore count and that's where things

1565
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:18,160
get really confusing

1566
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:23,079
because there there are different types

1567
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:26,119
of micro isal fungi like I mentioned um

1568
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:29,200
some are Endo micro isal fungi which in

1569
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:32,278
the case of most most of our plants uh

1570
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:34,000
like this um like fruit trees vegetables

1571
01:06:32,278 --> 01:06:35,679
things like that that's what we're

1572
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,639
looking for and these glomus species

1573
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:41,919
fall into that category there are other

1574
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:44,078
micro isal species that are Ecto microa

1575
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,798
and those actually form a sheath around

1576
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,039
the outside of the roots whereas these

1577
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:51,960
infect inside the plant you cannot see

1578
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:54,278
endom micro risal fungi on a plant root

1579
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,679
without staining the roots and looking

1580
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:58,760
with a microscope I hear people say oh

1581
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,679
that's you know they see you know little

1582
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,359
white fuzziness around a healthy root

1583
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:04,719
and they say oh that has micro isal

1584
01:07:02,358 --> 01:07:06,639
fungi that's not micro isal fungi that's

1585
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:08,759
just healthy root hairs in the case of

1586
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:12,558
vegetables fruit trees things like that

1587
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:15,039
now if you have a conifer then Ecto

1588
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,559
microa is the type of Micro isal fungi

1589
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,359
that you want and so when you look on

1590
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,760
some of these labels you may see you

1591
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:23,078
know in this case we have 700 propagules

1592
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,760
per gram of glomus inates that's a

1593
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:28,079
pretty high level assuming that this

1594
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,520
package contains what it says it does

1595
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,839
and that's a whole another thing within

1596
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:32,400
the gardening industry is you can't

1597
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,599
necessarily trust these labels to be

1598
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,160
accurate now I trust this company but

1599
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:37,480
that doesn't mean I you know there's

1600
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:38,798
research through the Oregon Department

1601
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,000
of egg that shows that many of these

1602
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:43,159
companies and what they list on the

1603
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,159
labels are not always 100% what's

1604
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:49,798
actually in the product but you may see

1605
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:53,278
one that shows two million uh spores or

1606
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:56,679
cfus per per gram of uh micro risal

1607
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:58,000
fungi but if it's Ecto mro isal fungi

1608
01:07:56,679 --> 01:07:59,639
it's not going to form a relationship

1609
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,159
with your cannabis plant and so you

1610
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:04,239
can't really count those towards you

1611
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:06,440
getting a good infection level so it's

1612
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:07,879
important to buy the right type for the

1613
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,358
plant that you're growing I can't

1614
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:14,160
emphasize that

1615
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:16,519
enough now uh in addition to that this

1616
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:19,599
product is you know glomus intereses

1617
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:23,640
glomus masier uh you may find another

1618
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:26,960
product like um pumpkin Pro for example

1619
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:30,119
that may have uh glomus atates also

1620
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:33,158
called Riso fagus irregularis uh just to

1621
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:35,798
further complicate things um if it's

1622
01:08:33,158 --> 01:08:37,358
made somewhere else by a different

1623
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:40,278
company that's producing it it's going

1624
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,838
to be a slightly different strain and

1625
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:44,120
when that happens you may get slightly

1626
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:46,798
different results so I did a whole

1627
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:48,759
podcast with the the creator of this

1628
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:52,000
product and one of the things that he

1629
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:54,479
talks about is the the the strain that

1630
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
they're using of glomus andin was

1631
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,238
developed out of

1632
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,158
uh Israel and it's a very uh it came

1633
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:04,519
from a very harsh environment so it's

1634
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:07,158
very good at dealing with a variety of

1635
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,440
environmental conditions including um a

1636
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:12,599
lack of water like drought stress and

1637
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:15,158
things like that so when you see any of

1638
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,440
these microbial products what we're

1639
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:18,559
talking about here is they're one

1640
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,399
they're not going to be all the same

1641
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,120
even if they have the same name like

1642
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,599
tricoderma you know you're not

1643
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:27,599
necessarily getting the same strain

1644
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,960
species of tricoderma from if you're

1645
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,560
buying it from different companies so

1646
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,359
you may have to try different ones to

1647
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,839
get different results um but you just

1648
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,319
have to keep in mind too that these

1649
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,759
these these will give you

1650
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,080
um these will give you good results if

1651
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,399
you use them correctly but it's

1652
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:45,679
important to do your research okay

1653
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,759
enough on

1654
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:53,399
that what else do we have here

1655
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:55,640
oh so this is our uh compost te kit not

1656
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:57,198
gonna spend a lot of time on compost te

1657
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,960
this is where our company started before

1658
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:02,319
I ever got into these amendments um I

1659
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,039
have a wonderful blog on compost te if

1660
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,479
you want to read more about it um and

1661
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:08,679
I'm happy to answer any questions

1662
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:10,759
compost tea is not a silver bullet as

1663
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:14,039
some people may tell you but what it

1664
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:16,960
does do is it increases the biological

1665
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:18,039
um activity in your soil potentially

1666
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,000
because you're adding a lot more

1667
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:21,519
microbes and it can increase nutrient

1668
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,079
cycling I think that's the key thing to

1669
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,440
think about is is increasing nutrient

1670
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:28,960
cycling in your soil and so our kit this

1671
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:32,198
is what we'd use in our 5 gallon

1672
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:35,119
microbat it's a compost which contains

1673
01:10:32,198 --> 01:10:37,119
the biology then we have the food source

1674
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,719
to feed that biology it goes into the

1675
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:40,519
Brewer which creates the optimal

1676
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,520
environment for these microbes to

1677
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:46,679
reproduce and then we take that tea and

1678
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:49,560
apply it to our soil or to our plants

1679
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:53,440
um again it's important to understand

1680
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:57,000
that compost tea is not the Cure All for

1681
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,599
everything but certain in certain um

1682
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,158
cases people can get pretty dramatic

1683
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,039
results from it it is going to give you

1684
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:04,399
a little bit of fertility primarily

1685
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:05,640
nitrogen um when you add that so it's

1686
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:08,079
something to account for too when you're

1687
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:12,119
making and using compost

1688
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:15,039
teas okay this is H egil 168 or

1689
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:16,679
potassium silicate this is what many of

1690
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:20,279
the silica products on the market are

1691
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:22,600
derived from this is just a uh powdered

1692
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:25,359
form and the advantage being cost so you

1693
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,199
can take this and make your own silica

1694
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,079
own gallon of silica out of a pound of

1695
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:32,359
this uh for you know Pennies on the

1696
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:35,119
dollar compared to what they charge to

1697
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:38,679
to give it to you in a fancy bottle um

1698
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,639
it's uh 32% potassium negligable amount

1699
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:42,158
though when you think about how much

1700
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:44,600
you're using so I would take something

1701
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:46,238
this size add it to a gallon of water

1702
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,760
and then

1703
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:50,599
um shake it really well and then use it

1704
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,880
at a rate of a teaspoon or two per

1705
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,280
gallon of water of that liquid

1706
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,119
concentrate that I've made so again

1707
01:11:55,279 --> 01:12:00,319
you're not using very much but this is a

1708
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:02,198
great way to get silica consistently

1709
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:04,880
into your plant it's something you could

1710
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:06,279
water with um you know every watering or

1711
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,960
every other watering throughout your

1712
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:10,519
plant's life cycle to get a lot of the

1713
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,520
benefits of

1714
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:18,520
silica let's see so over here I have the

1715
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:20,719
Pacific grow Oceanic fish hydrate they

1716
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,239
also make a product called sea fos The

1717
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,198
reason it's not sitting here is because

1718
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:26,479
I I used it recently with my plants um

1719
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:28,319
it's going to be a little bit higher in

1720
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:33,678
phosphorus because it's stabilized with

1721
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:37,319
phosphoric acid um but fish hydrate caos

1722
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:40,440
these types of products are sort of your

1723
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:42,439
cheap bloom formula or grow formula

1724
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,119
liquid formula it's one of the few

1725
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:46,799
liquid products that I really like to

1726
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:48,599
have on hand because all the stuff I've

1727
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,760
talked about so far it takes a little

1728
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,400
while you know it can take five five to

1729
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,280
10 days for you to really see a plant

1730
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,238
response after fertilizing and if you

1731
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:57,559
have a plant that's low in nutrients we

1732
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:59,079
don't want to wait that long we don't

1733
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,320
want to let it suffer for that long

1734
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:03,679
because that's going to impact its

1735
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:06,359
overall health make it more um more

1736
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:08,600
susceptible to diseases more susceptible

1737
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:10,319
to pests because it's stressed out and

1738
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,639
it's going to impact our overall yield

1739
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:15,198
so in those cases if I see I have a

1740
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:17,800
nitrogen deficiency for example if I'm

1741
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:19,559
seeing a lighter yellow plant yellowing

1742
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,560
leaves at the bottom I'm going to hit it

1743
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,880
with something like this and maybe do a

1744
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:26,000
top dressing of a nitrogen Amendment at

1745
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,560
the same time as a way to get some

1746
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,238
immediate end of the plant and then I'll

1747
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,880
probably do a few feedings of something

1748
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:34,279
like this to kind of spoon feed it or

1749
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,960
the other way I use this or the sea f is

1750
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:39,039
if I'm halfway through the cycle and I

1751
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:41,359
realize I under amended my plants then

1752
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,760
um I can kind of spoon feed them you

1753
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,519
know essentially like I would if it was

1754
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:47,119
a bottle of nutrient to get them through

1755
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,280
the rest of the growth cycle or if you

1756
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:50,880
have really little plants um you know

1757
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:52,880
seedlings things like that this is

1758
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,639
another great way to dose fertility at

1759
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,719
low levels for your plants so the one

1760
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:59,840
the one bad thing about fish hydrate is

1761
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:01,520
it stinks it smells like fish it's a

1762
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,560
really strong smell that's the one

1763
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,440
downside to these products but other

1764
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:09,840
than that I really like to use

1765
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:13,000
them um microbial products

1766
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,920
so we primarily are using microbial mass

1767
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,039
now and actually the founder of Mammoth

1768
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,840
P um Colin Bell who I've had on the

1769
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:22,198
podcast a good friend of mine he's over

1770
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,679
there at microbial Mass too and I

1771
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:25,279
actually knew the founders of microbial

1772
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,000
Mass way back in the day when they first

1773
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,960
we're getting started uh and they're

1774
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,600
great folks Mammoth P was sort of that

1775
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,840
first product on the market they're

1776
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,719
actually no longer around this is what's

1777
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,840
left of my Supply and I just had a had

1778
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:40,520
one here so I thought I'd show it to you

1779
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,880
but by adding specific microbes in this

1780
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:45,880
case uh PS solubilizing microbes um

1781
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,359
we're going to get better nutrient

1782
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,119
uptake and there's there's actually a

1783
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,599
fair bit of research around using these

1784
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:53,439
sorts of microbial bio stimulants um

1785
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,800
that are very targeted versus something

1786
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:57,000
like compost te which is just a shotgun

1787
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,440
approach of microbes we're just putting

1788
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,960
out all the microbes that were in the

1789
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:02,519
compost and seeing which ones uh the

1790
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,639
plant might want whereas here we're

1791
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,000
we're targeting it with very high

1792
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:10,600
concentrated levels of specific microbes

1793
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,560
that we know do specific things um again

1794
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,960
I'm showing you Mammoth P only because

1795
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,480
I'm using this up and then I'll be um

1796
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:20,279
switching over to microbial Mass which

1797
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:22,839
we do have available on our

1798
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:27,119
website um let's see what

1799
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:30,679
else okay one last thing to talk about

1800
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:32,599
is silica so I've already talked about

1801
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:34,239
the benefits of silica but one of the

1802
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,960
things to know about silica is

1803
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:38,079
availability and if you want to do a

1804
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:41,560
deep dive on this I did a podcast with

1805
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:43,920
Dr Wendy zelner she is a silica expert

1806
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,159
and uh explained it much better than I

1807
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,840
will in this video but essentially

1808
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:50,679
there's three different sources of

1809
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:53,520
silica that we can use in our garden and

1810
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:56,319
they have different availability to the

1811
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,199
plant so one the most so the first one

1812
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:01,840
be Amorphis and that's what this um egg

1813
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:05,238
sill is and it's a very uh it's one of

1814
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,159
the most plant available forms of silica

1815
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:08,879
uh because it converts it to cicc acid

1816
01:16:07,158 --> 01:16:13,879
and then the plant can take that

1817
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:15,440
up uh the next one would be um biogenic

1818
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,039
silica and that would be something that

1819
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:19,799
just essentially it's plant derived so

1820
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:23,920
you you hear of silica derived from Rice

1821
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:27,600
holes or from um bamboo that would be a

1822
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:30,679
biogenic source of silica and the issue

1823
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,120
with um with that is just you may be

1824
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:33,880
picking up heavy metals and it's not

1825
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:37,238
going to be as available as Amorphis

1826
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,279
forms and then the last form is quartz

1827
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:42,519
and quartz is literally Rock and that's

1828
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,238
what these sorts of um products are and

1829
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:47,320
I'm not picking on this company they're

1830
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:48,919
very nice they sent me this product um

1831
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:51,519
the one problem I have with these

1832
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:54,079
products is we don't know when or how

1833
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,520
available they actually are from my

1834
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,238
understanding from talking to Dr zelner

1835
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,199
is we're talking period of months to

1836
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:02,198
years before this silica becomes

1837
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,719
available and because there's so many

1838
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:06,879
variables in terms of when it would

1839
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:08,319
become available like um you know how

1840
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,520
much weathering has occurred the

1841
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:13,000
particle size the moisture level the

1842
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,120
microbes in the soil uh where we really

1843
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,119
just don't know when we're going to be

1844
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:19,319
getting that silica or those trace

1845
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:21,639
minerals so keep that in mind with

1846
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:25,960
products like

1847
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:28,840
this uh let's see okay so so I have a

1848
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,920
few IPM products that I just keep in my

1849
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,520
garden pantry and so I just wanted to

1850
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,359
add those to the end of this video just

1851
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,280
because I like to use them um oh but

1852
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:40,639
before I do I forgot about dious Earth I

1853
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:43,279
meant to put one put some in here it's a

1854
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:44,840
white flower looking product there is

1855
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:47,399
actually good research that shows that

1856
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:54,119
dious Earth will provide available

1857
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:54,119
silica uh I believe it was Dr um

1858
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:01,600
Nicole go apologies for that Dr Nicole

1859
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:04,439
goce did research and showed a 70%

1860
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:08,679
reduction in powdery mildew by using

1861
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:11,719
dious Earth and wellas night I think as

1862
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:14,600
SI sources um but again I'm doing this

1863
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:16,399
off off of memory so I I will I will

1864
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,360
have to check and double check that one

1865
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:19,519
but that is another option for getting

1866
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:23,198
available

1867
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:26,199
silica okay so moving on to

1868
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:28,119
IPM what I have here yellow sticky card

1869
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:29,799
most of you guys are familiar with these

1870
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:31,960
what I want to share and this particular

1871
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,840
one is from catchmaster I really like

1872
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,760
this brand um and I've talked to the

1873
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,159
owners of the company the nice thing

1874
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,639
about this is it's

1875
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:43,399
um sticky cards have g a lot better you

1876
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:45,159
know um this adhesive while sticky it

1877
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:47,119
doesn't stay stuck to my hands I don't

1878
01:18:45,158 --> 01:18:49,198
end up with this glue that I'm like

1879
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:51,519
picking out on my fingers for the next

1880
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:53,719
you know the next day or so if this gets

1881
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,120
in my hair I can I can get it out pretty

1882
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:57,960
easily with a little bit of soapy water

1883
01:18:56,119 --> 01:19:02,599
um whereas some of the brands out there

1884
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:04,279
that use a a lower quality adhesive will

1885
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,079
will have issues in that regard but it

1886
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:07,639
is enough to catch insects so that's the

1887
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:09,158
key there how much and what type of

1888
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:11,600
adhesive do you want to use to catch

1889
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:13,039
insects without without being really

1890
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,360
hard to work with and things like that

1891
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:18,800
so these cards as you can see they have

1892
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:21,759
um see if I can show you

1893
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,440
here they have perforations on them this

1894
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,280
is the back side U of the card the front

1895
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:28,079
side has has the the black better let me

1896
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:30,158
see if I can pull it off here so you can

1897
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,000
see that there this is for scouting so

1898
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:34,359
you can keep you can keep track of what

1899
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,198
sort of insect pressure you have you can

1900
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:38,079
use these cards for Mass trapping but

1901
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:40,919
the main benefit of these cards is not

1902
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:42,800
mass trapping it's to keep track of

1903
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,679
what's in your garden right now is it a

1904
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,600
fungus net is it a rud Aid is it a

1905
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,079
beneficial is it is it just not a pest

1906
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,159
at all just something flying around that

1907
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:52,519
happen to get into my room it's

1908
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:55,158
important to track these and change

1909
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,280
these out regularly so

1910
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:57,439
I can't tell you how many grows I've

1911
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:59,198
gone into where these things are just

1912
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,079
covered with fungus knats or they've

1913
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:02,319
been up for months that doesn't give us

1914
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:04,319
any good information you need to be

1915
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:07,158
changing these out

1916
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:09,960
consistently so that's what these sensor

1917
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:11,519
cards are now if you do need to do Mass

1918
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,880
trapping I'm only sharing this because

1919
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:17,400
some people weren't aware that this was

1920
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:20,319
a thing you can buy the same material in

1921
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:22,719
these giant rolls so you can string this

1922
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:24,719
across your whole garden and this this

1923
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:27,719
is for Mass trapping so if you just are

1924
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:29,560
trying to catch a lot of fungus snats or

1925
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,920
root aphids or whatever flying winged

1926
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,080
pest that you have that's hitting your

1927
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,520
garden this is the kind of this is what

1928
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:37,198
you want to use something like this so

1929
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,400
only I'm only telling you so people know

1930
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:39,399
it's

1931
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,880
available this would not be my only form

1932
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:46,399
of dealing with a insect in infestation

1933
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,960
though either this would use be used in

1934
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:51,479
conjunction with something else now

1935
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,600
Laden flour you can't spray maybe

1936
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:54,959
something like this comes more into play

1937
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,800
otherwise Mass traff ping and

1938
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,439
conjunction with various sprays uh is a

1939
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,840
great way to help control these things

1940
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,519
or drenches you know we might use

1941
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:05,159
Bavaria we might use um isera there's a

1942
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,719
there's a number of

1943
01:21:05,158 --> 01:21:09,839
microbial uh products that we can apply

1944
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:13,279
specifically for dealing with certain

1945
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,279
insect issues but when it comes to

1946
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:18,079
sprays I want to show you the two

1947
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,679
products that I keep in my garden and

1948
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:22,079
that I'm the most excited about so the

1949
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:25,399
first one is this montere horticultural

1950
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:27,439
oil this is also known as s X this is

1951
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:30,879
just the homeowner size I don't need a

1952
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:33,079
giant size for my small garden this is

1953
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,600
this is more than enough um and this is

1954
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:38,119
mineral oil based now some people don't

1955
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,360
want a mineral oil based product and I

1956
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:41,880
totally get that um keep in mind though

1957
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:43,839
with this this product there's a lot of

1958
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:47,359
good research in terms of what sort of

1959
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:49,239
residual it leaves behind um as well as

1960
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:50,559
when you know what it's going to do so

1961
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:53,638
this is primarily suffocant it's going

1962
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:55,400
to suffocate all the insects um that

1963
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:58,199
that it comes into cont tack so this is

1964
01:21:55,399 --> 01:21:59,960
a really good knockdown spray and you

1965
01:21:58,198 --> 01:22:02,479
can also use it for dipping and a

1966
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:05,039
variety of other things without risking

1967
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:07,919
phytotoxicity but for folks who don't

1968
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:09,560
want to deal with a horticultural oil um

1969
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,800
or something that might be derived from

1970
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,520
mineral

1971
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:16,719
oil this is a new product and this is

1972
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:20,560
just a sample size here uh that being

1973
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:23,520
said this sample size is 3.6 flu ounces

1974
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,760
um this is enough for 30 or 40 gallons

1975
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,480
of spray solution now right now uh sorry

1976
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,880
product's called EPA Shield I probably

1977
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:35,119
should have led with that um it's from

1978
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:38,159
bioworks it is a really um it's a really

1979
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:40,840
cool Plant Botanical product that

1980
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:43,679
they've that they've uh they've created

1981
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:46,239
and formulated and it uses much lower

1982
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:49,239
concentrations than any other Botanical

1983
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:52,079
product on the market um so you have you

1984
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:53,759
have virtually no risk of phytotoxicity

1985
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,119
and it's there's a ton of research

1986
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,960
behind it so I I I normally don't get

1987
01:22:56,119 --> 01:23:01,039
behind 25b products these are products

1988
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,880
that are using ingredients that are

1989
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:06,560
shown to be exempt

1990
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,960
from the uh EPA registration list uh and

1991
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,400
the reason why I don't like these is

1992
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:12,039
because anyone could mix something

1993
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:14,399
together and call it a insecticide and

1994
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:16,319
and and if they're using 25b products

1995
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,599
they can register it and and sell it

1996
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:21,359
whereas there's a ton of research around

1997
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,639
EPA shield and data to support the

1998
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:25,279
efficacy of this product and I'm hoping

1999
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:27,719
to have some something this size

2000
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:29,119
available to you guys here really soon

2001
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:31,679
because right now the only available

2002
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:33,559
sizes are quite large and much more than

2003
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:36,119
the average hom grower whatever want or

2004
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:38,120
need but this stuff smells amazing as

2005
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:41,039
well so yeah this is probably my new

2006
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:43,840
favorite go-to spray now the one thing

2007
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:46,158
about that Dr Michael brownbridge was

2008
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,960
actually just telling me

2009
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:52,359
yesterday uh suffoil X or monor

2010
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:56,319
horiculture oil is actually effective at

2011
01:23:52,359 --> 01:23:58,880
um dealing with the the egg stage of

2012
01:23:56,319 --> 01:24:00,679
thrips now thrips lay their egg they can

2013
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,159
lay their eggs actually inside the leaf

2014
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:05,440
tissue and this will seem to block that

2015
01:24:03,158 --> 01:24:07,839
little hole that allows them to breathe

2016
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:10,079
before they emerge from the leaf

2017
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,440
tissue so that's where something like

2018
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:14,840
this would win out we're not seeing that

2019
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:17,759
same effect with the EPA Shield but EPA

2020
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:21,560
Shield has really good efficacy ac

2021
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:23,280
across almost all U cannabis pests so

2022
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:25,760
you can go to the website at bioworks

2023
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:28,000
and check out uh the entire label on it

2024
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,039
there but again really excited about and

2025
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,719
these are the two products that I like

2026
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,000
to use in my garden

2027
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,800
so all right I think I covered the

2028
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,719
majority of organic inputs that you can

2029
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,520
find uh that are available for your

2030
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:41,560
garden of course there's other ones out

2031
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,360
there feel free to ask any questions

2032
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:46,400
below in the comments and I'm happy to

2033
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:47,839
try and answer them as well um but yeah

2034
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:51,158
if you want to start playing around and

2035
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:53,960
mixing your own soils or utilizing

2036
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:55,879
organic amendments um this is a great

2037
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:59,239
way to get going I hope that was helpful

2038
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,239
thanks guys
