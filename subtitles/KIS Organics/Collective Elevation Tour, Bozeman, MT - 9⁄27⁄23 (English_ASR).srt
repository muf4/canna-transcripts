1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:09,280
[Music]

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,160
so when they bought this land probably 5

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:16,039
years ago the only thing on this

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,759
property was this barn out here and the

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,359
big wooden structure and that was an old

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,720
grain silo um so there wasn't water

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,519
there wasn't any power and it was just

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:29,160
kind of a wide open field so oh wow all

9
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,159
of this has happened in the last five

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,399
years few other things like Alpha Beta

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,399
the first thing we built has now been

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,719
taken down yeah yeah the original

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,160
Greenhouse that we had kind of built uh

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,920
that's nice though because I just Vis

15
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,119
visited Paradise Organics you know and

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,399
they're retrofitting into a building so

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,799
you have all these you know things are

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,920
not necessarily where you want them to

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,640
be and that's really common yeah in this

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760
and there was there still is a lot of

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,799
that here cuz I mean there was so many

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,960
different stages of this build you know

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,479
first it was the little Greenhouse that

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,960
we built with just

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,798
a generator and you know plug in power

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,960
tools and dig borrowed us an

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,840
extension the first lifts when we were

28
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:13,959
building we didn't have

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,079
power Char Ros extens she's a sweetheart

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,719
to for us to move in we originally going

31
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,280
to put it in the back field but the

32
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,280
first Outlet to get power was like

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,759
$40,000 just to bring it in and we were

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,439
like we had enough money for half of

35
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,439
this Warehouse building in that Nexus

36
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,599
and that was our first because

37
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,959
everything before that was the Old Farm

38
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,239
which was just hoop houses off grd most

39
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:40,719
sustainable Farm but comes with some St

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,719
wood stes at 3 a.m. yeah

41
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:53,039
yeah so yeah and you can see this is was

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,519
kind of like the start of the second

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:01,840
stage was this back half and then the

44
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,840
other Nexus that's connected to this

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,880
and then it was the third stage was that

46
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,840
building so we added another 3,000 ft

47
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:14,159
onto that and the fourth stage which

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,719
where we're going to now is uh we built

49
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,878
this as soon as we heard or as soon as

50
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,598
recreational passed in Montana yeah um

51
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:26,318
this was our project you know Danny does

52
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:28,280
all the facilities he's you know doing

53
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,518
anything that a breaks down or designing

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,840
any of the plumbing anything like that

55
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,480
uh but we also have Jared who does all

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,319
of our flowering green houses we've got

57
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,079
Connor and Woody who manage the

58
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,839
propagation Department which is Mom's

59
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,920
and then we've got Sawyer who does IPM

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,920
so they've kind of taken it a little

61
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:51,439
further than either of us originally

62
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:54,119
just because at the scale you are

63
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,759
specializing so each of these beds rep

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,920
represents one of our Banger strains

65
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,759
that we replicate and continue to grow

66
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,679
you'll see that we're in a system right

67
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,439
now we're in a complete revamp to make

68
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,400
our mul layer something more sustainable

69
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:12,519
um and hopefully reusable um it what's

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,920
really caused this was having shortages

71
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,920
and cocoa and and we knew we wanted to

72
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,719
eventually over the time over the years

73
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,439
we've done uh living mulches You Know

74
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,199
cover crops we've done wood chips but if

75
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,439
you do two wood chips four runs in a row

76
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,199
with these year round green houses

77
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,519
you're going to get obvious problems

78
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,759
with potentially nitrogen robbing it

79
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,879
doesn't break down we want to evolve to

80
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,679
a system where we're either using

81
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,000
something reusable that's roll up and

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,599
put and you can put it back down or

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,239
we'll rotate through cocoa one time that

84
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,719
gets stirred in uh wood chips one time

85
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,560
we've played around with recycling our

86
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,959
own hemp fiber but all that does is clog

87
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,280
up wood chippers

88
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:55,920
so we're in R&amp;D on both scrog systems

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,640
mulch systems and what's our third uh

90
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,039
Rock for those the two those were the

91
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,759
two ones I thought we had one more um

92
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,840
for

93
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,798
R&amp;D those are the main things that we're

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,759
still like trying to develop something

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,640
that's scalable reusable and works well

96
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,438
um first of all we'll if possible we'll

97
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,279
scrape some of that mul that wood chip

98
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:17,879
off that's why we'll only use wood chips

99
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,599
once a year I don't ever use them in the

100
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,680
mom room because wood chips come from

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,439
outside at a nursery and we ain't

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,560
messing with that that's why another

103
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,279
reason why we kind of like Coco but wood

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,399
chips we'll use them and you'll see them

105
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,599
in our in our hoop houses uh great thing

106
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,519
because we're only running one run a

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,879
year in there and those wood chips

108
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,599
aren't uh haven't been a factor at all

109
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,800
at the end of the season but I think

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,759
when you're getting four Cycles a year

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,520
or four and a half you're much more

112
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,840
likely to have that issue and so the big

113
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,000
thing we do is we don't use wood chips a

114
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,359
lot um we'll only use it maybe once a

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,120
year Coco was our tried and true even

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,038
though it was kind of expensive um it's

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,478
a

118
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,279
byproduct and it just get stirred right

119
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,839
back into the soil when we amend so

120
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,279
we'll test these pretty frequently

121
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,399
usually two weeks for Harvest in the

122
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,239
greenh houses uh as needed for these if

123
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,478
there's any issues or when he's sending

124
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,360
soil tests in um Connor will take core

125
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,279
samples of all this and send those in

126
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,600
too um otherwise this because it's

127
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,839
consistent that's one reason we don't

128
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,160
have Mom room in a greenhouse is

129
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,679
consistency year round this is one of

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
the only like year round air conditioned

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,079
spots that we have and it's just so that

132
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
we don't have to hit a moving Target

133
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,918
with varying light intensities and

134
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,079
temperatures and humidi where Mom room

135
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:34,120
needs to be consistent so when you

136
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:37,000
remend your soil testing and then mixing

137
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,038
the nutrients and the cocoa for M layer

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,360
back no will Top dress the uh it'll be

139
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,399
after the re amending yep so we'll top

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,560
dress put the craft mix down uh

141
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,758
sometimes we'll lightly stir that in

142
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,160
sometimes it'll just kind of stay on the

143
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,520
top and get watered in depends on if

144
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,039
it's caking that's based off soil test

145
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,560
the soil tests uh you can see Jared's

146
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,360
soil calculator if you want he's kind of

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,519
made his own version of

148
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,000
you know all those other ones um and so

149
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,598
we'll amend based on those obviously mom

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,519
rooms a little bit different uh

151
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:13,240
prescription than the flowering rooms

152
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,519
we'll top dress that essentially craft

153
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,199
mix just a series of of all our base

154
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:21,959
amendments then we'll plant um and we'll

155
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,160
put the cocoa on after and then the mom

156
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,519
room gets all handw watered everything

157
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,479
else has irrigation okay so then at the

158
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,038
end of the

159
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,959
cycle the plants

160
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:35,719
testing soil is the soil staying here in

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,198
this room and then like I see him with a

162
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,880
shovel over

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,639
there trans see have you already dug in

164
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,719
some nutrients yes but let's go ask

165
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,280
them how's it going

166
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,360
Woody how's it going good this is Tad

167
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,279
hussy he's uh Tad how's going he was

168
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,560
just asking if you have already uh

169
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,519
amended this uh bed as you're doing your

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,160
top as you're doing your planting so

171
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,799
yeah we just started like a chart we

172
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,800
numbered all the beds so we can keep

173
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,240
track of like monthly for how often beds

174
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,280
are needing food so these these beds I

175
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,519
just PL out of them today so the new

176
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,878
ones that are going in are the ones that

177
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,758
were here got amended a little over a

178
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,639
month ago so we're going to just add

179
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,520
some as we transplant them today to

180
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,598
start them off and add some in there I

181
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,240
can see you have some yep it's it's just

182
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,360
a fish meal and gips

183
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Cy that's all you needed yeah yeah

184
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,319
that's kind of what we've been

185
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,759
as Amendment it's most

186
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,560
nitrogen in the mob room it's

187
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,879
like they start to get to Green don't do

188
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,120
anything if they start to get test and

189
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:54,360
we can top dress craft mix any kind the

190
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,360
cycle based

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,839
on we usually don't do any Leaf tissue

192
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,319
tests or anything like that not that we

193
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,239
haven't but

194
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,960
um doesn't seem so you're removing all

195
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
of this biom yep I'm not sure is this

196
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,598
the old moms is what you chopped out of

197
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,598
there or is

198
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:16,478
this so he just killed something that we

199
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,719
don't need so as we sit down every month

200
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,519
and plan out our next planting Cycles

201
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,400
maybe we have too much in inventory one

202
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,598
thing's not selling we'll balance that

203
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,120
maybe we have moms that have only been

204
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,038
used one time or not at all hopefully

205
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,038
not at all if we've done our job right

206
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,759
uh or hopefully not not at all

207
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:32,759
so

208
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,598
yeah how do we get them how are you

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,759
supporting them Danny made these unist

210
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,519
Strat because I I ran into this problem

211
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,600
trying to do pallets and tray and then

212
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,639
the plastic Palace just oh yeah handle

213
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,480
the weight the wheel weight yeah yeah uh

214
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,360
so uh unistra is my best friend uh I

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,680
mean since I've started growing uh about

216
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,519
eight years ago uh I've just started

217
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,958
using Unistrut for just about anything I

218
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,200
can it's so versatile easy to work with

219
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,199
and there's so many different uh types

220
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,920
of bracketry

221
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,879
huh yep yep throw your tray on there and

222
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:21,919
then so all of our uh so all of our beds

223
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,879
uh in our green houses too uh we built

224
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,838
you know pretty much a very similar

225
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,679
design uh except for they're not on

226
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,360
Wheels yeah that's look great I love how

227
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:36,399
clean you guys keep in here that drain y

228
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,399
having that drain is awesome

229
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,719
yeah so these were actually just plugged

230
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,719
yesterday

231
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,000
um so

232
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,079
yeah so they'll obviously top all the

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,159
moms move it into here it'll spend uh

234
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:57,919
you know usually approximately 14 days

235
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:59,600
sometimes 12 um until we are rooted and

236
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,799
ready to go at that Point they'll get

237
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
moved into the bedroom the reason we

238
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,639
obviously bring you into the tissue

239
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,278
culture room first the mom room second

240
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:11,319
the Clone room third and then we'll go

241
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:13,278
to the bedroom um it has more flow as a

242
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,120
harvest system and what we're doing is

243
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,039
we're following if you picture this grow

244
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,919
as a river we always start at the top of

245
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,958
the river Upstream top of the stream at

246
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,799
the cleanest spaces and we move through

247
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,359
just assuming that your oldest plants or

248
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,639
your harvested plants have the most

249
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,759
potential to be what we would consider

250
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:32,278
unclean um so it flows better with the

251
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,799
grow and the Harvest than it does with

252
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,480
the tour because we end up zigzagging

253
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,319
our our greenos are all staggered three

254
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,759
weeks apart and so we'll start at the

255
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,000
most freshly planted going to the most

256
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,559
uh soon to be harvested at the end and

257
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,120
those will it'll all flow according to

258
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,479
their age

259
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,159
class so you're just using these look

260
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,519
like Costco shop yeah actually these

261
00:10:54,159 --> 00:11:00,439
lights were um we got a bunch of these

262
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,200
lights with the tissue culture La kit

263
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,200
okay so and we just had a bunch of

264
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,399
extras and we were like ah and this has

265
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,560
been enough light for them uh yeah we've

266
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,399
noticed if we give them any more light

267
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,159
they tend to Yellow out a little bit

268
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,200
harder so they definitely liked you know

269
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,199
less light from what we've been seeing

270
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,800
we've tried a few different of uh you

271
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,560
know you know the Lux LED lights the

272
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,879
Clone lights um you know a few different

273
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,439
you know your typical you know single

274
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,838
t5s and then you know these been

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,240
actually working pretty well for us all

276
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
the looks where we're getting yellowed

277
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,839
out in the middle um and maybe it's just

278
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,320
cuz you know we could probably DW that

279
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,320
in and feed more

280
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,959
but this is this why would you uh

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Advance anything past or buy more

282
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,638
expensive lighting when this is just

283
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,639
done the trick so perfectly for

284
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:56,320
us and then are you dipping the cuts in

285
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:59,560
anything y yeah uh zerall zerall and I

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,240
want to say a panic for a dunk and as

287
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,239
far as a rooting hormone oh God we've

288
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,639
gone through everything what are we

289
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,440
using right now well currently we're

290
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,440
using the uh the Athena rooting hor oh

291
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,200
really y so we've tried every single

292
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,920
thing possible including nothing had

293
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,600
just about as good of results yep we

294
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,000
rotate through we used to do aloe a lot

295
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,399
of the things that we used to do that

296
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,958
were more

297
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,639
um k&amp;f didn't scale that well at least

298
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,399
not an effective Manner and so we've

299
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,919
kind of like phased out certain you know

300
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,039
even what we found is we can get away

301
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,479
with less te's we used to be just you

302
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,919
you can imagine this scale what kind of

303
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,720
te's we're brewing and we've kind of

304
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,719
spend doing less and less of those and

305
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,240
I've seen no negative results from that

306
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,720
either so

307
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,680
yeah so this is a bedroom these are all

308
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,759
en rolling tables we usually do 6in pots

309
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,399
this is where we found um we used to

310
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,319
make all of our own soil for the whole

311
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,958
facility and this is actually where the

312
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,760
most impact for us has been for kiss

313
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,599
soil is what we found we cannot make it

314
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,480
and have the same we showed you those

315
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,399
pictures uh a couple years ago of like

316
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,120
the side by sides and it was noticeable

317
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,839
at scale a couple times in a row and at

318
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,360
that point we started buying kiss every

319
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,959
time for our veg soil uh even though

320
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,440
obviously we don't have huge soil needs

321
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,198
once our living soil systems are in

322
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
place I mean at this scale there still

323
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,319
quite a bit and that's part of why we

324
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,800
use six inch pots um we can almost get

325
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,160
just as good a growth in two weeks two

326
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,319
to three weeks in a vroom and two weeks

327
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,879
it V in the greenhouse be letting them

328
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,600
tap in before flipping with our four

329
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,120
green houses you end up having a harvest

330
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,959
every 3 weeks so if these spend two

331
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,839
weeks in here you always have three days

332
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:42,278
on either end to clean run or if

333
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,040
something ever gets pushed you've got a

334
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:45,919
little bit of a window we do have

335
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,559
another bedroom for spring planting

336
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,039
season that's the same size and we'll

337
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,638
use that if we need to but generally

338
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,278
speaking we're trying to have a high

339
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,360
utilization rate on our vedro high

340
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,360
utilization rate on our clone room and

341
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,278
our system is all planned pretty much

342
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,278
perfectly for where we're at right

343
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,319
now so this is our first round of an

344
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,799
experiment with a new multilayer that we

345
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,639
were hoping to be reusable we can

346
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,958
already see there's some flaws in this

347
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,278
this is a recycled hemp fiber that Danny

348
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,879
found yep okay

349
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:21,480
um so that a lot of well a lot of the

350
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,799
people are using this for micro greens

351
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,159
and whatnot but there's a company out of

352
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:30,599
Canada uh Terra fiber that makes a lot

353
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:33,799
of these mats uh for as far as weed

354
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,399
suppression um for micro greens um

355
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:39,439
erosion control um so I kind of thought

356
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,198
it'd be kind of fun to test it out as a

357
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,199
mulch layer um what are your thoughts on

358
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,838
it right now uh right now you know I

359
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,439
don't know if we'll stick to it I don't

360
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,000
know if we'll go back to it I mean it

361
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,440
was kind of a really cool thought uh in

362
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,600
using it um I don't think it's going to

363
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,120
be very easy to pull them back out of

364
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,879
the beds after the round is over and

365
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,399
then reuse them we need two runs to be

366
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,159
competitive with the price of Coco it

367
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,440
looks like it'll just pull right out but

368
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,719
those roots are going to grow into the

369
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,279
bottom with a bunch of soil there's no

370
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,560
way you're rolling up that much and then

371
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,480
how are you going to pressure wash it in

372
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,638
the winter there's some rubber stuff but

373
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,360
I'm a little bit worried about like

374
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,320
leeching that we could you know like

375
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,360
rubber matting so this is a mat yeah yep

376
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,800
just rip open oh okay and then also I'm

377
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,440
concerned that it's going to do what

378
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,879
Pete Moss would also do which is hold a

379
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
lot of moisture on the top and kind of

380
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,720
become a sponge and instead of like just

381
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,318
trapping it it's going to actually

382
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,040
evaporate into the air which defeats the

383
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:41,479
whole point that's why we're pretty well

384
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,879
deed up for for winter runs in here and

385
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,600
that the

386
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,600
main the main reason for this then is

387
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,240
just moisture retention yeah y That's

388
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,120
your biggest thing battle here in the

389
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,120
community y okay is we don't want it a

390
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,839
in the air that could then promote uh

391
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,278
Milo or just battling making our

392
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,600
dehumidifiers uh work excess but also

393
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:03,879
what we'll find and we'll show you in

394
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,159
zone three there is when we don't have

395
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,240
any mulch you start to get exposed roots

396
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,719
a little bit of compaction and you're

397
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,839
way more like it's so much harder to

398
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,199
read that um first of all soil moisture

399
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,399
because the Top's always dry and you you

400
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,399
get Dy off in those that top surface

401
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,639
layer you'll start to get uh a little

402
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,000
bit more yellowing at inconsistent times

403
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,680
or a little bit faster it's it's it just

404
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,839
becomes harder to read it it you lose

405
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,758
your stability when you're evaporating

406
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,040
that much soil and and you're more like

407
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,120
just have Regional uh attrition you know

408
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,919
certain leaves will fade out a week or

409
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,519
two before you want them versus that and

410
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,198
the beauty of Coco was it could just be

411
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,959
stirred in and game on I mean I love the

412
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,919
idea of a mulch but what I struggle with

413
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,399
is when I want the biggest the biggest

414
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,000
thing on scale is being able to re amend

415
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,519
those BS quickly and be able to just mix

416
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,078
whatever it is into the media Without

417
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,198
Really changing your

418
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:59,519
physical yeah so I could see where Coco

419
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,919
might work for that because

420
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,480
yeah it's not very sustainable and

421
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,480
that's kind of what we're looking for is

422
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,400
a more sustainable you know long-term

423
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,759
users that we can reuse it's sustainable

424
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,199
in that it's a byproduct but not in that

425
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,038
we have to ship it here and it's

426
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,439
footprint on it is is pretty terrible

427
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,798
and we're trying to revisit all these

428
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,000
things and find um coste efficient

429
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,759
Alternatives besides just as as this

430
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,240
Market gets more and more competitive

431
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,879
first of all having a living soil system

432
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
is going to be never having to replace

433
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,559
this soil after and oh by the way these

434
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,480
two greenh houses are all kiss soil um

435
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:39,279
yep yep this was the big order we put in

436
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,759
with you yeah and uh what we found is we

437
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,519
got these finished out two months before

438
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,919
recreational was launching and typically

439
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,079
we would have uh built our own soil and

440
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,080
we had prepped to do that we were not in

441
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,759
a position during Harvest to do that and

442
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,199
then after testing it in the bedroom and

443
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,200
seeing what happened it was like we

444
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,558
pulled the trigger on you know scale and

445
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,279
Bo Bo we haven't looked back as far as

446
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,879
that's concerned yeah I think you saw

447
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,480
the lights just kicked on yeah what was

448
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,000
that about this uh Wadsworth system that

449
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,558
we have which is our control system

450
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,679
there's a light sensor right there that

451
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,960
blue thing and because it's cloudy out

452
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,919
so these uh LED lights are all dimmable

453
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,919
so obviously it's cloudy right now uh

454
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,240
typically these are only one week into

455
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,400
uh they've been they were transplanted

456
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,640
one week ago so they're still just at

457
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,840
the end of their shock phase this is the

458
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,120
first day that the curtains the lights

459
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,918
have been open all the way and or the

460
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,759
curtains have been open all the way and

461
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,280
the parameters just got turned up just a

462
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,839
little bit to like four 500 par so

463
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,359
that's why these are now kicking on this

464
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,639
winter we're going to drop these lights

465
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,158
actually a little bit because they're

466
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,120
dimable we maybe went a little high and

467
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,440
a little under lit a little conservative

468
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,519
on three three Cycles a year this is

469
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,640
great with all the supplemental Sun but

470
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,519
if you have a cold cloudy

471
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,880
December we're maybe just a little

472
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,240
deficient on light we called you last

473
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,360
winter when we had that issue and I

474
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,480
think

475
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,918
between the CO2 two burer being kicked

476
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,960
on at a time when they were already

477
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,559
underperforming with their power levels

478
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,840
and we uh maybe were a little actually

479
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,678
deficient on our soil tests yeah

480
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,158
whatever M and the humidity was really

481
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,759
high because we were it was Winter and

482
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,400
you end up getting high humidity in the

483
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,200
winter we're always battling that that's

484
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,519
why there's you know quite a bit of

485
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,000
there's more than my all my vehicles

486
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,200
I've ever bought in the humidifiers in

487
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,919
this facility you know what I mean and

488
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,200
that's for largely three months a year

489
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,840
the rest of the time we're running super

490
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,360
efficient you know and I mean Montana is

491
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,959
a great climate for wet walls with our

492
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,119
you know warm dry but not too hot walk

493
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,319
down there and take a look at that

494
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,038
absolutely so this is Danny and this is

495
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:47,720
a great example of where we all like

496
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,720
design out big systems and we wanted to

497
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,440
maximize our square footage in canopy so

498
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,360
these greenh houses are actually 4200

499
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,759
square feet those other ones are 3,000

500
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,119
if I were to do it all over they'd all

501
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,000
be 3500 we'd have instead of having six

502
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,199
rows and four rows we'd have five in

503
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,359
each one they'd have perfect consistency

504
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,759
but this is example where what we found

505
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,399
was with our dehes back there not

506
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,759
blocking light we were starting to get

507
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,159
mildew in the winter time on the front

508
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:14,319
rows where we were maybe having not as

509
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,679
good a cycling at that time we had baf

510
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,480
fans or uh yeah vaf fans Not HF fans

511
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,400
yeah so what we

512
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,159
did in this size we have them on the

513
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,640
other one because they worked just fine

514
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,880
here we weren't being able to stir our

515
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,480
air well enough so we added everything

516
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,240
we could so we started first we added

517
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,720
more dehumidifiers then we added uh we

518
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,720
reconfigured our air flow uh then it was

519
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,519
summer and we didn't have any problems

520
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,200
and we thought we figured it out then

521
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,918
last winter we added these and now what

522
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,200
we're doing is we're flipping sooner and

523
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,440
throwing shorter canopies especially

524
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,558
during that winter month but we're going

525
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,798
to have to drop the lights in order to

526
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,519
do that so we

527
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,250
are we'll never have a problem again I

528
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,519
know

529
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:57,119
[Laughter]

530
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,720
it we solved every issue

531
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:02,879
so you can see these have already had

532
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,120
their uh transplant Leaf up they've been

533
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,520
uh uh these have all been pruned from

534
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,239
the bottom um one week in we've been

535
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,720
really good at avoiding transplant shock

536
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,319
you can still see the remnants on a

537
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,919
touch of saggy leaves but overall if

538
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,519
they had even a little bit of micro

539
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,400
yelling at this point I wouldn't be

540
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,440
concerned uh these beds are like rehab

541
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,240
to them even if they were to get

542
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,038
unhealthy which we don't let them um

543
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,480
they tap in and and two weeks later we

544
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:33,519
flip

545
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,480
CO2 levels Elevate at night yes with

546
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,359
this much soil in room yeah oh yeah that

547
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,519
that's we

548
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,240
don't in the summer um depends if they

549
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,679
get too high uh we will have you know

550
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,000
some on occasions uh fans will kind of

551
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,278
burp the greenhouse um and kind of

552
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,480
maintain there but um they don't go up

553
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:56,119
too too high

554
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,038
um empty Greenhouse in an empty

555
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,038
Greenhouse yeah yeah yeah

556
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:07,278
um but uh no they generally will come up

557
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:11,200
to about you know anywhere from 600 to

558
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:14,000
700 ppms at at night now the well the

559
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,360
interesting thing though is an empty

560
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,679
Greenhouse will outperform these beds

561
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,798
with no plants to suck up all that CO2

562
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,840
will outperform that CO2 burner all day

563
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,720
long we can get it up to like 12 and

564
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,119
1500 on an empty Greenhouse right after

565
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,600
we've turned the beds or uh amended in

566
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,599
new microbes

567
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,038
and for the first year now there's a

568
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,158
little bit more volume on these green

569
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:36,440
houses but there's also correspondingly

570
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,760
more soil our beds that we made that

571
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,360
were more mature outperformed CO2 Wise

572
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,319
from a CO2 production standpoint

573
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,879
significantly over the kiss Organics now

574
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,720
I haven't seen any dramatic differences

575
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,278
I think it actually has to like the soil

576
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,319
almost produces more CO2 or or our

577
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,400
sensors are off but for a long time the

578
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,480
kiss Greenhouse is empty would only get

579
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,600
up to 600 00 and the nexuses would get

580
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:08,400
up to 12 13400 at night about that

581
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,399
actually yeah pretty interesting

582
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:14,359
um so all these floor fans too it's just

583
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,559
max air flow that we cannot get enough

584
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:20,918
as long as it's not blasting on the

585
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:23,678
plants wet walls um perfect for this

586
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,400
climate we are hot we're dry you use a

587
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,759
wet wall in Florida you can't get that

588
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,640
but first of all we hardly ever have a

589
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,759
day over 90 anyway

590
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,960
one or two a summer and we could get

591
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,278
this 20 or 30° cooler than ambient

592
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,759
anytime we want we've never been too hot

593
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:41,278
unless a breaker blue or a you know what

594
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,679
I mean and if we do get alarms four or

595
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,119
five different cultivators will'll say

596
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,120
oh it's too hot in zone four what's

597
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,639
going on uh here you can

598
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,199
see the green houses now these lights

599
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,799
are reading on different Cycles what we

600
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,960
found especially in these North Green

601
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,158
Houses was the winter sun was getting

602
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,880
blocked on the south two rows so when we

603
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,760
programed these lights I had these two

604
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,400
put on his own in those four so they'll

605
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,679
actually read and I can set them

606
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,320
differently um it's less applicable to

607
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,360
the South Greenhouse but especially in

608
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,798
that North Greenhouse those lights will

609
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,639
be running 24 hours a day even or not 24

610
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:15,119
12 hours a day and on a sunny day the

611
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,278
north for Rosa lights will just let the

612
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,759
sun take over as needed and the Shaded

613
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,359
sections of a green us so we can really

614
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,519
micromanage accordingly with our

615
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,839
settings and of course now we can do it

616
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,359
from our phone with the Wadsworth system

617
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:30,839
you can have every single parameter

618
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:34,599
you've got outside you've got Zone 1 2 3

619
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,599
4 temperature humidity um your power

620
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,959
levels your

621
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,319
VPD and your CO2 levels right now on a

622
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,840
day like today or in the summer we won't

623
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:46,798
run CO2 burners at all because it's just

624
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,199
it's a fart in the wind but uh this big

625
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,639
change here is that instead of the old

626
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,360
days of having to stoke wood stoves at

627
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,919
midnight 3 and 6 a.m. now if I wake up

628
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,199
in the middle of the night on a 40 below

629
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,360
night in the middle of

630
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,200
winter I can look at get this and just

631
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,558
make sure that everything's okay and

632
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,558
there's no

633
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:08,080
emergencies yeah Green Crack that's

634
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,839
sativa leaning this is Don Fuego this is

635
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,398
a strain that we bred out of two of our

636
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,759
Legends which are one of our bestselling

637
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:15,000
Cannabis Cup winning strains which is

638
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,839
donni burger and sweet and sour which is

639
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,278
strain we bred ourselves and this is the

640
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,639
baby of that and so we're trying to

641
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,240
always stay ahead of it we proved it

642
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,000
over in my shop this is only the first

643
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,679
commercial run we've ever done of it um

644
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,480
and we're pretty excited about it new

645
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,038
release coming up Don Fuego but you can

646
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,200
really see strain specific sativa time

647
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,079
as you walk towards the more indas

648
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,759
you'll see that short that stacking

649
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,000
they're way further along eventually

650
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,000
we're going to plant just green houses

651
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,278
of sativas just green houses at indas

652
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,759
but we actually like that Harvest

653
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,960
spacing right now for the size of our

654
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,519
cruise to be able to do a a 5-day

655
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,200
Harvest and I can even spread it over 10

656
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,679
days depending on my timing but

657
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,120
eventually it's going to make more sense

658
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,399
for perfect utilization of veg and clone

659
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:02,479
rooms to have

660
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,479
uh 70-day green houses and 60-day Green

661
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,759
Houses we don't have significant

662
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,399
problems and we stick to our system we

663
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,398
don't go looking for them too much I

664
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:12,959
can't tell you how many times people

665
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:14,959
have brought me a uh immature aphid or a

666
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,840
winged aphid and everyone loses their

667
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,200
[ __ ] and more often than not the living

668
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,959
soil system handles any pests you're

669
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,038
usually able to get through it

670
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,840
and we don't if we did our job right all

671
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,519
up until there as far as bugs are

672
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,278
concerned

673
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,440
either we don't have to worry about them

674
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:36,159
or the ones there are are so minimal or

675
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,399
so minuscule that uh launching a war

676
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,600
halfway through flower when we've got

677
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:42,558
more green houses coming has in fact

678
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,240
done us more good than bad we have

679
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,558
insecticidal soap root drenched plants

680
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,960
and more bad than good or so more bad

681
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:52,879
than good thank you we have incal root

682
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,360
drenched plants because of uh soil

683
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,960
aphids that people told us were roote

684
00:26:54,359 --> 00:27:00,158
aphids that weren't and we just about

685
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,759
fried a whole greenhouse and it our

686
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,080
treatments have literally done more

687
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,000
damage when we go aggressive out of our

688
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:09,319
comfort

689
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,038
zone uh and do more than a small tester

690
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:14,359
we do more damage than good so we don't

691
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:15,679
panic and and like I said if you put

692
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,719
that soil in a microscope someone

693
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,080
professional is going to tell me there's

694
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,679
something to be scared of in there well

695
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,199
I mean the health of the plants tell you

696
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,360
everything another interesting thing to

697
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,558
note uh Golden Goat very specifically is

698
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,119
one of our best prayers in This Kiss

699
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,480
soil and I believe a lot of it is our

700
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,918
light it tends to get this light crab

701
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,399
cloth I think we reduce our

702
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,440
transpiration by not having as intense

703
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:40,079
of light um and and but for the longest

704
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,798
time I was like maybe this kiss soil is

705
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,519
like too rich or I I couldn't figure out

706
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:49,879
why my best prey and strain had it's

707
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,558
subtle but it's there and I think it's

708
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,240
our light intensity this dropping of the

709
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:54,240
light uh we're just slightly out of our

710
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,359
perameter and this is one of our

711
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,720
indicators also because it's a short one

712
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:00,798
it doesn't get quite as much light to

713
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,798
say Donnie Burger you

714
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,720
know this greenhouse though a little bit

715
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:19,319
smaller we typically have way less

716
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,360
problems with mildew or anything of that

717
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,359
nature um oh here we go right

718
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,159
here freak Show it's got seeds in

719
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,880
it that's also the first thing that's

720
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,919
going to Herm if you have it um I used

721
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,960
to think that some of our oldest strains

722
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:42,278
would get that and that they did have HP

723
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,720
but they I haven't ever seen any

724
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:47,359
significant impacts from that

725
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,079
specifically and furthermore uh I have

726
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,599
brand new fenos that we just pheno

727
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,119
hunted and they'll randomly do that on

728
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:56,439
the second run in a green in my shop

729
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,398
so I don't know what it is never tracked

730
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,840
it down doesn't actually impact that

731
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,199
much but it is a curiosity that

732
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,240
everybody who's known their salt has

733
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,558
always wanted to blame on HP Lon and

734
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,278
it's not been the

735
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:12,918
case so yeah four strains one two three

736
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,240
four or is there five five strains in

737
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,759
this green house these are actually

738
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,480
pretty lower test some this is one of my

739
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,759
favorite strains smell that forbidden

740
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,480
fruit it's so that living soil really

741
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:27,599
brings out those

742
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,480
turs um but it tests 16% it's one of our

743
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,278
that good but I think we're about to win

744
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,360
Award with the joints supp from it so

745
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,359
that's why we're growing this is

746
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:39,720
to

747
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,679
absolutely that's why Donny Burger which

748
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,880
is 33% gets grown in every single

749
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,000
Greenhouse even though I between you and

750
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,720
me hate to grow it it's the worst

751
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,359
linkiest least producing finicky little

752
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,720
thing you've ever seen it's not that bad

753
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:59,079
but it sucks Danny what's your favorite

754
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:03,038
cult oh boy uh honestly the forbidden

755
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:05,359
fruit the forbidden fruit it's uh it's

756
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:09,319
I'm not personally a big fan of high

757
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:12,439
testing you know THC um my those days

758
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:14,000
are over for me uh I would much rather

759
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,278
you know to have a higher turpine

760
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,720
profile and just you know still be able

761
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:21,440
to function golden goat's my second

762
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,558
favorite it's got that it's Island skunk

763
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,320
I mean just smell it it smells like it

764
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:29,200
belongs in Hawaii you know um and this

765
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,639
this is a sativa one not a particularly

766
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,278
Frosty she's late to the party on um but

767
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,919
it's a legend and stood the test of time

768
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:38,640
even though this is only like a

769
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,679
22er she still stays on the shelves cuz

770
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,519
this is a Montana cult classic

771
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,840
absolutely a legend

772
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,200
strain so we'll go from basically it

773
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:50,558
gets harvested it all gets wheeled in on

774
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,798
um dry flower

775
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,720
hangers so we've reduced a whole bunch

776
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,759
of touch points on this Farm by just the

777
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,639
Harvest crew will hang it in a dry flow

778
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:03,398
on these dry flow RS right here okay it

779
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:05,278
used to be what is this this is a dry

780
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:08,359
flow hanger these are amazing and here's

781
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,398
another uh interesting this goes here uh

782
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:12,240
dry

783
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:16,158
power company let me get oh my camera's

784
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,519
going okay dry fler that guy's awesome

785
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,200
he made these originally kind of for

786
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,960
hemp um this has been a game changer for

787
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,278
us as far as reducing touch points at

788
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,399
the farm it used to be that you would

789
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,759
Harvest put it in a bin bring it over to

790
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:29,319
somebody at a station

791
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,440
they would take it out of the bin they

792
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:33,079
would Leaf all their plants it would get

793
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,278
stuck in another bin brought to the

794
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,199
drying room hung on some sort of screen

795
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,038
system so each branch had to be hung

796
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,440
manually by hand and then when they go

797
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,278
to take it off after 14 days they got to

798
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,120
unthread out of the netting or ropes

799
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,558
while with this you reduce all those

800
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,439
touch points they harvest it they leave

801
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,720
it right there they stick it on a dry

802
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,840
flower rack it goes onto here which gets

803
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,440
pushed in now then you just take the

804
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,839
whole thing here and the real Beauty in

805
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,399
the system it used to be a giant straw

806
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:07,759
you touch every Branch one more time

807
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:11,038
here you take this half you throw it a

808
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,919
bin take this half you throw it a bin

809
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,919
you literally can just strip these down

810
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,840
then it can be [ __ ] process we Rel

811
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,639
three entire touch points with the dry

812
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,119
flower system it's and you can now fit

813
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,439
just as much room we have every kind of

814
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,599
infrastructure you can imagine you know

815
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,480
and I've tried with winches on racks

816
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:27,480
that raise the whole thing as you load

817
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,679
it so you don't have to be up on a

818
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,319
ladder and dry FL it's like the [ __ ]

819
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,320
when you get a product that you really

820
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,720
love that makes your life easier it's

821
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,000
totally worth promoting it and then

822
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,480
another interesting thing this is where

823
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,359
there's so much space in this industry

824
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,759
for renovation and Innovation is that

825
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:49,839
when we first ordered these they would

826
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:51,638
send these aluminum uh sh lengths of of

827
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,119
light because of shipping cost and it

828
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:55,839
was more than the price of the dry flow

829
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,119
hangers which is what I want was these

830
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,678
metal things well Danny was like look if

831
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:02,239
you just cut Danny clipped them all and

832
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,798
he made them work on unistra and then he

833
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
told dryflow hey instead of having to

834
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,200
spend twice as much on shipping just

835
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,519
send everybody these and make it

836
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,798
Unistrut which is available at every

837
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,440
Home Depot and you already know Danny's

838
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,200
love for Unistrut yeah so then they

839
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,639
custom made notches for us which I just

840
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
found out they stopped doing but I don't

841
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:21,398
know why because that changes his whole

842
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,880
game now you I mean there can't be very

843
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:25,158
much money in just giving all of it to

844
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,679
shipping like it's way easier to ship

845
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,159
thousands of these than it is these long

846
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,880
lengths so just those little things of

847
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,320
like don't use some aluminum prefabbed

848
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,039
specific size thing use a readily

849
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,558
available building material that is at

850
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:40,079
every you know and so so these are all

851
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,839
this is off right now but you can see

852
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:46,359
there's air flow air

853
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,879
flow air conditioner humidifier

854
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:52,839
dehumidifier it's got all the things to

855
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,440
keep it at 60% in these 60 uh degrees

856
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,959
and Summer and the winter even with

857
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,320
seasonal

858
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,679
fluctuations so this is the same thing

859
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,398
except for they just took this down

860
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,320
bucked it now it's going to sit here

861
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:09,199
while it waits to be trimmed so this is

862
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:11,199
where we'll put all of our flour it'll

863
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,960
uh basically it's been it's kind of

864
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,598
curing now it'll be trimmed sometime in

865
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,599
the next week

866
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,960
um get a little more in here same deal

867
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,638
waiting for bucking um it just sits in

868
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,720
these bins um closed up this is one

869
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,159
whole Greenhouse in here yep that's one

870
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,519
green

871
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,519
house mostly

872
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:40,519
anyway yeah so this is where we process

873
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:43,320
all capsules carts um and sometimes

874
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,079
package pre-orders for wholesale um this

875
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,599
is a capsule brand that we're just about

876
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,519
to release in Montana it's uh going on

877
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,399
people's shelves here probably within

878
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,918
the week and it's finally just Master

879
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,440
packed out and ready for uh retail ready

880
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,319
sales um it's a niche in the market that

881
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,960
isn't what represented it's not a huge

882
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
portion of the market but there's nobody

883
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,159
in that space so awesome and we already

884
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,279
have a big following with our capsules

885
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,879
and we already had all the Machinery so

886
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,519
it it makes perfect sense to be a

887
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,680
non-threatening third party brand that

888
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,199
is available on other people's shelves

889
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:16,000
now I heard here in Montana in the

890
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,199
dispensaries they call it dly style

891
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,760
because they just throw all the buds in

892
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:23,159
a jar and you not necessarily branded

893
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,599
that's only a few dispensaries actually

894
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,239
uh typically speaking like we're all

895
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,760
prepackaged now but we try and do that

896
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,000
in a fresh manner because it's just the

897
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,480
way the regulations have uh pushed us we

898
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,039
used to do deli style and some people

899
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,240
still do it's strain by strain you just

900
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,358
get a big jar and you pick what you want

901
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,879
and they weigh it out in front of you

902
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,159
you know and does that make it hard

903
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,760
though as a cultivator to build a brand

904
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,000
if you're a grower because they're just

905
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,640
throwing in jar they're not necessarily

906
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,760
promoting we typic we'll do two types of

907
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,920
wholesale one is packag and branded and

908
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,359
the way we avoid that is it goes in our

909
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,920
packaging before it leaves our facility

910
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,480
and then you don't have a choice um and

911
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,760
it kind of depends on which Market we're

912
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,199
in if it's a market we're already well

913
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,960
represented in we don't need to uh get

914
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,960
the brand or maybe we have something

915
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,318
that's starting to get 6 months old and

916
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,599
somebody wants to White Label it as

917
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:11,920
their own um in which case it's yours do

918
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:13,400
what you want with it but consumers are

919
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,639
looking on the shelves now for

920
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,200
Collective elevation because you've

921
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,559
built 100% we're uh as far as Montana

922
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,439
goes we're a reasonably renowned name

923
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,199
for our just even our open source

924
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,679
information of like just the cultivators

925
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,719
know who we are and now that those

926
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,399
cultivators are actually out selling

927
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,759
their capacity they're coming to us

928
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,838
often times first which is it's crucial

929
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,210
that's the future you know you have to

930
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:41,409
be retail ready and

931
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:41,409
[Music]

932
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,159
branded
