cultivation and science podcast and our

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,679
advertisers we can keep doing our part

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,539
to bridge the gap between research and

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,100
cultivation we are honored that you

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,840

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,378
guest this week is my good friend

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,840
Suzanne Wainwright Evans also known by

25
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,179
many as the bug lady she's an ornamental

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,859
entomologist specializing in integrated

27
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,299
Pest Management Suzanne has been

28
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,340
involved in the green industry for more

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,560
than 25 years with a primary focus on

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,600
biological controls and using pesticides

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
properly she is a graduate of the

32
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,839
University of Florida with degrees in

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,880
both entomology and environmental

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,618
Horticulture Suzanne has been on the

35
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,239
podcast multiple times and I highly

36
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:22,618
suggest folks go back and listen to some

37
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,959
of her other podcasts if you haven't

38
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,700
already this podcast though is a

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,500
two-part Series where we discuss some of

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,719
the latest research in cannabis and hemp

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,819
from a recent invite-only conference she

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,280
attended one of the biggest topics being

43
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,658
viruses and cannabis now on to the show

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,400
oh

45
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,380
hey Suzanne thanks for coming on the

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,380
show today well thanks for having me

47
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:47,039
it's always exciting to talk to you

48
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,019
you had called me uh recently on the

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,000
phone to tell me about a conference that

50
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,798
you had gone to up in Canada where there

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,478
were some new information and research

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,579
that come out that you wanted to share

53
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,259
with Growers

54
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,118
um so I'll just let you dive in and

55
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,079
explain some of the stuff that you

56
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,078
learned okay well

57
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,479
from Canada

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,459
um so that was probably where the

59
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,940
confusion happened it was actually at

60
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,620
Colorado State out in Fort Collins and

61
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,579
it was

62
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,819
um a hemp research meeting it's for the

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,560
researchers in western United States

64
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:27,419
that are working on hemp pass there were

65
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,180
some hemp researchers from the East

66
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:33,598
Coast there but it's the the people that

67
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,640
are focused on insects disease mites

68
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,919
nematodes and actually there were even

69
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,238
some presentations on

70
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:46,259
herbicide trials um

71
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:48,180
for outdoor fiber production because in

72
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,479
in that situation

73
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:55,560
trying to grow hundreds of acres of hemp

74
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:57,539
without an herbicide has is a really uh

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,000
big problem because the weeds are just

76
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,039
overtaking the hemp crop and you don't

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
get a harvestable crop because you know

78
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,579
some of these weeds I don't want to call

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,159
them quite super weeds but they can

80
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,760
overtake the hemp pretty easily

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,579
um

82
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,139
and so uh work needs to be done on that

83
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,500
because currently there are no

84
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,719
registered herbicides for hemp so the

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,340
researchers are doing the work there and

86
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,699
trying to figure out like what

87
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,219
pre-emergent herbicides can be used or

88
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,139
um more targeted herbicides that would

89
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:32,759
be safe to use for fiber hemp production

90
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:34,378
so it was a a combination of multiple

91
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,079
disciplines

92
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:39,658
which was super interesting but the the

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,900
thing that I found super interesting is

94
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:46,199
a friend slash colleague of mine from

95
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,000
Canada uh Dr zamir punja um he and I

96
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,098
have spoken together at a handful of

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,400
meetings uh he's with Simon Frazier

98
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:55,679
University and being that he's in Canada

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,140
he's got an advantage over some of the

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,180
U.S researchers because again notice I

101
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,179
said I was at a hemp meeting

102
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,280
um because we still have that same issue

103
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,140
where the university people can't really

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,219
work on cannabis they can only work on

105
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:13,559
hemp where up in Canada zamir

106
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,780
um can work on hemp and has been

107
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,019
actually doing a lot of his work in

108
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,298
actual cannabis production facilities

109
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,019
which really helps to give us a better

110
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,620
Real World perspective

111
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,339
on

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,220
um

113
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,319
on what's happening out there

114
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,820
um and one of the things that I found

115
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,620
super interesting and again I am not a

116
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,240
plant pathologist I will never pretend

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,300
to be one you guys know I will not

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,519
consult on Plant Pathology but I dangle

119
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,360
around the edge of it because I have

120
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,519
several friends that are plant

121
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,300
Pathologists and I do see a lot of

122
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:50,279
things out in the field is that when

123
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,540
they started looking at fuserium which

124
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,179
fuserium

125
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,400
has been a pretty bad problem in

126
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,019
cannabis and hemp

127
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,359
um that they're finding multiple

128
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,939
fusarium species most people just think

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,319
fusarium is fusarium but fusarium is not

130
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,579
fuserium

131
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,079
um most of the time when you look up

132
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,719
fusarium

133
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,478
um you are learning you come across

134
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,660
fusarium oxosporum that is one that we

135
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,500
commonly see in ornamental crops

136
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,320
um

137
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,779
and there is a significant amount of

138
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,038
research on it but they found zamir

139
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,939
found

140
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,219
in Canada that about when they find few

141
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,600
serum about 65 of the time it is access

142
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,759
Forum

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,160
um and so there are other fusarium

144
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,780
species out there

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,120
um and though again I'm not a plant

146
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,038
pathologist and I'm gonna uh butcher

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,379
this and I can already feel my friends

148
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,740
my plant pathologist friends cringing

149
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:51,860
when I want to pronounce this uh there's

150
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,860
a pro-lifer a team and it's

151
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,538
p-r-o-l-i-f-e-r-a-t-u-m they're finding

152
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,060
that few cerium about 25 of the time so

153
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:01,740
there's a 25 chance that that's the

154
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,319
fusarium you could be dealing with and

155
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,400
there's some other more obscure runs

156
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,478
um but just be aware that

157
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,579
um

158
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,680
you may need to do a little more digging

159
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,079
if you are dealing with you serium and

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,400
you may need to get tested

161
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,319
um to find out which one you have to

162
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,579
find the best management practice and

163
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,319
one of the other things that was

164
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,478
interesting

165
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,100
um and I've mentioned this before is

166
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,538
that we always think about fusarium

167
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,819
being a root board disease and being

168
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:32,759
systemic inside of the plant

169
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,680
um there is a foliar or aerial fusarium

170
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,439
and they've actually been recovering

171
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,220
fusarium from flower buds

172
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:44,879
um on cannabis plants and

173
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,940
one of the other interesting things that

174
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:51,899
um they've been observing and this comes

175
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:54,478
down to propagation is that root bound

176
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,060
plants which I see a lot of root bound

177
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,978
cannabis plants tend to have more

178
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,079
fusarium issues that having those

179
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:04,199
spiraled roots that girdle in on

180
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,839
themselves are not good and you need to

181
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,300
make sure you have really well

182
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,000
um developed but also you know branching

183
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,300
root systems and not spiraling to help

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,538
prevent a few serium issues

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,978
um in your plants and it was interesting

186
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,500
when they were talking about that like

187
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,719
all the researchers were like yeah yeah

188
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,418
especially when they talked about uh the

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,400
the spiraling girdling roots in pots and

190
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:30,839
how important that is for them not to

191
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,239
have that because what I often see is

192
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,279
people hold plants too long in either a

193
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,019
four inch or one gallon and then the

194
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,478
roots go around the edge of the pot and

195
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,219
then they just pot them up and then it

196
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,538
doesn't grow out of that circular root

197
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,580
ball shape

198
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,439
um and it just the roots get Tighter and

199
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,379
Tighter in on themselves

200
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,779
um if you're not familiar with you know

201
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,279
how to untangle your roots and kind of

202
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,839
flange them out make sure you do some

203
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,399
reading on doing that and better yet

204
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,258
don't let them get root Bound in the

205
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,598
smaller containers

206
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,379
um yeah let's let's touch on that for a

207
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:02,339
second

208
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,860
um so

209
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,500
on Instagram I see people posting photos

210
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,879
of their bragging about their roots and

211
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,620
in a lot of you know whether it's a

212
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,300
mycorrhizal company or something like

213
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,720
that and a lot of times in those photos

214
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,160
like you said the roots will be wrapping

215
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,840
around themselves so essentially you can

216
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,720
remove the pot and you'll still see the

217
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,818
shape of the container just out of made

218
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,099
up of root mass and

219
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,979
um well that's a good root biomass

220
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,959
that's not optimal for plant health and

221
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,538
and like you said so what you need to do

222
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,838
is transplant sooner or if you're using

223
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:39,658
fabric pots or the fertile pots those

224
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,240
types of pots that helps prevent this

225
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:45,059
root girdling and uh you want white

226
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,620
bright white roots not the brown or

227
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,778
mushy looking roots that typically a

228
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,399
sign of fruit disease so I just wanted

229
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,100
to touch on those points why since you

230
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,139
brought up root health and yeah people

231
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,019
do need to transplant sooner a lot of

232
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,659
times I like to transplant a

233
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,179
I guess my biggest visual clue since

234
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:06,000
this is a podcast would be when the

235
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:08,939
roots are visible through the soil or

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,899
the media and have enough structure to

237
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,660
hold

238
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,100
the the shape of the

239
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,399
of the container that they were coming

240
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,879
out of but yet are not seen visibly

241
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,159
starting to turn and wrap around

242
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,559
that container does that make sense yes

243
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,299
100 and I would I would agree with that

244
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,518
statement

245
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,539
yeah I mean it's easy to check too so

246
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,639
that's the thing people need to be

247
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,439
checking their plants to see what stage

248
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,120
of root growth they're at in transplant

249
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,339
accordingly yeah you actually the

250
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,259
probably where I see this the most is in

251
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:44,700
the tree industry

252
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:49,019
um and people go by you know uh canned

253
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,339
in pots trees and and then they just go

254
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,440
pop them out of the pot and stick them

255
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,660
in the ground and the trees as the tree

256
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,160
grows it literally chokes itself to

257
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,019
death so it might not die in the first

258
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,539
few years but later on in life it will

259
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,060
choke itself to death and

260
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,679
um I've been in enough like forensic

261
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,838
dead tree talks and they'll show how

262
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,359
they'll pop these trees up and the tree

263
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,760
just girdled itself to death because it

264
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,500
was the roots were girdled or with trees

265
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,299
also planting too deep is one of the

266
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,519
biggest tree Killers

267
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:20,099
um people plant them too deep and pile

268
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,320
up soil around the top of the tree and

269
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,480
that can be fatal there's a famous study

270
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,519
where they looked at how many trees

271
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,139
coming out of Nursery production and

272
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,060
then planted in yards are planted too

273
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,799
deep so I mean roots

274
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,958
planting them correctly not having

275
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,899
girdled roots not planting too deep is

276
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,159
all really important now I will you know

277
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,778
have to say that certain plants

278
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,338
especially like tomatoes you can plant

279
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,320
deep because they throw advantageous

280
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,500
Roots cannabis can throw adventitious

281
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,480
Roots too but you know know your plant

282
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,519
no girdled roots and know how deep to

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,259
plant it

284
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,360
yeah and if you do get root girdling

285
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,860
like that you actually want to go

286
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,220
through and score the roots so I'll take

287
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,399
a knife or a sharp tool and and go and

288
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,800
go down at least four or five times

289
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,720
around a circular pot as a way of

290
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,578
loosening those roots up and and

291
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,379
spreading them out so it's not the end

292
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:12,059
of the world if it does happen but if

293
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,620
you don't want to plant that plant as is

294
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,018
you actually need to

295
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,940
break up the roots I guess yeah we're

296
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,860
more aggressive than people realize with

297
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,720
it the plants can handle it yeah you

298
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,980
know we will tend to because you know we

299
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,600
have seven acres here and we've been

300
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,399
planting lots of trees here we'll tend

301
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,740
to take the roots and just like pull

302
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,019
them out and then plant them with the

303
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,579
roots then kind of out in the hole to

304
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,240
spread them

305
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:38,399
um that said if you do cut your roots or

306
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,879
root prune them before planting make

307
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,220
sure your tool is clean and then also

308
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,100
you know anytime you wound there is a

309
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,620
chance of pathogens can get in

310
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,420
um and you know good old fusarium

311
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,259
um you know interesting

312
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,759
um uh zamir has not only looking at what

313
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,860
diseases they have he's also been

314
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,559
trialing

315
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,560
um some products as far as prevention

316
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,179
and like with the fuserium they found

317
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,078
that

318
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,958
um

319
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,599
uh root Shield did really well in their

320
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,599
trials and that's trichoderma they also

321
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,180
did pre-stop uh pre-stop is a newer

322
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,360
product from lollymond and then also

323
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:23,278
asparillo which is coming from biobest

324
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,039
all three of those products formed well

325
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,600
as a preventative

326
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,919
um to getting a few serum and it's not

327
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,060
going to fix it

328
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,740
um and that's why for me I've always

329
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,838
been really big about trichoderma

330
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,120
applications early on because

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,160
trichoderma will actually eat fuserium

332
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,480
and protect your roots and prevent you

333
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,759
from getting the problem because once

334
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,800
you get few cerium it's very very

335
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,240
difficult to manage so prevention is key

336
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,699
here so they are finding in their

337
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,339
cannabis trials on fusarium that again

338
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,959
root shield pre-stop and esparillo have

339
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,660
been doing a very good preventative job

340
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:57,179
of preventing the plants from getting

341
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:59,039
the pathogens

342
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:02,219
did they talk about environmental

343
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:06,899
conditions or seasonality affecting

344
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,420
um prevalence of fusarium no because he

345
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,000
his his stuff that he's doing is

346
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,699
controlled in indoor environment so it's

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,639
not as seasonal as it would be outside

348
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,320
in outdoor production

349
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,120
okay

350
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,060
because it's it's it's summer year round

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,679
inside of a greenhouse

352
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,059
sure but we still see it showing up

353
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,219
obviously in greenhouses and

354
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:30,838
environments um and you know things like

355
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,060
even though cannabis doesn't get it like

356
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,920
downy mildew you don't get that to later

357
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:38,039
see season because on the East Coast

358
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,078
that's got to blow up on the the jet

359
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,019
stream and so you can see seasonality

360
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,599
disease because the environment's moving

361
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,060
um the disease around

362
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,420
um but no he didn't go into that too

363
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:54,838
much and at all on the environment

364
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:56,278
um as far as that is crazy to me too I

365
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,399
remember hearing that at a talk about

366
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:02,939
how these spores actually go up

367
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,019
into the atmosphere like quite high in

368
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,420
the environment like you mentioned the

369
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,940
jet stream I I had no idea that the

370
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:11,338
spores could travel as far or as high as

371
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,440
they they do or the researchers found

372
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,240
yeah yeah no there's some crazy stuff

373
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
where they're actually you know the

374
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,980
going up there and then looking for what

375
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,839
they can find up in I don't know if the

376
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,579
right words the atmosphere

377
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,180
um

378
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,319
and

379
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,838
um

380
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,639
and look and they're finding pathogens

381
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,220
up there

382
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,680
um and that's why yeah you know with

383
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,060
hurricanes you know I grew up in Florida

384
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,419
um and work a lot in the Florida

385
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:43,018
industry too and why we see

386
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:45,539
um bad disease issues after hurricanes

387
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,278
and I kind of thought it was because oh

388
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:50,219
there's so much rain but they think now

389
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,559
part of it is is just the giant wind

390
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,560
blender of moving all the pathogens

391
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,698
around and then dumping the pathogens

392
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,138
um so there's some interesting work

393
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:00,139
being looked at with that stuff

394
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:05,458
so cool what uh what other research did

395
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,519
you find

396
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,319
um was presented at the conference that

397
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,698
well you thought would be relevant to

398
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,680
cannabis I think one of the biggest

399
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:16,078
focuses that zamir has been working on

400
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,819
is hopsulate and viroid which is you

401
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,259
know a very I don't know if it's a

402
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,620
sensitive touching I don't know what the

403
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:25,078
description is but it's it's a

404
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:28,078
it's it's it's an issue

405
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,458
um and for a while I wasn't sure I was

406
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,379
convinced how much of an issue it was

407
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,659
only because again I don't run in this

408
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:36,240
Arena again I run with six and eight

409
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,458
legged things but

410
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,159
um they had done

411
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,859
or they have been doing

412
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,838
um up in Canada some really extensive

413
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:51,060
testing and

414
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:54,000
um in 2020 through 2022

415
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,338
um they started testing

416
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,198
um cannabis plants

417
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,660
um for

418
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,419
um different diseases

419
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:06,379
um mostly virus stuff well virus and hop

420
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:09,539
sleep and viroid which is not a virus

421
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:11,399
and looking at the different things and

422
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,198
they did find

423
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,519
um through their

424
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:21,299
serving out there in Canada they tested

425
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:24,959
uh 1700 over 1700 cannabis plants in

426
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:27,000
Canada and they found that about 19 of

427
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,359
those plants tested positive or hops

428
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,500
latent viroid that's almost 20 percent

429
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,060
of the plants tested positive

430
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,799
most people

431
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,179
um don't know they have it and I would

432
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:43,139
say until it's too late but since

433
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:44,159
there's no way of curing or fixing it

434
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,259
um

435
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,360
you know it's it's too late it's just

436
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,039
too late just having it is too late but

437
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,079
they start seeing you know the smaller

438
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,419
plants the smaller flowers but one of

439
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,099
the biggest take-home things for me was

440
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,599
the imagery

441
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,620
um that they had

442
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,259
um of the trichomes and how the

443
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,419
trichomes were significantly smaller you

444
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:09,539
still have the same number of trichomes

445
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,699
but you have smaller like these deflated

446
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:15,720
it's almost like a deflated balloon of a

447
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:18,500
trichome head and leads to less THC and

448
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,279
less uh CBD

449
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,980
so

450
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,078
um it can be pretty devastating uh to

451
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,120
the crop

452
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,279
one thing that was this was one of the

453
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,879
very interesting things for me

454
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,678
um

455
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,419
and again don't come back to me and ask

456
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,220
questions because I'm not a plant

457
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,080
pathologist

458
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,000
um and zamir has put out some really

459
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,319
good papers and he's done some really

460
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,599
good

461
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,759
um YouTube videos

462
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,038
um out there but one of the things they

463
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,019
started looking at was if they're

464
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,579
testing plants and people like yeah test

465
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:52,859
my plants they test negative and then

466
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:54,599
they you know sell off clones or move

467
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:57,240
them to other facilities why is it

468
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,500
spreading so much well what they started

469
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,460
looking at is they were tests they

470
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:06,179
tested the roots the stems and

471
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:10,380
um the leaves of the plants and what was

472
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,980
super interesting is that

473
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,120
um

474
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,339
on on the testing they found that and he

475
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,719
had this really great chart

476
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,220
um which I talked to him about

477
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,720
recreating this chart for an online

478
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,960
infograph and I need to talk to him

479
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,900
about getting that done but basically if

480
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,298
they tested a leaf you could have a

481
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,340
negative result if you tested a stem you

482
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,200
could have a negative result if you

483
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:37,259
tested that same plant and you tested

484
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,519
the roots you can test positive

485
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:43,200
but

486
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:44,720
if the Leafs test positive the roots are

487
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,660
always positive

488
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,819
so if you really want to know if you

489
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,538
have it or not you have to test the

490
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:56,759
roots because again if the the roots are

491
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:59,700
the the

492
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,859
the the the the the one consistently

493
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,019
positive thing in a way because again

494
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:06,000
you can have negative leaves and

495
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,700
negative Roots but you can't have

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,558
positive leaves and negative Roots if

497
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,880
the foliage is positive and the stems

498
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,918
are positive the roots are going to be

499
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,020
positive but you can have positive roots

500
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,940
and negative stems and foliage so just

501
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,500
testing the foliage is not enough and I

502
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,360
think possibly this is what's happened

503
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,700
is because we're also trained for

504
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,500
testing the Foliage for viruses you know

505
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,819
I wasn't ever taught to test roots for

506
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,380
viruses

507
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:29,879
but then when people started talking

508
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,280
about it more they're like well yeah

509
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,559
certain viruses move to the root systems

510
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,178
and they hang out there

511
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,359
um and then later on they express

512
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,340
themselves thus latent viroid and so

513
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,319
they think this is part of what's

514
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,459
happening is people test their plans and

515
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,500
in good faith they think they're

516
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,360
negative but they're actually positive

517
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,359
because it's it's positive in the root

518
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,579
system and so I think this is kind of

519
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,439
what's created some problems confusions

520
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,599
and you know you think you have clean

521
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,000
plans but then you end up with the

522
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,058
viroid and how did you get it and

523
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,480
there's been lots of speculation on how

524
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:08,879
it is being transmitted out there so

525
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,240
that was a super interesting thing

526
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,039
um for me to realize that you can't just

527
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,400
be testing foliage that you need to be

528
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:19,980
testing root systems but be cautious

529
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,500
because you can't test like roots with

530
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,440
soil because the soil can mess up test

531
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,179
results you have to

532
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,160
um you know talk with your testing

533
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,840
company on the procedure and protocol

534
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,340
and um when I was at MJ bizcon last week

535
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,220
with you

536
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:40,500
um I did talk to some of the the testing

537
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,538
companies and

538
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,419
um I'm waiting for some answers on

539
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,220
protocol for testing Roots because the

540
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,799
people at the show didn't have a clear

541
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,839
answer because again you have to be able

542
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,519
to remove all the soil but you can't add

543
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,939
anything that could possibly mess your

544
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,940
test up

545
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,918
yeah I've been talking to uh Three

546
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,720
Rivers biotech about this and I'm just

547
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,419
going back here to my notes they did

548
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,720
some research where they also found

549
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,640
um similar results where uh they had 14

550
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,919
positive root samples only seven of

551
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,280
those were positive on Leaf samples out

552
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,500
of uh 35 cultivars it looks like they do

553
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,819
have the ability to test Roots

554
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,038
um because I'd ask them this after

555
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,019
talking to you last I need to confirm

556
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,798
that because we've been working with

557
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:30,079
them to offer buffer testing for top

558
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,819
slate and thyroid

559
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,439
and I know one of the recommendations

560
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,599
was you test the plant then test it

561
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,759
again a few weeks later

562
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,099
and that's another way of of kind of

563
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,679
getting to that

564
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,139
positive answer or negative or more

565
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,360
confirmed negative

566
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:51,600
zamir says three tests three tests

567
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:54,298
before you can say a plant does not have

568
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,500
it the problem is is you test it you

569
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:57,538
think it's negative and it's sitting

570
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,819
there and it's possibly positive and

571
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:02,400
then you get into the this the spread

572
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,279
and this is stuff that zamir has been

573
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,780
looking at where they're looking

574
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,119
um at the movement like they he had

575
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,519
these maps of greenhouses and showing

576
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,459
which plants are positive and you could

577
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,619
see you know hot zones and the question

578
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,419
is has it been spread I know it's been

579
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,399
thrown out there about rude aphids

580
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,320
vectoring it pretty much all the

581
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,298
research people have you know said

582
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,519
that's not likely

583
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,259
um I I had been corresponding with Dr

584
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,960
Susan Halbert

585
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:33,859
um she's one of the top aphid experts

586
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,779
um in probably North America

587
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:38,519
and you know the general consensus is

588
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,918
most likely not

589
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,379
um you know there's enough mechanical of

590
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,120
people with pruners and touching plants

591
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,580
and this and that

592
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,899
um and one of the areas they're just

593
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,339
starting to look at is it could be

594
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,259
waterborne

595
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,658
um again not my wheelhouse we're gonna

596
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:58,558
have to wait until more research comes

597
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,179
out about this and again I know that um

598
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,460
in the hemp side of things here in the

599
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,620
United States like Purdue's looking at

600
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,600
all this stuff you see Riverside and up

601
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,298
in Canada Simon Fraser universities

602
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,918
who's uh doing a lot of This research on

603
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,679
this stuff so there's not clear answers

604
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,020
yet and you know again

605
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,900
uh this is so you don't think it's past

606
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,879
it's spread by pests at this time it's

607
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,620
not it's not a likely Vector when you

608
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,320
say waterborne though are you talking

609
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:26,579
about splashing from when people are

610
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,500
mechanically watering or you're talking

611
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,359
about like transpiration

612
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,640
like through water Movement Like through

613
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,558
sub irrigation sharing like ebb and

614
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,240
flood benches things like that I wonder

615
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:41,940
if that's okay part of well yeah for me

616
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,940
I think the bigger implication is for

617
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,360
those of us that reuse the media if that

618
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,179
soil has had a plant that had a you know

619
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,619
a positive test for a virus um

620
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,380
I don't know if we have ways of

621
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,178
remediating that at this point in time

622
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,220
yo though I have Growers with you know

623
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,259
currently doing quite well that have

624
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,079
tested positive for the virus and are

625
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,359
reusing their media in those beds um

626
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,339
they just have to really manage

627
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:11,219
the plants and keep them really healthy

628
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:13,259
and then they don't see a lot of effect

629
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,419
from the virus I guess but if they if

630
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,038
they miss it and the plants are not as

631
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:19,679
healthy as they should be then it seems

632
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,658
like they just really crash much harder

633
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,600
than a non-infected plant would well

634
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,880
just like people you know if you're run

635
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:30,538
down you're not eating well you're

636
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,900
having Coke for breakfast every day

637
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:35,400
you know yeah I just you're I just want

638
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,538
to be careful with our human analogies

639
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,759
because I feel like some people take

640
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:40,558
them too far I I agree in this case I

641
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,359
think it applies but in other cases I

642
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,579
think people start making comparisons

643
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:46,798
that don't necessarily fit I agree I

644
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:49,740
agree but we all know anything if you're

645
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,480
healthier you're less likely

646
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,339
have issues I mean that's that's a

647
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,079
wonderful thing

648
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,859
and that

649
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,859
um

650
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,779
with having healthy plants I mean you

651
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:02,939
can and just like rude aphids I mean

652
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,798
I've seen people with rude aphids and

653
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,960
bad ones but they have a healthy looking

654
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,538
crop um because the plants are healthy

655
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,980
enough to get through it uh and and I

656
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,140
agree with you that's one of the things

657
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,140
that scares me about reasoning soil is

658
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,580
you know chopping the plants off and

659
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,059
then planting right next to it you're

660
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,038
not removing the the roots that can have

661
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,099
pathogens in them

662
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,500
um also when people chop the foliage and

663
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:30,899
put it on the soil surface because you

664
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,558
can just be recycling pathogens and

665
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,538
pests right back into your system and I

666
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,480
I know the the the that we've got enough

667
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:42,480
healthy things to fight it well you hope

668
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,640
you do you do until you don't

669
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,919
um and from an environmental standpoint

670
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,360
I understand

671
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,259
you know

672
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,538
reusing the soil because that's you know

673
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,179
much more eco-friendly to do but at the

674
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:58,619
same time you have to know your crop and

675
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,419
you have to know your risk to know if

676
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,939
that's right for what you're doing and

677
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,400
also depends on on the size of your your

678
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,620
production because if you've got you

679
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,298
know some of my Growers on ornamentals

680
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:11,639
you know there are hundreds of acres and

681
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:13,319
trying to micromanage all those crops

682
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,820
you know it's just it's it's too

683
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,500
difficult if you have a smaller Growing

684
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,939
System often like you do in cannabis you

685
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,940
can micromanage the crops better

686
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,120
well it's different too when the plants

687
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,038
leaving the facility as a living plant

688
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,918
consistently like you see with your

689
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:31,079
ornamental side you brought up this

690
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,080
concept though of healthy plants being

691
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,359
more resistant and that kind of in my

692
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,879
head led me to the bricks discussion

693
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,439
that you see and I just feel like we

694
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,200
should at least talk about it because I

695
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,298
still see it out there quite a bit um

696
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,038
can you just explain to me because I've

697
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:52,259
mentioned this to people that there is

698
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:54,359
research out there that shows that

699
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:57,538
um and uh correct me if I misstate this

700
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:59,399
but that it doesn't really matter how

701
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:01,440
healthy your plant is if there's insect

702
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,720
pressure that is sufficient

703
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,580
you will still the insects will still

704
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,460
eat the plant more or less right and

705
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:11,519
sugars did not equate healthy

706
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,019
okay I mean if

707
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,000
I mean just take us through it I guess

708
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,220
so

709
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,759
um there is this should I say urban

710
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,620
legend and you know the people that make

711
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,079
these claims

712
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:28,339
say they have data but they won't show

713
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:31,980
you any data or any research

714
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:34,019
but as of yet the research that has been

715
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,980
looked at that

716
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:39,778
pretty much disproves it just because

717
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,419
you have high bricks does not mean you

718
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:44,159
have pests and I see this in almost

719
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,020
every talk I give

720
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,299
if you walk out your back door and

721
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:51,918
you're in like virgin forest in the

722
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:54,418
middle of Montana or you know Wyoming

723
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,659
every plant you're looking at there is

724
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,940
getting eaten by insects because plants

725
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,520
are designed to be eaten by insects

726
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,320
that's what they do it's an ecology you

727
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,480
know you look at oak trees caterpillars

728
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,460
eat the leaves that's why trees have so

729
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,079
many leaves the caterpillars poop on the

730
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,778
ground it makes the fertilizer for the

731
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,339
tree it's not a bad thing plants being

732
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:16,558
eaten but when we have these

733
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:20,759
monocultures and what perfect plants

734
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:22,619
this is when you know this human

735
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,220
you know we're trying to create a crop

736
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:29,099
for humans and we have zero tolerance

737
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:32,278
really for insects even though plants

738
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:34,079
can still perform well even if there's

739
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,900
feeding damage on them

740
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,839
sugars really I mean you think about it

741
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:43,080
if if insects didn't like to feed

742
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,538
on sugary plants why do things eat

743
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,759
apples why do things eat grapes why do

744
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:50,759
things eat blueberries I mean those

745
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,879
fruits are all super high in sugars and

746
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,798
you know you look at drosophila Suzuki

747
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,299
eye I'm trying to remember the common

748
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:01,139
name right now

749
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:03,240
it's it's a huge pest in berries where

750
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,360
this uh drosoft it's a fruit fly comes

751
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,099
in lays its egg inside of blueberries

752
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,879
raspberries all these different berries

753
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:14,219
and then the maggot eats uh the fruit

754
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,740
and that's high sugar so how is high

755
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,419
sugar stopping that it's not and that's

756
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,880
the crazy thing to me I I just don't

757
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:23,880
know the whole idea of the bricks and

758
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,740
the in fact I I do have over in my

759
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,940
drawer right next to me I have a bricks

760
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,099
meter that's more testing sugars for uh

761
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,259
uh for understanding for grapes for

762
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,599
knowing the sugar content for you know

763
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:40,079
food consumption

764
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,398
um and this whole idea of just pumping

765
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,460
your bricks and you won't have pest

766
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:47,000
issues there's just no evidence of it

767
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,000
out there

768
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:54,360
so could we could we say though that if

769
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:57,538
you had two cannabis plants and one had

770
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,219
a higher Brix level it may in theory be

771
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:01,099
a healthier plant if it's the same

772
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,659
cultivar

773
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:05,759
being healthy

774
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,159
I mean that's the correlation that a lot

775
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,859
of Growers or Association that a lot of

776
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,120
Growers have been making is supposedly

777
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:14,519
it's going to be healthier and if you

778
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,019
hit a certain bricks number on that for

779
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,519
that particular crop and it's going to

780
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,778
be a different number for blueberries

781
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:24,778
apples cannabis then you will not see

782
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:26,759
pest pressure on that plant

783
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:29,278
um that's I mean that's the argument

784
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,558
that's that's being presented where's

785
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,880
where's but from an entomologist you're

786
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:34,918
saying that you just haven't seen any

787
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,760
research to support this well there's

788
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,179
not

789
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,640
supports it um we've seen

790
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,159
there's like one paper that was kind of

791
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,140
inconclusive but pretty much the

792
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,419
research that has been done in the past

793
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,100
disproves this claim

794
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,380
um and again the people that are

795
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:55,319
currently making these claims

796
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,960
they'll just say they say they have data

797
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,939
but they've never publicly released it

798
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,440
they've never published a paper on it

799
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,720
they've never written a scientific

800
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,340
journal article nothing it's like we've

801
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,720
got this big secret but we're not going

802
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:08,398
to tell you how we did anything just

803
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,179
trust us even though we're not going to

804
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,038
tell you anything and okay so if anyone

805
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,840
has data on this and is listening send

806
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,658
it to Suzanne

807
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,000
and uh we'll we'll do a whole podcast on

808
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:23,899
bricks if uh if someone can prove it to

809
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,898
be effective so

810
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,240
um one one other note though when we're

811
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,058
talking about this though there there is

812
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,859
like you mentioned this human analogy

813
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:36,599
there is it is the same with plants if

814
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,579
you have a healthier plant it's going to

815
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,879
be more resistant

816
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:43,259
to past pests tend to go to the stressed

817
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,640
out plant

818
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:46,619
um in your room right I mean that's

819
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,080
fairly

820
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:52,139
is is that safe to say you're kind of

821
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,259
making a face like yes but at the same

822
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,259
time

823
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,298
you know I I also think part of our

824
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:07,139
problem is is the the fact we're dealing

825
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:09,898
with so many invasives that that kind of

826
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:12,419
throws everything out the window because

827
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:15,719
you look at the United States and ash

828
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:17,880
trees and they're they're basically all

829
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,460
gone because of emerald ash borer and

830
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,620
you cannot tell me these millions of

831
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,240
trees that have been killed were

832
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:26,038
unhealthy

833
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,140
um it's because we had an invasive come

834
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:29,579
in emerald ash borer and wipe out all

835
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,140
the trees

836
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:34,139
um and those trees have been living

837
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,480
healthily for you know hundreds of years

838
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,820
um in the forests here so I think that's

839
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,319
nothing I mean yes plant health and

840
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:46,259
not going overboard with plant health

841
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,439
because there's this fine line of

842
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,359
you know NPK and other nutrients and

843
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,580
plants but you know

844
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,699
giving them too much love too much

845
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:57,778
nitrogen can definitely create pest

846
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,159
issues

847
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:01,200
um we know that for sure there's been

848
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,840
really good research out of like Texas A

849
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,640
M looking specific specifically at

850
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,439
nitrogen levels in correlation to

851
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,740
Western Flower thrips and two-spotted

852
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,140
spider mites showing that pushing your

853
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,419
plant with too much nitrogen creates

854
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,299
past problems so there's this happy

855
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,278
medium of not overfeeding not under

856
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:25,379
feeding being right in the million

857
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,339
middle that makes it less attractive or

858
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,778
because there's a difference between

859
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:33,119
plants pests being attracted to it or

860
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:35,278
pests having a higher reproductive rate

861
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,259
on the plant because of its nutritional

862
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,298
content those are two completely

863
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:42,058
different things

864
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:43,558
um you you look at

865
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:46,918
um I think one of probably the most

866
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:49,019
famous case of that is

867
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,940
um actually a medical oprid which I know

868
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,220
legal cannabis curve is going to use

869
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,380
it's one of the neonics

870
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,000
um it's been used for decades it's it's

871
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,919
kind of at the center of the B

872
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,440
controversy but one of the things we

873
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,899
know about that is if you treat a plant

874
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,480
with that and then you put two spots

875
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:08,460
spider mite on it those spider mites

876
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,039
females actually live longer and have

877
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,960
more babies because a metacloper without

878
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,940
going too deep basically acts as a plant

879
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,000
growth stimulant making the plant more

880
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,800
nutritious for spider mites so in that

881
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,659
situation

882
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,519
you know you can have a healthy plant

883
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:27,858
and just by putting a pesticide on it

884
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,858
you can create a spider mite problem

885
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,320
I hadn't heard that that's really

886
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,898
interesting it's super interesting

887
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,720
because initially

888
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:39,719
um the research

889
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,398
um they thought what was happening in

890
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,378
the landscape was a metaclobin was

891
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:45,779
killing off the beneficials and that's

892
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:47,519
why the spider mites were exploding but

893
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,619
one of the guys involved with it might

894
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,500
grew up at the University of Maryland he

895
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:55,200
is an amazing uh landscape research

896
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,358
entomologist uh he and his wife are

897
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,399
Paula shoes bear like a Powerhouse of of

898
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,900
nerdum I love them to death they're

899
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,119
great people

900
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,820
um but Mike got involved and he helped

901
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,980
figure out that no it's not that it's

902
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,480
killing off the beneficials and and they

903
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,219
actually I've seen

904
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,420
images where plants treated with

905
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:15,419
metacloper the leaves are actually

906
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,539
bigger than non-treated plants in a

907
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,119
controlled study because again it's it's

908
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:22,440
acting as a plant growth stimulant so

909
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,200
there's I mean there's so many things

910
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,059
going on that we and we want a simple

911
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,618
answer and we want to simplify

912
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:30,480
everything

913
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,220
um and you can't because no matter what

914
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,240
you do there's going to be a consequence

915
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:39,439
to what you do but what we try to do is

916
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:43,139
have minimal impact reduce our pest risk

917
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,240
and you know follow science as as what

918
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:48,980
we know and at the same time try to be

919
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:48,979
environmental I mean that's my goal

920
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:56,460
yeah so that made me lead back to the

921
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:58,440
the bricks thing maybe that's a

922
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,179
simplified explanation but maybe there's

923
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,099
something that some that people are

924
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:05,519
doing in their ways of supposedly

925
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,740
attaining higher sugar levels that may

926
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,119
increase pest resistance that we a

927
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:12,559
mechanism we haven't identity but then

928
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,559
they they should be able to see that

929
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,859
yes that would that you would think it

930
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,239
would be reflected in the in the

931
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:21,539
research unless those researchers are

932
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:24,479
not replicating what you know people are

933
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:27,980
claiming in the field but

934
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,980
so many so many

935
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:38,159
people that you know everybody thought

936
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:39,838
and it makes sense that you know you

937
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,338
apply a pesticide that's going to kill

938
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,320
off the beneficials and you have more

939
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:45,239
pest issues you know we see that quite a

940
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,280
bit with especially like bifenthrin and

941
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,459
things like that so that's where

942
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,079
everybody just assumed that was the

943
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,240
result I mean that was why it was

944
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,339
happening but not till we really get in

945
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,719
there you know it really had nothing to

946
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:01,619
do with the beneficials in that

947
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:04,739
situation and I think people

948
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,780
jump to anecdotal conclusions without

949
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:08,459
having controls and without having

950
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,500
replications because if you're a

951
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,539
commercial production facility it's very

952
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:17,760
hard to have a a control where hey we're

953
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,559
just not gonna you know treat or do this

954
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,140
or we're going to treat in a different

955
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,820
way and then have replications because

956
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,460
your goal is to produce a product and

957
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,140
get it out the door not do research and

958
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,760
I think sometimes people jump to

959
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:31,139
conclusions

960
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,300
um which

961
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:36,059
I will say though

962
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,880
that these anecdotal observations that

963
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:41,519
Growers do see are very important

964
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,680
because that plants the seed for the

965
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,780
research and then we need to look at

966
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,519
that and be like okay is this what's

967
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,040
happening and that's where the whole

968
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,599
start of the bricks thing years ago

969
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:53,400
um because a lot of this bricks work is

970
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,260
really older work

971
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,139
um it's not something that was done the

972
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,420
last couple years probably decades ago

973
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,559
um that they did go out and and look at

974
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,800
these

975
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:07,078
um and you know

976
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,700
get the research from an anecdotal

977
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,680
observation so I'm not discounting

978
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:13,199
anybody's observations it's very

979
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,578
important to be observant start you know

980
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,799
thinking about well why is this

981
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,079
happening why are we seeing this why is

982
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,000
this plant doing this and try to figure

983
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,420
it out and then and this is kind of what

984
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,280
I do with my observations through the

985
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,320
industry as I travel everywhere I'm in

986
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,700
all kinds of production facilities and

987
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,400
then I'm like okay well we don't

988
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:34,379
understand this and then I'll go to my

989
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,200
research friends at the University who

990
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:41,579
they can do the controlled research and

991
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:44,098
help work with them to

992
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,180
um formulate the the trials that need to

993
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,640
be done

994
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:49,440
um I'm actually heading to Michigan next

995
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:51,659
week because I'm on an advisory

996
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,760
committee for

997
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:54,838
um High tunnel uh production and I'm

998
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,940
going to be working with several

999
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:59,219
universities on helping steer research

1000
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,220
from observations I've seen in the field

1001
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:04,919
of like what research we need to to do

1002
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:07,259
and so that's how this whole process

1003
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,740
kind of works and I think sometimes

1004
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,960
people make observations and they jump

1005
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:16,819
through the science they jump past the

1006
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,820
scientific method and make a claim

1007
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,059
so they go straight from hypothesis to

1008
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,400
conclusion without

1009
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:25,320
running a controlled trial and I you do

1010
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,539
see that and I think it's really hard

1011
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,059
not to when you're

1012
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,858
in a in a facility or in a functional

1013
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:33,539
grow room because like you said if you

1014
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:35,759
see something and and you get a result

1015
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:38,039
that you like you want to repeat that

1016
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,359
result over and over again and just in

1017
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,159
your head make an assumption for what's

1018
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,900
actually going on and it may not be

1019
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,019
accurate so yeah that's a that's a good

1020
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,039
point but let's we got way off topic I

1021
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,019
didn't even mean to bring that all up

1022
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,119
you that's all you attack

1023
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,338
it was it was it was something on my

1024
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,559
mind when you brought up plant health so

1025
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:58,679
let's get back to it though what other

1026
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,960
uh what other research was shared at the

1027
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:03,000
conference well the other thing that

1028
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,800
took me by surprise again normally you

1029
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,679
know I'm when they're talking about

1030
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,720
disease stuff I'm off doodling and you

1031
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,179
know not paying attention

1032
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,739
um but again zamir stuff is just so

1033
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,440
interesting

1034
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:18,719
um because past the hopsulating viroid

1035
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,119
onto viruses

1036
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:27,480
um is the viruses they're finding which

1037
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,039
um tobacco mosaic virus which

1038
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,659
um I've known to have been in cannabis

1039
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,639
but I was actually kind of surprised

1040
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:35,759
that when I mentioned this to a group of

1041
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:38,159
cannabis Growers they didn't think that

1042
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,380
tobacco I mean that cannabis got tobacco

1043
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,358
mosaic virus

1044
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,280
um and

1045
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:46,319
I guess there's still a myth out there

1046
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,640
circulating that it doesn't really get

1047
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:53,880
it but again over sampling over like 2

1048
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:57,838
000 plants they found 53 samples with

1049
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,599
tobacco mosaic virus the thing that I

1050
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,000
was surprised about was I did not know

1051
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,039
that cannabis could get tobacco streak

1052
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,539
virus and they actually had 56 samples

1053
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,800
of tobacco streak virus which was

1054
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,619
um

1055
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,240
surprising to me because again I I

1056
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,039
honestly didn't know too much about

1057
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,719
tobacco's streak virus so you know

1058
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,279
immediately to the internet to go learn

1059
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,799
and read about it

1060
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,260
um at lower levels they did found a

1061
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,560
rabbit's mosaic virus

1062
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:31,680
um they found tomato bushy stunt virus

1063
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:34,199
um cucumber mosaic virus and very low

1064
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:37,559
low amounts of like um Alfalfa mosaic

1065
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:39,779
virus so overall looking at all their

1066
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,960
samples and everything

1067
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,940
um that it basically kind of came back

1068
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,280
to out of all their samples about seven

1069
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,220
percent of the plants they tested

1070
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,220
carried a virus not a viroid but a virus

1071
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,480
of some kind so the viruses are out

1072
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,939
there

1073
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,019
um and you know some of them can be test

1074
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,260
for

1075
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:03,960
um with a Lysa test kits that you know

1076
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,660
you can get from companies like idea

1077
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,179
um which you know most my ornamental and

1078
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,559
vegetable Growers keep those uh test

1079
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:12,118
kits in-house so they're always

1080
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,920
available in case they need to test

1081
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,500
right then

1082
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,358
um but it is something that can be

1083
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,239
causing some problems that you may be

1084
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:23,819
mistaking for nutritional or other

1085
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:28,739
issues so the viruses

1086
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:30,599
um are out there so just uh to to don't

1087
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,179
discount those

1088
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,200
um on there and just you know with zamir

1089
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:36,480
too

1090
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,858
um and I can I don't know if I send it

1091
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,780
to you not he actually put out a really

1092
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:42,000
good publication

1093
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,920
um with the disease stuff for cannabis

1094
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,260
if you don't have it I'll send you a

1095
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,000
link and then you can link it out or

1096
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,560
attach it however you do your internet

1097
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,199
magic

1098
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:55,679
um but um I highly recommend if you ever

1099
00:42:52,199 --> 00:43:00,838
have a chance to hear zamir speak he um

1100
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:02,279
he does an amazing uh job presenting

1101
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:03,059
okay I'll have to try and get him on the

1102
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,980
podcast

1103
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:06,000
I know somebody that knows him that

1104
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,920
could probably get him on the podcast

1105
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,199
for you

1106
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,240
I you are my main source of podcast

1107
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:14,460
guests thank you

1108
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:18,539
um that's really interesting I think the

1109
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:20,280
the tobacco mosais virus stuff sort of

1110
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:23,219
came from no one actually having an

1111
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,599
actual test it was all speculation

1112
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:26,338
um it was kind of like like you said

1113
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,900
that Growers making observations and

1114
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:29,460
then we finally got in a laboratory and

1115
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,680
now you've seen tests that actually show

1116
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,940
that it is showing up in cannabis

1117
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,679
because I for the longest time didn't

1118
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,900
think it was an actual

1119
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,000
cannabis disease because no one ever

1120
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,460
actually had a test to support their

1121
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,679
claim around it but

1122
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,599
um it makes me wonder when you say all

1123
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,118
the viruses I wonder how many times

1124
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,280
people have thrown out a

1125
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,200
potential promising cultivar because it

1126
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,619
underperformed and maybe it wasn't even

1127
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:58,318
the the cultivar it was the virus

1128
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:01,980
sometimes viruses can improve

1129
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,599
plants too so

1130
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,000
yeah yeah I just wonder how that's

1131
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,400
affected our yeah genetic choices by

1132
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,079
breeders and things like that so yeah

1133
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,160
it's interesting

1134
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,539
um

1135
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:14,338
yeah we might have to do a show on

1136
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:16,739
viruses now that we're talking about

1137
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:19,739
yeah I'm not doing that I've given you

1138
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,118
my my virus knowledge of limited again I

1139
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:23,699
mean this is really outside of my

1140
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,980
comfort zone because

1141
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,598
I like to stick with my bugs but I find

1142
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,300
it very interesting and obviously there

1143
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,800
is a correlation with things that do get

1144
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,800
vectored

1145
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,140
um by insects and things like that

1146
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,019
um because can you touch on those like

1147
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:41,759
what are the main diseases

1148
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:45,480
that you would see vectored by in

1149
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,420
cannabis by the virus West Coast only

1150
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,280
East Coast people you guys have died

1151
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,200
Dodge bullet

1152
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,300
West Coast guys if you're not familiar

1153
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:56,759
with beat top curly virus and it's

1154
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,660
Vector you

1155
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,280
um

1156
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:03,659
you really need to uh be aware of it

1157
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,140
um

1158
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:09,719
there was talk after talk after talk in

1159
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:14,159
fact some of them that talked about

1160
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:16,139
um how it has messed up their field

1161
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,879
trial research

1162
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:20,639
um one of my friends a researcher out in

1163
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,640
California she got it in her hemp trial

1164
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,500
plans and it's it's vectored by the beat

1165
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,159
Leaf Hopper

1166
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,800
um

1167
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:31,440
and it's all up and down the West Coast

1168
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,300
what I I think one of the more

1169
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,940
interesting things I found out about

1170
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,400
this is some of the researchers

1171
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:41,280
commented when they tried to rear the

1172
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,559
beat Leaf Hopper just on hemp they

1173
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,599
couldn't what it sounds like is

1174
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,739
happening because this is actually

1175
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,500
um

1176
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:53,639
a a an insect that feeds on multiple

1177
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:56,219
plants and it's picking up

1178
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:58,199
um the virus as it's feeding out in the

1179
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:00,000
environment it hops onto a hemp plant

1180
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:01,078
you know sticks its mouth part in

1181
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,119
because they have a piercing sucking

1182
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,318
mouth part feeds a bit transmits and

1183
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:10,019
like yeah no and then leaves the plant

1184
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:12,599
and now you're infected and so it's not

1185
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:14,338
like hemp is its primary hose it just

1186
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,980
kind of I don't want to say it's

1187
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:19,199
accidentally getting it but it's kind of

1188
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,539
just it's it's it's feeding and getting

1189
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,519
off and it and it's spreading it now in

1190
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,279
other crops how they manage this is they

1191
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,679
get rid of the weeds back to the problem

1192
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,660
with outdoor hemp there are no

1193
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,598
herbicides and you know if you're

1194
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:36,299
growing 20 plants sure you can hand weed

1195
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,300
when you're getting into 500 acres of

1196
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,240
hemp you're not hand weeding

1197
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,740
um and and now you've got the Weeds now

1198
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,078
you've got weeds taking over your plants

1199
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:49,679
and now you've got weeds that can have

1200
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,260
the virus and host your vector and it's

1201
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:55,379
just all downhill from there so it's

1202
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,660
it's a it's a multi-pronged issue but

1203
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,700
the the key to management

1204
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:02,639
seems to be

1205
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:05,639
um is uh you know managing the weeds in

1206
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:08,759
the area that have it on it

1207
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,199
so is there anything we can do for leaf

1208
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,720
Hoppers because I cannot stand those

1209
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:16,019
little buggers they drive me nuts

1210
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,639
um do we have any control options you

1211
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:18,780
mentioned weed removal but like in my

1212
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,719
home Garden

1213
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,599
they were a terror this last season

1214
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,818
well then I would get into which ones

1215
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:30,359
were they and what kind of damage were

1216
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:32,940
they actually doing kind of thing

1217
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:35,338
um I mean I hate to say

1218
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,119
natural pyrethrins

1219
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:39,719
um

1220
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,318
but you run the risk of

1221
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,559
um

1222
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:46,440
you know kind of disrupting any bio

1223
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:49,679
program you have out there uh this is

1224
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,838
where crop covers can also be used it's

1225
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,759
same methods we used for like flea

1226
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,920
Beetle management

1227
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,380
and where you put floating row covers

1228
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,059
over and things like that to to exclude

1229
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,119
them but

1230
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:04,679
as far as biological or softer products

1231
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,740
with the softer products it's going to

1232
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:09,000
be natural pyrethrins and soaps and they

1233
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:12,179
don't persist so you're going to have to

1234
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
be continually treating for them

1235
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:17,039
well they fly away so quickly too I mean

1236
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,199
to hit them with the adults challenging

1237
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,818
the adults because immatures don't have

1238
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,519
wings

1239
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:24,779
okay I guess I need to go back and even

1240
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,639
look what an immature looks like I

1241
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,200
always just noticed the adults yeah like

1242
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,420
I'll shake my sunflowers and they'll

1243
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:32,639
just it'll be like a cloud sometimes

1244
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,318
they're not causing any problems it it

1245
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,659
just

1246
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,400
are they a problem or not and and in the

1247
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:41,940
case

1248
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,858
um hemp for Western United States

1249
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:49,679
especially in the warmer areas

1250
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:52,078
um yes it's an issue but I mean I've got

1251
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,118
tons of leaf Hoppers here on my property

1252
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,980
I can go photograph them every day and

1253
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,660
they are of no economic importance to

1254
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,838
they don't do damage to any of my plants

1255
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:59,838
here

1256
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:07,460
anything else

1257
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:09,420
it's the only one you guys get hey

1258
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,980
we were just talking about ticks the

1259
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,380
other day on the phone so uh don't get

1260
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:16,858
me started on uh issues with the east

1261
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,579
coast and and disasters and disease so

1262
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:19,380
um

1263
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,060
getting back to it though are there any

1264
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,858
other

1265
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:25,318
before we move on from Leaf Hoppers do

1266
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:28,619
they Vector anything else besides that

1267
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,960
virus not that I know of at this time

1268
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:33,119
but again as time goes on and these

1269
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,740
researchers are doing more their surveys

1270
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,900
we'll find more but that's really the

1271
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:39,719
only one right now

1272
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:42,240
um I think that is you know

1273
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:44,219
of what I'd consider major economic

1274
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,879
importance

1275
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:50,879
okay so what about spider mites Rood

1276
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,760
aphids time brusset broad all broads all

1277
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,099
these other more common uh cannabis

1278
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,740
pests are those vectoring any pathogens

1279
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:00,859
or other diseases potentially well we

1280
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:00,858
know

1281
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,358
functor um

1282
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,039
and The larva feeds in the soil they

1283
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:09,179
pick up the pathogens in their gut and

1284
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:11,400
then when they're adults and they fly

1285
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:13,679
around and poop they deposit on Plants I

1286
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,660
mean that's well known well studied and

1287
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,399
that's why it's so important to manage

1288
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:20,519
your fungus gnats

1289
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,639
um but I don't know in cannabis of

1290
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:25,739
anything any of the mites are vectoring

1291
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:29,400
um you know white flies convector virus

1292
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:32,459
but so far nothing in hemp or cannabis

1293
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,920
um I think really that's you know most

1294
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,099
the other viruses are more mechanical in

1295
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,900
nature of of being vectored

1296
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,300
um so we're spreading it most likely

1297
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,940
with our clothes our scissors our hands

1298
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:48,780
yeah things like that our our watering

1299
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:51,179
all of those things okay can you talk

1300
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,800
again about you mentioned natural

1301
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:54,480
pyrethrins can you talk a little bit

1302
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,000
about pyrethrins the pros and cons

1303
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,179
around them because I still hear some

1304
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,260
some questions I I've chosen not to use

1305
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:03,078
them

1306
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,180
um in my garden

1307
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:08,640
but people get this idea that because a

1308
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:10,679
pesticide is natural in this case I

1309
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,980
think from the chrysanthemum or this

1310
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:14,519
idea of planting uh African

1311
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,858
chrysanthemums they'll get pest

1312
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:19,440
resistance can you just kind of talk a

1313
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:22,380
little bit about all of that okay so

1314
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,559
there's pyrethrins as you said and those

1315
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:28,079
are derived from a chrysanthemum and

1316
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,180
there's pyrethroids so you have to be

1317
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,519
very careful when you re read your

1318
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:34,019
labels pyrethrins are more expensive

1319
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:36,199
because they're a natural they're

1320
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,460
naturally extracted out of the plants

1321
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:40,799
pyrethroids are what has been

1322
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,480
synthesized in a lab it's a synthetic

1323
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,260
version of it where they can make it

1324
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,139
very inexpensively

1325
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:51,059
the pyrees roid the synthetic is much

1326
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:56,219
more stable

1327
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:58,800
when that is sprayed on a crop uh we

1328
00:51:56,219 --> 00:52:01,858
cannot reintroduce beneficials in there

1329
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,980
for typically two months because of the

1330
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:07,199
Persistence of that on the plant at

1331
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:10,380
least eight weeks is what we have to

1332
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:13,879
wait natural pyrethrins

1333
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:18,660
um that are you know in like pyganic

1334
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:21,420
those are not nearly as stable uh those

1335
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:23,879
tend to break down and this it can be

1336
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,159
very variable depending on overhead

1337
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,440
irrigation or drip irrigation are you in

1338
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,239
Maine are you in Florida you know UV

1339
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,119
heat there's a lot of variables but I

1340
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,799
like to at least wait a week maybe 10

1341
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,079
days but it can again depend on which

1342
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,180
beneficial you're using before you get

1343
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:40,099
back in

1344
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:42,899
um

1345
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:44,760
indoors under artificial lighting with

1346
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,318
no overhead irrigation they can persist

1347
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,059
much longer

1348
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,420
um than that

1349
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:53,220
um they are broad spectrum the problem

1350
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:56,700
is since they are one of our earlier

1351
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:58,379
pesticides pyrethrins and then again we

1352
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:00,838
developed the pyrethroids have been used

1353
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,900
so heavily there's a lot of resistance

1354
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:06,000
issues in the sense that they may not

1355
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,460
even work on your target pass because

1356
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,599
the pest has had so much exposure to

1357
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,400
them

1358
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,900
um that they possibly have developed

1359
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,358
resistance so it can be sometimes a

1360
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,039
little bit of a crap shoot whether the

1361
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,799
product's going to work or not also

1362
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:22,019
they're very non-selective

1363
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,359
um it's going to kill your beneficials

1364
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:26,280
just as much as pests if you know

1365
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:27,900
they're all susceptible and again it's

1366
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,220
it's not selective and this is what

1367
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,760
makes

1368
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:35,399
you know my job challenging because you

1369
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,440
know I want to be environmental I do I

1370
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,480
mean that's why I do my job is to reduce

1371
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,099
PES use but you know when we start

1372
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,260
looking at what I call some of these new

1373
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:45,599
designer pesticides

1374
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,660
um I think Sultan mitocide is a really

1375
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,460
good example from BASF again cannabis

1376
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,838
Growers can't use it but ornamental

1377
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,260
Growers can

1378
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:57,900
um strawberry vegetables though they can

1379
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,040
so here you have a strawberry plant and

1380
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,880
let's say you've got two spot spider

1381
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:07,679
mites you can come in and spray it with

1382
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,300
Sultan and it is only going to kill I

1383
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,219
think it's five or six spider mite

1384
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,140
species are on the label and that's it

1385
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:15,539
it doesn't do anything for broad mites

1386
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:17,578
it doesn't do anything for russets it

1387
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:18,838
doesn't do anything to any other insects

1388
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:21,359
or anything it doesn't hurt the

1389
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,880
Predators and it it's dialed in just for

1390
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,900
those handful of mites so we can spray

1391
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,660
that

1392
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,818
and then use our beneficials in

1393
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:31,440
conjunction with it flip to the flip

1394
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:33,659
side you know I'm going to be organic

1395
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,220
I'm going to be natural and you come in

1396
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:38,098
and so we're going to spray a natural

1397
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:40,618
pyrethrin like pyganic that's fine

1398
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:42,900
it kills everything it's blown out your

1399
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:44,720
beneficials it may or may not even kill

1400
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,400
your spider mites and actually

1401
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,558
pyrethrins pyrethroids are known for

1402
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,260
actually causing spider mite flares

1403
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:54,540
which is a whole nother discussion so

1404
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,119
you could actually make your your issue

1405
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:58,739
worth but you're being organic and in

1406
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,940
theory being better for the planet but

1407
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:02,399
now you're gonna have to retreat again

1408
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,880
and Retreat again so it's really hard

1409
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,818
sometimes because these new designer

1410
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,559
products are so targeted to just kill a

1411
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:13,079
few different insects and not be broad

1412
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,819
spectrum Killers where a lot of the more

1413
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,339
natural products

1414
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:19,980
are very broad spectrum in their nature

1415
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:21,799
in killing so it's it's a it's a tough

1416
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,420
you know

1417
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,000
walking this road sometimes on making

1418
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,280
recommendations for me

1419
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,559
um because with these new targeted

1420
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,480
products that again they're not going to

1421
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,160
be registered for cannabis stuff or

1422
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,019
approved for use in different states but

1423
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:39,659
for ornamentals and vegetables but we

1424
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:41,280
can just with pinpoint accuracy go in

1425
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:43,500
it's kind of to me like the difference

1426
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,000
of how you know we're doing targeted

1427
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,739
chemotherapy today where they can just

1428
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,119
put it in one spot where the old days

1429
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:49,799
you would inject it and get it

1430
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:51,300
throughout your entire body and have to

1431
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,880
deal with it

1432
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,920
um so it it's tough so I mean there can

1433
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,900
be a place where natural pyrethrins I

1434
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,780
think for home gardeners that just oh we

1435
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,460
have a little spot here we want to spray

1436
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:06,420
um and you know for cannabis because

1437
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,880
many states do allow it for use but

1438
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:10,559
their consequences to using it

1439
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,920
um the fact that it will blow out your

1440
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,839
beneficials it it can be iffy on its

1441
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,659
persistence indoors

1442
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:21,179
um and it can let definitely last longer

1443
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:24,420
indoors than out

1444
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:26,659
um and it's too broad spectrum for me in

1445
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,659
a way

1446
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,059
okay

1447
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,859
um any issues though

1448
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:34,260
so you mentioned this you know these

1449
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:34,858
more selective options that we have

1450
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,559
um

1451
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:39,179
which is which is great uh I don't know

1452
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,160
that I necessarily trust all these large

1453
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:44,098
AG companies to have my best interest

1454
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:46,558
from a health perspective in mind

1455
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:49,160
um as well and small and organic

1456
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,160
companies do

1457
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:54,420
no I mean we we've already seen that in

1458
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,858
the industry you know I always bring up

1459
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,358
Guardian might spray because it's such a

1460
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:58,980
great example

1461
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,779
um but there's been other companies out

1462
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,039
there too that have put out products but

1463
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,359
how do we

1464
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:07,199
you know are there any issues first of

1465
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:09,539
all with pyrethrins in terms of human

1466
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:13,139
toxicology or safety if we're going to

1467
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:15,179
be combusting and hailing eating

1468
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:16,920
our product like if I was going to use

1469
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:18,480
this on my vegetables or things like

1470
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,980
that

1471
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,300
um Let me let me ask you that question

1472
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,579
first and then I have a couple others

1473
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,800
okay well I'm not a medical doctor and I

1474
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:28,079
don't really study or understand I mean

1475
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,539
that's not my specialty

1476
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:33,780
um but the fact that it does break down

1477
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:36,659
in UV sunlight outside relatively

1478
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,880
quickly compared to other compounds

1479
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:40,980
um and it can be washed off plants it's

1480
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,140
not systemic

1481
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,460
um that that is something right there so

1482
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:45,779
if you're going to spray it on your

1483
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:48,420
strawberries since we're talking about

1484
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,460
strawberries you can just wash it off

1485
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,818
um if you're concerned about that also

1486
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:57,179
you know the label is the law and if you

1487
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:58,440
know you have your REI and this is

1488
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:00,719
what's really frustrating so if you're a

1489
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,639
commercial grower you have Reis and then

1490
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,919
you also have post Harvest intervals so

1491
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,358
REI is you can spray it and then how

1492
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,940
long before you can go back into that

1493
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,739
area to work for your safety and then

1494
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,159
post Harvest is okay you spray it and

1495
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:16,318
how long before you can Harvest your uh

1496
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:19,259
your goods none of that information is

1497
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,940
available on homeowner pesticides Only

1498
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,500
commercial pesticides even though

1499
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:25,200
oftentimes it's the same active

1500
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,599
ingredient so a homeowner doesn't have

1501
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,639
as much access or cannabis Growers that

1502
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,440
are buying homeowner products they don't

1503
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,900
have as much access to as much

1504
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,539
information on safety as commercial

1505
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:39,000
Growers do

1506
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:41,400
sure because the regulation is

1507
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,619
just not as strict and then the same

1508
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,700
thing around is it's 25 B right that's

1509
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:49,619
the 25 bees are the exempt from EPA

1510
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:52,199
registration

1511
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:54,119
yes because you will see company I mean

1512
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:55,318
we were both just at MJ bizcon for

1513
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:56,700
example you'll go to a Convention Show

1514
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:58,440
or you'll see you'll look online you'll

1515
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:01,439
see this product that claims that it's

1516
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,780
you know all safe ingredients are all

1517
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,760
natural and that basically just means

1518
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,780
it's most likely registering as a 25 B

1519
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,700
product

1520
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,980
where they don't fall under that EPA

1521
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:12,179
registration there's just some marketing

1522
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,798
terms around there that can make it

1523
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:15,358
confusing I think for Growers to really

1524
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:16,920
understand

1525
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:19,500
what's going on so can you talk a little

1526
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,500
about 25b and why you tend to gravitate

1527
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,219
away from those products look at them

1528
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,539
all

1529
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:26,399
don't get me wrong I will

1530
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:29,960
not product away from look at it because

1531
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,960
I'm still hoping

1532
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:38,159
some um potential but basically

1533
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:42,539
um the EPA decided that there is a group

1534
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:44,279
of food grade inputs basically that if

1535
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:46,259
you want to make a pesticide out of them

1536
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:50,579
you're not going to kill yourself in the

1537
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:52,980
process and so they are allowing you to

1538
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:54,960
companies to scoot around EPA

1539
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,240
registration

1540
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,159
um which EPA registration in the United

1541
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:00,838
States is about I think we're at like 10

1542
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:03,420
years to get a product to Market about

1543
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:06,179
10 million dollars because you've got to

1544
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:08,400
prove bee Safety Human safety you know

1545
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:10,019
all these different you know tests they

1546
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,559
have to do

1547
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:13,798
um

1548
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:16,079
where the 25b basically I mean if I

1549
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:19,259
wanted to I could go to my kitchen take

1550
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,019
my 25 b list which you know has you know

1551
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,359
like soybean oil I think corn oils on

1552
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:26,400
there uh rosemary oil and I can make

1553
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:28,739
that into a product and I can call it

1554
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,900
bug lady bug killer and then depending

1555
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:33,179
on the state like some states you go to

1556
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,500
they want you to register and basically

1557
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:36,058
that's just filling in a paperwork

1558
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,940
saying you're going to sell it here it's

1559
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:42,240
a super easy process and basically I can

1560
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:44,159
make any claims in theory that I want I

1561
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,919
can say it's safer beneficials only

1562
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:49,739
kills pests you know and all these

1563
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,420
different claims but the EPA doesn't

1564
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:53,399
care about efficacy they don't care

1565
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,659
about phytotoxicity they don't care

1566
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,700
about any of that stuff as long as

1567
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:58,440
you're not going to kill yourself or

1568
01:00:56,699 --> 01:01:00,118
totally destroy the environment they

1569
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,940
just kind of like go go do what you want

1570
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:06,539
and that's where there's been this whole

1571
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,480
crop a product spring up that don't have

1572
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:12,599
the level of testing

1573
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:14,960
that most pesticides do

1574
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:18,900
um which is

1575
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:21,240
you know challenging because people can

1576
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,579
say whatever they want basically and

1577
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:25,759
they're getting away with it for right

1578
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,760
now

1579
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:31,439
and you've done some tests with Growers

1580
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:32,939
actually on a few products and we won't

1581
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,099
obviously name the names of those

1582
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,539
products here but you found not only

1583
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:39,359
were a lot of these products more

1584
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:43,259
expensive but you've noticed

1585
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:44,940
the phytotoxicity issues not actual

1586
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,079
control I mean it might knock back a

1587
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,480
little bit some of the insect

1588
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,220
populations but you'd see a Resurgence I

1589
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,099
mean you've we've talked about this

1590
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:55,019
before off air yeah quite a bit yeah and

1591
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:56,640
I'm not throwing again all these

1592
01:01:55,019 --> 01:02:01,019
products out with the bath water in fact

1593
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:03,779
we're testing 225b products at one of my

1594
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:05,699
facilities ornamental facilities right

1595
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:07,920
now we're actually spraying them on full

1596
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:10,139
color poinsettias

1597
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,740
um because full color poinsettias are

1598
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:15,659
super super sensitive I mean that's kind

1599
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:19,558
of like you know the skin of a redhead

1600
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:21,659
it's the best way to put it and so we

1601
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,880
are testing them not only for

1602
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:26,279
phytotoxicity but we're also testing for

1603
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,680
efficacy to see if these products

1604
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,359
potentially could be used

1605
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:33,598
um the reason I'm super interested in

1606
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:36,779
the 25b is of finding one

1607
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,579
um is because we don't have a re-entry

1608
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,200
interval which can be very challenging

1609
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:42,780
for some of my Greenhouse facilities

1610
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:45,419
that run three shifts a day there's no

1611
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,760
shutdown time to spray pesticides and

1612
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:50,400
also for dipping cuttings coming in

1613
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,559
because right now I mean the most famous

1614
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,559
research study was done with stuff oil X

1615
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:58,019
up in Canada dipping cuttings showing

1616
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:01,019
how amazing it works

1617
01:02:58,019 --> 01:03:03,298
um no phytotoxicity I mean it it's one

1618
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:06,059
of the best things you can do but in the

1619
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:08,759
United States dipping is not on the

1620
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:11,339
label yet it's been at the EPA for years

1621
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,920
we've been waiting for it so it's coming

1622
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:15,539
but right now legally my Growers cannot

1623
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,000
take their cuttings dip them in stuff

1624
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:20,219
oil and root them even though that is

1625
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,960
one of the best way to stop you know

1626
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:23,459
like Hamp russet Mite and two spots

1627
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,940
spider mites and Broad mites from even

1628
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:30,599
getting started the 25 bees you don't

1629
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:33,900
have the the restrictions of an EPA

1630
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:36,900
label so we can just let's try dipping

1631
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,280
let's try you know drenching oh let's we

1632
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,619
can try all these different things and

1633
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,359
it's not illegal because they don't have

1634
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:44,338
restrictive labels

1635
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:46,558
so

1636
01:03:44,338 --> 01:03:47,940
um we are testing a couple products

1637
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:51,960
currently

1638
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:53,700
um and I have high hopes for these

1639
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,440
um because of the amount of research

1640
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:56,939
these companies have put into these

1641
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,358
products

1642
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:02,880
um and they're they're not just somebody

1643
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:04,920
making it at their house and you know

1644
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,940
spelling the insects wrong on the labels

1645
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:11,400
oh my God like six years ago I was at

1646
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:13,380
um oh which trade show was it it was in

1647
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,900
I think it was I almost said Comic-Con

1648
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,720
that's the wrong wrong show wrong

1649
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,760
completely at uh

1650
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:22,259
canacon and like I was looking at some

1651
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,420
of these 25b products and they didn't

1652
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:28,140
even have the pests spelled right on the

1653
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:30,900
packaging and I'm like ah how can I take

1654
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:33,000
this product seriously when you can't

1655
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,680
even spell the name right on your

1656
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,539
product it's not like it was a typo in

1657
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:38,578
an email you sent me it's on the printed

1658
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,900
label of the product and when I really

1659
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,240
would start talking to these guys in

1660
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,680
these 25 B products they bailed on the

1661
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,939
conversation and don't want to talk to

1662
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,558
me because I'm asking the tough

1663
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,559
questions

1664
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,720
um because most of these uh 25b products

1665
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:53,280
are non-selective

1666
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:57,239
um they generally are going to kill the

1667
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:59,460
pests just as equally as beneficials so

1668
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:01,199
you do have to be cautious with that and

1669
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:05,039
again you said the price point I mean I

1670
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:09,899
was calculating some of the prices and

1671
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:12,179
you know for for sixty dollars of stuff

1672
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:14,880
oil if for some of these 25 bees it's

1673
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:16,318
almost 400 for the same amount of

1674
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,539
product

1675
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:21,838
um it's it's it's crazy

1676
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:23,759
um Canada does not allow this to happen

1677
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:26,699
Canada doesn't have this exemption list

1678
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,619
also in Canada if you want to register a

1679
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:30,659
product in Canada you have to prove at

1680
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:32,870
least 80 percent efficacy to get the

1681
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:35,659
product labeled up there

1682
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:37,199
