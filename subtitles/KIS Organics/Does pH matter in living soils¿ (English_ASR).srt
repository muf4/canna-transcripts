1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,040
one uh one last question I had for you

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,400
that was sort of unrelated but one that

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,160
I I hear debated by Growers that I think

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,759
you could answer uh fairly readily is

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,640
this idea of rizosphere pH and the

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:22,960
importance of pH um some organic Growers

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,920
don't really uh don't use pH as a tool

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,519
because they say that the the soil's

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,039
ability and the microbes ability to

10
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,879
buffer is so great that it's less

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,239
important how however uh some of us like

12
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:40,119
myself feel that well there is an aspect

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,919
to that by optimizing uh pH in in

14
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,519
rizosphere and in the soil we're

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,280
allowing uh for these the plant to have

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,120
less stress and to make these

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,640
um make it easier for the plant to

18
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:57,878
uptake nutrients um yeah what what are

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,600
your thoughts on this and how do

20
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:04,599
microbes help in uh sort of that pH and

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,400
risos feere

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:11,359
relationship yes pH is very important h

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,719
under high pH if you really want to to

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,039
absorb if if you really want your plant

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,438
to absorb enough iron for the

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,759
chlorophyll to have a good color and

27
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:24,639
photosynthesis in in in the leaves uh

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,400
you please make sure that the pH will

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,400
not be above uh seven and a half even

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,759
lower than that

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,680
uh you know 68 or something like this if

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,200
you have a low PH then your plant will

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,159
not be able to absorb some of uh the

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,320
goodies that is being needed for for a

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,079
good crop uh so this is something which

36
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:51,758
should be kept in mind uh my

37
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:54,438
recommendation is uh take a nutrient

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,079
solution with a high buffer capacity and

39
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:00,359
that will helps you uh to

40
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:03,478
overcome those uh situation in the

41
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,640
ReRe so is it safe to say that the the

42
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,560
risos spere plant risos spere

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,399
interactions and the risos spere itself

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,239
is is highly complicated we are still

45
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,360
learning a lot about the soil microbiome

46
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,360
in relationship to the rizosphere

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,560
and by having the pH within uh a range

48
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,720
that is more optimal for the plant all

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,800
we're doing is making it easier for the

50
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,959
plant to access nutrients which will

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,400
potentially reduce plant stress and

52
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,519
allow it to put more energy into yield

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,519
and growth and protection yeah those SCT

54
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,519
yeah
