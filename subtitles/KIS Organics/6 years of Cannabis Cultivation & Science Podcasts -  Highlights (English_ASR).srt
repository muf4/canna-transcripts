1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,240
so I wanted to share a talk that I've

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,679
given at a couple of different

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,638
conferences in the past year I gave a

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:14,320
version of this talk at the living soil

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,678
Summit in Vegas and then just recently

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,039
in Melbourne Australia at a

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,679
pharmaceutical conference you know I

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,400
started the Cannabis cultivation and

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,278
science podcast over six years ago now

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,479
as a way to bridge the gap between

11
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:29,240
academic research and actual Growers

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,278
when I first started the podcast there

13
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,479
were very few resources for finding

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,960
accurate information and frankly my

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,159
initial interviews were less than

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,840
scientific but rather folks that I knew

17
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,519
that cultivators really wanted to hear

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,800
from as the podcast evolved I refined my

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,800
podcast to be more research-based but

20
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,280
also included cultivators that have been

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,319
successful in the industry to share you

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,239
know their real world experiences

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,439
because as many of you know rarely does

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,159
growroom environment or outside growing

25
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:01,320
conditions reach anything close to what

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,038
we would consider be optimal there's

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,680
always going to be challenges there's

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,680
always going to be

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,240
compromises most of my interviews are

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,520
with experts who have dedicated their

31
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,199
lives to a very specific aspect of

32
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,280
horiculture or biology and I consider

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,560
them to be much smarter than me I just

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,719
try to stay open-minded always keep

35
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,400
learning and ask the questions that I

36
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,519
think most Growers would want to know

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,478
the answers to and my goal today is not

38
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,599
to be exhaustive on any one topic since

39
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,679
I've done over 130 episodes to date but

40
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,078
rather just give some key takeaways and

41
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,280
then folks can go back and find those

42
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,758
guests uh and listen to that particular

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,040
podcast if they find a topic that's

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,478
really interesting or they want to know

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,280
more or you can ask questions uh in the

46
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,599
comment section below for this

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,599
particular YouTube

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,920
talk so starting off I have to pay my

49
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:03,799
respects to Clackamus cot I met him in

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,200
in the ICM uh organic soil form I'm

51
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,118
still on there from time to time and uh

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,080
the biggest thing from my all of our

53
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,159
long conversations and um you going out

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,680
to dinner and stuff like that was I

55
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:21,000
learned that as a general range a

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,040
quarter cup to a cup per cubic foot is a

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,400
pretty good place to start for most of

58
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,759
your inputs if your NPK on a particular

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
input is higher then you probably want

60
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,280
to be close to that quarter cup range if

61
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,919
it's a lower mpk input then you can

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,039
probably be closer to a cup and there's

63
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,238
there's a lot more that goes into

64
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,840
balancing there this is just a very

65
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,959
general rule uh C's also famous for

66
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,158
popularizing the Cornell soil recipe

67
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,120
that recipe is uh essentially a third a

68
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:53,318
third a third so it's a third compost a

69
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,200
third Pete Moss and a third pmus or

70
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,878
perite or whatever form of variation

71
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,359
that you have now we've modified that in

72
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,399
our mixes

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,080
uh we're we we've changed that up a

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,640
little bit uh for a few reasons one

75
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,040
because uh we find commercial compost to

76
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:12,559
be the biggest contaminant in terms of

77
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:16,318
heavy metals uh so we've reduced that

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,280
amount to closer to 15 to 20% uh we keep

79
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,518
the Iration around 30% and then we'll

80
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,479
add in biochar Pete Moss to make up the

81
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,039
difference for our base mixes but um a

82
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,479
lot of people are still running you know

83
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,239
what people call CZ mix and uh doing

84
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:34,000
well with that one thing that talks

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,840
about though is you don't have his mix

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,878
because you don't have his earthworm

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,840
castings and essentially what he's

88
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,438
saying here is you need to formulate

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,319
around your compost your compost is

90
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,280
going to be your biggest variable in

91
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,280
determining your soil recipe and that

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,000
and that's one of the reasons that I

93
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,560
don't really like online soil recipes

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,919
because everyone's using a different

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,239
compost source so really important that

96
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,318
you know your compost Source uh when

97
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,039
you're when you're going to come up the

98
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,719
recipe because it may already be in

99
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,239
calcium you don't need to add as much or

100
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,000
maybe high in potassium and you don't

101
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,840
want as as much whatever whatever

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,318
nutrient we're talking about here so

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,158
that's where soil testing really comes

104
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:17,120
in handy and that leads me to my next uh

105
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,759
guest which was Steve Solomon Steve I I

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,478
had heard of Steve before I really got

107
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,360
too far into the industry Steve had

108
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,959
written gardening west of the Cascades

109
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,400
which was a really famous book here in

110
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,279
the Puget Sound uh in the northwest

111
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,879
region and when he came out with his new

112
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,679
book The intelligent Gardener uh the

113
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,439
idea really uh spoke to me because as

114
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,560
someone who grows vegetables I wanted to

115
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,639
grow the healthiest food that I could

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,680
and that was really Steve's focus is how

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,199
do we get all the minerals back into the

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,840
soil in the proper ratios and at luxury

119
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,840
levels so that we can grow

120
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,359
nutrient-dense food because if the uh

121
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,239
soil is lacking in calcium for example

122
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,400
and then we're growing a crop that's low

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
in calcium we're not well the food that

124
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,120
we're consuming is not going to happen

125
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,000
the calcium that we need for our bodies

126
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,879
and in addition if we're taking that

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,399
waste and then re- composting it and

128
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,959
then putting it back onto our soil we're

129
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,959
exacerbating this issue of low calcium

130
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,038
so that's where soil testing and soil

131
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,879
balancing comes in and that's something

132
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,279
that we really like to do on the U

133
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,360
cannabis side of

134
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,959
things now one thing that I want to

135
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,160
highlight is that Steve's soil targets

136
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,159
and metrics are for growing nutrient

137
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,800
dened vegetables uh that's really that's

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
a really important distinction he's not

139
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,000
as interested in yield and he's

140
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,360
certainly not talking about cannabis um

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,680
and and he that's something that he

142
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,240
freely shares um and and something that

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,199
we've talked about a lot so the targets

144
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,800
for what we call living soil for

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,560
cannabis are quite different than the

146
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,280
targets for um nutrient Dent vegetables

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,280
according to his

148
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,639
book next up uh is Gaia Palmer I did I

149
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,279
did a couple different interviews with

150
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,360
ja ja's was such a good friend um he

151
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,038
passed away in

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,000
2021 I I just want to remind folks that

153
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,159
if you have friends that are dealing

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,598
with addiction and depression and things

155
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,720
like that uh that you reach out to them

156
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:20,759
and connect with them as best you can uh

157
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,960
G had uh definitely had some demons but

158
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,720
he was also one of the most

159
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,839
intelligent and uh unique people I've

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,080
ever met in my life and and frankly kiss

161
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:34,000
wouldn't exist if it weren't for G so I

162
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,758
want to pay my respects there and uh I I

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,360
think his interviews are actually quite

164
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,080
interesting given the fact that many of

165
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,680
them were were he he was at The Cutting

166
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,758
Edge of what a lot of these things are

167
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,038
that we take for granted now like VPD

168
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,680
and bio controls and all this stuff uh

169
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,199
it really wasn't around in the canvas

170
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,120
industry when he started talking about

171
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,960
it and you can kind of hear that in some

172
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,639
of my initial podcasts with

173
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,560
him one of the things that g talks about

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,199
though that I think is important to

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,959
highlight is that canopy determines your

176
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,720
yield so whether you grow one plant in

177
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,079
veget for a long time to fill a 4x4

178
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,440
space or we put nine plants in that same

179
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,000
space uh if the canopies are

180
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,199
approximately equal your yield is going

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,478
to be approximately equal all other

182
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,759
conditions the same um and that's I

183
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,399
think that's something to think about

184
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,240
when you're planting out your crop

185
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,120
depending on if you have uh number

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,400
limitations based on the regulations in

187
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,800
your

188
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,799
area the other thing that G came up with

189
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,000
was this uh initially it was sort of an

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,478
80 to 120 membar for kiss soil and

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,199
that's a good starting number for most

192
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,639
people growing in Peete based living

193
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,680
soils uh We've since modified this

194
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,759
closer to 80 to 100 we want to be a

195
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,560
little bit wetter the lower the number

196
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,598
the wetter the soil is um we have some

197
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,079
guys going as low as 60 so some people

198
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,000
are going 60 to 80 but it's really

199
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,279
important to try it out in different uh

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,319
in your media and see what works best in

201
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,598
your uh grow space but that's a good

202
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,840
starting

203
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,560
point and then one other thing that jaia

204
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,158
figured out was that communal planting

205
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,680
has increased yield benefits so I met G

206
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,598
one day I was literally mixing soils in

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,360
my parents' driveway when we had the

208
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,478
compost tea business and he stopped by

209
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,879
to get some compost tea ingredients and

210
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,199
I just gave him some of the soil I was

211
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,759
making said try this out with your

212
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,919
plants let me know what you think I

213
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,158
wasn't even growing cannabis at the

214
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:33,319
time and uh he came back

215
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,158
uh a couple months later and really was

216
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,959
super interested in the soil because

217
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:40,080
that soil would just water outperformed

218
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,199
his program that he was running I think

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
I think he was running bobiz or one of

220
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,560
the bottled Botanicare bottled nutrients

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,480
at the time um some organic line and so

222
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,319
then he started experimenting with this

223
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,680
soil and growing in seven gallon pots

224
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,760
and he took all those pots and put them

225
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,559
in a flood

226
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,000
tray kind of all mashed together and and

227
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,278
then he and he noticed that the roots

228
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,639
were starting to grow together and he

229
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,278
saidwell why not um just put them all in

230
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,519
the flood tray so initially he just

231
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,360
filled the flood tray and then he

232
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,679
realized the soil depth wasn't enough so

233
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,639
then he increased the depth and and

234
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,278
started growing in essentially a raiseed

235
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:21,000
bed with pond liner uh and and that was

236
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,399
the most successful thing because for

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,799
those of you that grew up um in states

238
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,720
where it may not have been legal to grow

239
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,278
it was the sketchiest thing you know

240
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,320
trying to move soil out of your garage

241
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:36,000
or out of your basement at 3 o'clock in

242
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,000
the morning um you know trying to trying

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,320
to do that was always sketchy so if we

244
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,200
could reuse the soil and just bring in

245
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,440
nutrients to replace what was taken out

246
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,640
by the plant uh that was going to reduce

247
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,920
risk and reduce labor and make

248
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,519
everything simpler and we've since

249
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:53,000
modified this process to um commercial

250
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,240
facilities but that's really where it

251
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,559
all

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,959
started okay moving on to the bug lady

253
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:04,239
Suzanne way wght Evans dear dear friend

254
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,239
of mine she is the best entomologist um

255
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,159
INF field

256
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,919
entomologist um I'm aware of in the

257
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,919
United States maybe in the world she

258
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,639
works in um ornamentals she works in

259
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,278
horiculture she works in cannabis uh she

260
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,319
really knows her Pest and this is the

261
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,000
stuff that she's taught me through our

262
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,040
conversations and I've done multiple

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,720
podcasts with her and I I highly suggest

264
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:30,199
you check them out so step one it always

265
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,278
begins with a positive ID you need to

266
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,759
know what the pest is because um they

267
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,519
can have different life cycles and

268
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,679
without understanding the pest you

269
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,759
really can't begin to develop a a

270
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,679
program for treating or managing the

271
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,078
pest and one of the other things that

272
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,359
she highlights that I think is important

273
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,799
to realize is that pests cannot develop

274
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,879
a resistance to being eaten this is

275
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,639
important because when we apply chemical

276
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,399
fertilizers over time or even organic

277
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,879
fertilizers pest can develop a

278
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,200
resistance to that and if they survive

279
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,958
due to that resistance they're going to

280
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,839
be more resistant uh to Future

281
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,838
applications that's why we change our

282
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,560
modes of application so um we're not

283
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,839
constantly using the same pesticide over

284
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,000
and over again but when we use

285
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,839
beneficial

286
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,679
insects uh that's not a concern and

287
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,240
they're working 247 for you in your room

288
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,759
getting to all the places that you may

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,680
not have reached with your sprayer so um

290
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,799
bringing in the right beneficials at the

291
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,519
right time in the grow is is

292
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,519
huge and then this one is one that most

293
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,759
people know but I just want to throw it

294
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,759
out there as a reminder because when I

295
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,439
first started spraying my plants with

296
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,159
pesticides you know like an oilbased

297
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,880
spray for example and and pesticides

298
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,039
don't necessarily mean chemical

299
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,600
pesticides you know I'm also talking

300
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,759
about things like neem oil Horticultural

301
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,000
oils um you know sulfur whatever all of

302
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,838
these things that we use in the organic

303
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,440
side

304
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,000
there're still pesticides um you always

305
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,639
want to apply them at the label rate so

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,679
I was thinking okay I'm going to be

307
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,519
ecologically friendly I'm going to apply

308
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:14,399
my pesticide at the lowest rate I can

309
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,679
because uh I just I don't want to be

310
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,879
spraying pesticides anyway well the

311
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,958
problem with that is when you apply a

312
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,439
pesticide at below the label rate you're

313
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,799
allowing that plant to develop a

314
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,240
resistance this is that issue that weal

315
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,679
I just talked about so

316
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,919
always important to apply label rates

317
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,879
because those label rates are

318
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,838
established to give you the maximum

319
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:42,879
killing effect uh with the minimum RI

320
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,199
minimal risk of phytotoxicity so um you

321
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,480
always want to follow the label rates

322
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,679
and they'll usually give you a range and

323
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,839
you could stay at the lower end of the

324
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,559
range depending on how much pest

325
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,560
pressure you have but that's always a

326
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,838
good idea to make sure to follow those

327
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,039
label rates those label rates if it's an

328
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,760
EPA registered product are the law and

329
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,559
you have to follow them especially if

330
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,399
you're a commercial facility and always

331
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,399
make sure to wear the proper PPE as

332
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,519
well one other thing that she mentions I

333
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:12,958
think is important to bring up is that

334
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,399
it's best to apply beneficials early

335
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,198
when the plant canopy is smaller when

336
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,919
your application rates are lower and

337
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,719
before we get too far in flour because

338
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,919
if you get into flour not only can you

339
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,079
not really spray anything once pistol

340
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,799
development is started but it's also too

341
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,719
late if you have a big outbreak if you

342
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,559
see

343
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,560
webbing for example from two spot

344
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,479
spidermites you know laid in flower you

345
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,879
could apply beneficials but they're

346
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
probably it's probably too late in the

347
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,600
game at that point so it's really a

348
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,359
great preventative I like to do a couple

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,399
of preventive or mainit sprays and then

350
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,919
bring in my beneficials after I've done

351
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,198
a couple rounds of sprays and then

352
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:56,719
that's sort of my beginning IPM in veg

353
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:59,078
so always use the beneficials um as soon

354
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,240
as you can in the plant's life after

355
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:03,399
after you're done spraying whatever

356
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,360
whatever it is you might be spraying on

357
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,799
your

358
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,919
plants and then lastly Suzanne there's a

359
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:14,000
ton of bad information um online I see

360
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:16,719
people getting recommendations for their

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,198
IPM program from Facebook or Instagram

362
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,399
or forums um always good to have an

363
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:23,639
entomologist in your corner or reach out

364
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,278
to someone who has access to an

365
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,720
entomologist to make sure that you're

366
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,639
getting accurate information and if you

367
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,360
have a commercial facility

368
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,399
you know I I've talked to Suzanne about

369
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,480
this multiple times I just had this

370
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,480
conversation with her this week where

371
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,199
she went and visit a facility that was

372
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,920
working with a different uh consultant

373
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,240
who was a rep for a

374
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,919
insectary and basically they were having

375
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,120
them over

376
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:54,120
apply the beneficials and they were

377
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:57,360
spraying too many products to where uh

378
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,480
her visit was paid for within a month

379
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,399
just from what they were spreading on on

380
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,079
uh pesticides and beneficial insects

381
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,278
because their program was not optimized

382
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:10,078
uh from from from a cost perspective so

383
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:12,559
if you're a commercial facility and you

384
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,559
have a robust IPM program it's always

385
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,439
good to have a professional like Suzanne

386
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,758
look at over and make sure that you're

387
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,000
not overspending too because people do

388
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,159
go that route as

389
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,278
well and then lastly uh please don't buy

390
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,600
ladybugs again something I thought was

391
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,679
ecologically friendly um in fact they're

392
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,519
Wild harvested I did a whole podcast on

393
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,399
ladybugs and why you don't want to buy

394
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,519
them it's actually pretty interesting if

395
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,278
you want to check that out but they are

396
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,240
wild harvested they spread disease to

397
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,559
Native populations and if you let them

398
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,318
go outside they're probably just going

399
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:49,239
to fly away so one more thing to think

400
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:53,120
about uh when we talk about beneficial

401
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,919
insects all right next is Ben Hartman

402
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,318
this is a book that I think everybody

403
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,360
should read um if I owned a commercial

404
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,479
facility I would make all of my

405
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,199
cultivators and even all my processors

406
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,959
and everyone in that worked for me read

407
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:10,318
this book um it's all about minimizing

408
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,518
waste and maximizing

409
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:15,318
efficiency it's all based off of the

410
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,480
whole Toyota concept of lean

411
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:19,639
manufacturing Ben did a great job of

412
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,639
converting it into a mental model that

413
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,639
works for farming but really it works

414
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,278
for all aspects of your lives so the

415
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,560
whole idea is to reduce muda and muda is

416
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,759
waste and waste can be

417
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,278
um

418
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,440
wasted uh food that you know you didn't

419
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:39,120
get processed it could be waste in the

420
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,240
form of a pile of of stuff in the corner

421
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,839
of a of your I don't know corner of your

422
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,519
room that needs cleaning up um it could

423
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:51,959
be waste in the form of

424
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,480
uh time like you're spending time trying

425
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,799
like when I had a farm I would spend

426
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,319
time if I wanted to start a project it

427
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,000
might take me 20 minutes to get all the

428
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:01,120
tools I needed to start the project and

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,440
I think well shoot by the time I get all

430
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,160
the tools together I'm not even going to

431
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,720
have time to do the project so that was

432
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,839
a that was a waste um and then the last

433
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,600
waste is this mental waste this idea

434
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,519
that we have things that are constantly

435
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,198
in the back of our head that we know we

436
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,160
need to do and we just don't seem to be

437
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,600
getting around to it that's a form of

438
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,160
muda as well um so it's it's a great way

439
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,639
to just be a more efficient grower and

440
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,600
more efficient with your

441
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,280
time it's all about getting the right

442
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,599
tools in the right location to SA time

443
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,558
and

444
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,839
money um and I will add just a funny

445
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:39,119
story um over at Gold Leaf Gardens the

446
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,399
uh Nate over there had all his guys read

447
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,959
the book and it was so funny because one

448
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,600
of them was coming up to me Buddha and

449
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,038
he's like yo I'm I've been you know

450
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,079
getting into this whole lean farming

451
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,119
thing um my toilet paper you know we

452
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,399
were keeping in the garage now I keep it

453
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,678
in the bathroom so it's right there

454
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,798
where I need it when I need it um and

455
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,519
it's just more efficient you know and

456
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,798
it's just funny how we can incorporate

457
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,359
these things into our life to be more

458
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:08,359
efficient with our

459
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:11,319
time all right Dr yorm kapulnik um he's

460
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,158
with the Volcan Institute he was one of

461
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:16,359
the creators of

462
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,200
dinoo and uh he really changed my mind

463
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:24,000
about how I felt about micro isal

464
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,200
fungi so what he talked about is um and

465
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,159
I think this is important to keep in

466
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,960
mind for all microorganisms whether it's

467
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,960
micro fungi or Bavaria

468
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,880
traderma when we say these These are

469
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,279
sort of think of them more like

470
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:43,640
categories um in the sense that they're

471
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,839
not all the same product so for example

472
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,440
the

473
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:50,359
Israeli

474
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:53,960
dyo is comes from a very um Aid

475
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:57,558
environment so it has very good drought

476
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,880
Toler tolerance um it can handle a wider

477
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:02,359
range of temp so we're talking about

478
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,480
those abiotic conditions maybe then some

479
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:07,399
of the other um micro risal products on

480
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,360
the market and frankly there aren't that

481
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,440
many microle manufacturers most of them

482
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,678
are coming from just a few

483
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,440
sources so that's something to keep in

484
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,880
mind too but with Bavaria you know for

485
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,519
example if that particular Bavaria

486
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,640
species was uh discovered on say like a

487
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,839
grasshopper that particular Bavaria

488
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,000
product may have better efficacy with

489
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,240
grasshoppers but it may not have as good

490
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,960
of efficacy with say another species of

491
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,720
insect so to say that all Bavaria is

492
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,720
going to perform the same is not is not

493
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,960
very accurate you really need to try out

494
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,240
a few different ones and find out what

495
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,759
gives you the best efficacy now just to

496
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,880
further complicate all of that we found

497
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,558
that some companies some quite popular

498
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,400
um companies here in you know the

499
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,480
organic living Soul Space are selling

500
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,159
Bavaria that doesn't even have a Spore

501
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,200
count high enough to allow for any level

502
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,720
of

503
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,080
efficacy so you really need to know

504
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,960
where you're getting your product and

505
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,759
know that that product is that is good

506
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,000
otherwise you're just wasting your money

507
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,440
and I know this because um one of my

508
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,279
pathologist friends purchased it tested

509
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,679
it and and looked at the Spore numbers

510
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,599
and then on the flip side there's

511
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,280
another company not in the living soil

512
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:25,959
space but out there that's selling um

513
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,599
Bavaria and their claims for Spore

514
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,840
counts are higher than would physically

515
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,639
be possible to fit into that volume of a

516
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:36,519
container so it's not it's just not even

517
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,240
possible so um really important to to

518
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:42,079
look for a good source when we talk

519
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,480
about buying um micro

520
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,558
products and then one other thing that I

521
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,038
wasn't really aware of was that micro

522
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,038
isal fungi and traderma can be

523
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,119
symbiotic a lot of products have them in

524
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,880
there together but traderma can be very

525
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,558
aggressive but it what they found is

526
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,440
that the certain species can work quite

527
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:06,399
well with micro isal fungi so um if you

528
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,120
wanted to do a micro isal uh

529
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,440
application uh you know early on when

530
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,278
you first transplant a rooted cutting

531
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,000
for example or have a Seedling then you

532
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:18,159
could follow that up a few weeks later

533
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,159
with a trichoderma application something

534
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,000
like root shield and that would be just

535
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:27,039
fine uh one other note that I wanted to

536
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,319
add here is that U and I'll talk about

537
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,038
this more in my heavy metals talk but

538
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,759
there is research that shows that micro

539
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,359
isof fungi increases the uptake of heavy

540
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,158
metals along with all these other

541
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,278
beneficial nutrients so microle fungi

542
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,120
has a ton of benefits I highly recommend

543
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:43,919
checking out the podcast but keep in

544
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,199
mind too that if you're in a state where

545
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,000
you're regulated for heavy metals you

546
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,319
may want to just be careful and think

547
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,400
about using this because it will

548
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:57,278
increase uh heavy metal

549
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,559
uptake all right Don Marshall Don is a

550
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:02,640
dear friend of mine uh

551
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:06,079
he established uh the Horticultural

552
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,559
college at Lake Washington and he uh or

553
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:12,079
the program there and he ran it for like

554
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:15,158
30 or 40 years um I went back to school

555
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,199
just to take his botany program prior to

556
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,840
him retiring the last year before he

557
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,200
retired because he is the best educator

558
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,158
I'm so grateful to know him and I'm

559
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,720
working on putting together a botney

560
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,440
class an online botney class for folks

561
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,759
that so that people can take his course

562
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,120
online uh here in the

563
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:37,879
future but one of the things Don talks

564
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:39,239
about in his podcast I with him and I

565
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,960
think this is interesting and this is

566
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,159
where it's important to understand the

567
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,798
mechanism behind

568
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:49,159
why plants do the things that they do or

569
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,639
what the mechanism of action is from a

570
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,320
plant physiology perspective

571
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,799
because um it's all about in this case

572
00:22:54,319 --> 00:23:00,519
root hair death so root hair is where uh

573
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,918
nutrient and water uptake occurs and so

574
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:03,879
if you are

575
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,120
overwatering you're going to be killing

576
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,240
root hairs and potentially creating

577
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,239
environment that's going to be better

578
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,960
for pathogen growth uh if you're

579
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,599
underwatering you're also going to be

580
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,159
killing root hairs now these root hairs

581
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:19,519
will regrow but the they will both give

582
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,278
you a similar above ground display in

583
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,119
terms of symptoms because they both

584
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:25,960
cause a reduction in nutrient uptake due

585
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,158
to this root hair death which I think is

586
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,798
really interesting because people look

587
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,240
at a wilting plant and they just oh

588
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,440
that's underwatered but in fact it could

589
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,079
be massively overwatered because they're

590
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,720
going to have same symptomatic

591
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,038
conditions and understanding why I think

592
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,319
is really

593
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,720
important and one of the things that Don

594
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:46,918
highlights is you need to be a detective

595
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,919
in your growth so you need to do this

596
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,400
first thing in the morning not at the

597
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,000
end of the day after you've talked to uh

598
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,960
you know hundred people and made a

599
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
million decisions and you're tired but

600
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,120
right when you first go to your

601
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,038
Greenhouse or to go you you know go see

602
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,959
your plants you need to look around the

603
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:07,359
room and say see what's going on you

604
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,038
know what's what's my limiting factor of

605
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,199
growth and sometimes it's fertility but

606
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:15,000
people always assume it's fertility um

607
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,919
it could very well be your irrigation

608
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,919
the way you're Watering your plants it

609
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,640
could be CO2 it could be light intensity

610
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,240
um all of these things all work

611
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,360
together and so what you need to do is

612
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,720
always be thinking about what the

613
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,918
limiting factor of growth because

614
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,360
there's always something and you just

615
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,080
need to keep checking those off and

616
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,278
checking those off and keep improving

617
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:41,319
things so there's no reason for example

618
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:45,759
to go buy a hype

619
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:49,038
ferment um or biological product if my

620
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:52,519
limiting factor of growth is light or

621
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:54,640
the way I'm watering um and if you do

622
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,079
find that one of those you know products

623
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
makes a difference then you have to go

624
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,599
backwards and figure out why it made a

625
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,319
difference what was it addressing in

626
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:05,678
terms of nutrients in terms of biology

627
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,079
in terms of whatever aspect was limiting

628
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,720
your plant's growth so just always good

629
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,240
to be a plant detective in that regard

630
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,480
um and it's something that I always

631
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,038
think about now when I approach plants

632
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,558
um in a new

633
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:24,710
situation Lee Bree Lee does not work in

634
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:26,678
cannabis either um he is a plant

635
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,880
[Music]

636
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,120
doctor independent prop consultant sorry

637
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,640
as a doctor at implant Health um he

638
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:40,319
works in agriculture but I really loved

639
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:43,880
his perspective and approach to uh plant

640
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,000
health so he loves soil testing but he

641
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,760
does it primarily to support what he's

642
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,278
already seeing feeling and smelling in

643
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:53,200
the field for example you can scoop up a

644
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,720
handful of soil you can smell those

645
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,720
actino bacteria uh you know what healthy

646
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,759
soil smells like you can feel the tilth

647
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,079
of the soil what levels of sand silt and

648
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:08,038
Clay are in there um you can see with

649
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:10,199
your your eyes visually how the plant is

650
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:12,839
responding to the fertility that's

651
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,399
getting so um the soil testing is really

652
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,398
there to support that and I think that's

653
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:19,319
important we can't rely solely on soil

654
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,319
testing I think there needs to be a

655
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:24,759
check some checks and balances between

656
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:26,599
the soil testing and how our plant looks

657
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,319
um because at the end of the day that

658
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,839
soil test really doesn't matter what

659
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,558
matters is our plants and how they're

660
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,639
responding um to whatever fertility

661
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,960
we're giving

662
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,880
them and then the other thing that Lee

663
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,679
talks about that I think is important is

664
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:48,120
um this idea that egg is not a natural

665
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:51,038
system um you know you hear people say

666
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,918
well no one's know putting Miracle Grow

667
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,679
out on the

668
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,278
rainforest um yet we're able to grow

669
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,200
these healthy happy plants um what would

670
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,000
Mother Nature do this idea of biomimicry

671
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,600
you know and imitating what nature does

672
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,278
well Mother Nature doesn't have weeds

673
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:10,519
they're just plants Mother Nature um has

674
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,278
pests you know what we would call pests

675
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,798
um there's in you go out and look around

676
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:16,759
your yard you'll see that there's insect

677
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,079
damage on pretty much all your plants um

678
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,079
keep there's checks and balances there

679
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,798
to keep things in place and what causes

680
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:26,079
those checks and balances is the level

681
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,558
of diversity and ecology that is there

682
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,918
but when we talk about growing a

683
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:33,918
particular crop which means growing one

684
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,520
plant primarily to the exclusion of

685
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:40,240
pretty much all others um it's not a

686
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:42,158
natural system so while we can use what

687
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,558
nature does we want to look at it from

688
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,640
the perspective of um the fact that it's

689
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:51,480
not a natural system what is going to

690
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,880
make a difference in the health of our

691
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,278
crop and some of those practices like

692
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,760
bringing in organic matter um you know

693
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,359
in mulching cover cropping um those

694
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,759
things make a lot of sense in an outdoor

695
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,839
environment indoors where we can control

696
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,038
every aspect of a plant's growth or

697
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,558
health um is it's very much not a

698
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:12,839
natural system and we want to keep that

699
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:14,599
in mind when we're making decisions

700
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,079
about our growth

701
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,319
so I thought he did a good job speaking

702
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,879
about

703
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:24,759
that all right Brandon Hudson Brandon

704
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,799
works for kiss um he does all the

705
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:31,960
Agronomy for us and

706
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,720
he's been growing now for oh shoot

707
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,120
almost 40 years I think so a ton of

708
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,600
experience and he's grown he's grown

709
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,798
with salts now he only grows Organics um

710
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,918
but he he just has a ton of experience

711
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,398
um ran a commercial hemp facility for a

712
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,960
long time and so um one of the things

713
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:54,158
that Brandon really talks about and

714
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,159
explains so well is this idea of a

715
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,120
dichotomus key and he put together an

716
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,120
article it's on the kiss website uh you

717
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,278
can check it out under the blog page

718
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,359
under learn and essentially what it is

719
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:08,240
it's a mental checklist it's this idea

720
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:09,158
that Don talked about about being a

721
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,519
plant

722
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,120
detective um all laid out for you with

723
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,480
mental mapping so is your problem biotic

724
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,879
or

725
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,720
abiotic you know is it caused by

726
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:26,440
temperature or um sunlight or is your

727
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,480
problem caused by an insect or a pest

728
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,840
for example um he looks at and he

729
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,399
explains like all the different

730
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,558
deficiencies that you may see from a

731
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,798
nutrient

732
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:37,000
perspective and then how we can address

733
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:39,798
these

734
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,919
things so um I highly recommend checking

735
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:45,119
it out I did have him on the podcast

736
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,399
talking about the dichotomus key as well

737
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,798
and one of the things he talks about is

738
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,038
just following the science you know

739
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:52,278
we're constantly learning um he's one of

740
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,599
the more Curious people that I've ever

741
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:56,119
met um and he's always challenged me in

742
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:59,480
that regard to keep on learning new

743
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:02,000
things and so you know he's he just did

744
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,839
a podcast with Mr growt recently talking

745
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,880
about um you know myths within the

746
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:09,798
Cannabis industry stuff like white ash

747
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,720
he he talks about the science behind

748
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:16,119
that um so really important that we

749
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,319
always look to science first rather than

750
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:22,479
what we see on social media or what um

751
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,839
influencers may be telling

752
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,440
us and then one of the things that

753
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:31,398
Brandon is really good at is pathogen

754
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:35,840
prevention and he does this by not

755
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:40,239
skiing out on um his his spray routine

756
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:43,678
um by keeping his space very clean and

757
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,558
staying ahead of the game on this um I

758
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,880
tend to be a little bit more of a lazy

759
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:49,960
grower and I'm not as good about this

760
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,760
sort of thing and you know it shows here

761
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,440
in the Northwest you have to stay ahead

762
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,398
of things with sprays you know microbial

763
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,200
sprays for example if you want to

764
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,558
prevent powdery mildew if you want to

765
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,278
prevent petritis on your outdoor crop

766
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,759
and Brandon's really good about that you

767
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,599
know staying to his schedule journaling

768
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,359
what he's doing every time he goes into

769
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:11,719
the grow room so he has notes and then

770
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,319
uh making sure to stay ahead of it so

771
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,759
something to think about in your

772
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:21,038
grow now as I'm recording this talk I

773
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:25,599
just recently published a podcast with

774
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,558
Dr Nicole goce and she's amazing she's

775
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,038
she's a

776
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,798
pathologist um she's at the University

777
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:34,038
of

778
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:36,398
Kentucky and I the latest podcast has so

779
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:38,919
many gems I this is based off of her

780
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,879
first podcast with me but one of the

781
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,120
things she talks about is there's very

782
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,760
few cannabis pathogens that are easily

783
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,678
identifiable from images you really need

784
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,839
to send them off to a pathologist um to

785
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,360
make sure that you understand what

786
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,119
you're dealing with so that just like

787
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:57,079
with insects so you can come up with a

788
00:31:54,119 --> 00:32:00,759
prop proper plan of action um you know

789
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:02,918
recently here in the Northwest I get

790
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:05,720
this uh it looks like powdery mde this

791
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:09,960
sort of white covering on the leaf it's

792
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,798
not visible when in the morning dew but

793
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,679
after the Dew dries you'll see these

794
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,918
splotches of white again it looks like

795
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,679
pm on different places all over the

796
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,159
plant and I you know I looked at it

797
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:25,278
under the dino light with a microscope I

798
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,679
I'm not able to identify it so I sent it

799
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,480
off to uh Dr goce and I can't wait to

800
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,278
hear her tell me what it is the only

801
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,319
thing I can think it might be is

802
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,519
something related to Leaf Hoppers

803
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,798
because that seems to be the one thing

804
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,558
that's vectoring across these plants

805
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:44,599
currently it's only on my um autoflowers

806
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,440
it's not on my photo period plants but

807
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:48,398
I've seen it on them in previous years

808
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,798
so I'm excited to get it identified so I

809
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,199
can know how to treat it or even know if

810
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,200
it's something I need to

811
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,200
treat uh one of the other things she

812
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
shares is that there's actually two

813
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,519
species of powder M that can infect

814
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,759
cannabis and one can survive and thrive

815
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:09,319
at a 40% humidity so um it's important

816
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:11,599
to know what you're dealing with so that

817
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,879
you can treat it appropriately and the

818
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,558
reason I say this is because

819
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,559
traditionally we would say okay well I

820
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:21,200
need to drop my humidity down to a level

821
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:24,398
that PM can't survive well at 40% not

822
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,200
only are you stressing your plant but um

823
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,158
in the case of in case of this one

824
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,080
species of PM it actually can do quite

825
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,278
well

826
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:35,240
so this is this is important to know and

827
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,079
then also that these uh powdery milde

828
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,519
species can have a wide Host range

829
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:40,519
meaning that they and they can display

830
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,519
differently on different plants so that

831
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,399
powdery mildew on your squash um is

832
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,599
actually probably the same PM that

833
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:50,638
you're getting on your plants um same

834
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:54,079
with your cucumbers so it's important to

835
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:55,119
know that um because I'd always thought

836
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,918
oh there're all there's all these

837
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,518
different species of powdering mildew

838
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:00,759
the one-on-one plant is probably not the

839
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,558
one affecting my other plant but that's

840
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:05,079
not totally the case some of these have

841
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,759
pretty wide host ranges and one of the

842
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:11,799
things she mentions is that curbit tend

843
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,960
to uh have the same species of PM as

844
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,720
cannabis and that's something she

845
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,320
mentioned in the latest podcast so that

846
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,799
was new information to me so now I'm

847
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,879
going to be more careful in the future

848
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,599
with my pumpkins my squash my cucumbers

849
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,000
and keeping them away from any cannabis

850
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,359
crops to make sure I'm not going to get

851
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,960
em transferring across or staying ahead

852
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:30,480
of the game with my spring on on those

853
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,159
plants because um traditionally I will

854
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,199
always get pm on my squash plants uh

855
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,358
here in the Northwest it's rather

856
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,878
inevitable and then this is just always

857
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:42,519
a good reminder but whenever I go to a

858
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,358
new facility I always like to pop a

859
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:47,239
plant out of a pot typically in veg and

860
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,119
just take a look at the

861
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,519
roots you know do they have white

862
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,760
healthy roots with good root hairs or

863
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,079
are their Roots Brown and slimy is the

864
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,359
plant girdling at all because they

865
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:02,720
haven't trans planted you know in a

866
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:04,598
proper amount of time um and one of the

867
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,879
things is that pythium is pretty easy to

868
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,920
identify um it's typically only an issue

869
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,160
on young plants and they can outgrow it

870
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,760
uh but these are things that we can

871
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,239
start there are some things that we can

872
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,000
identify

873
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:23,519
visually all right Dr Bruce

874
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,199
bugby now this podcast uh I did do a

875
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,719
podcast with him but some of this I'm

876
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:31,118
going to share is new information that

877
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,480
came from a podcast he did with uh migro

878
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,960
recently and one of the things is we've

879
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,519
known that cannabis is a highlight plant

880
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,679
you know similar to Corn but it can

881
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,759
handle levels even higher um in the

882
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,480
recent trials that he did upwards of

883
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,839
2300 ppfd with yields continually

884
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,920
increasing now you have to take that

885
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,358
with a caveat because there are some

886
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,639
lighting companies out there that are

887
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:57,239
pushing more light more light more light

888
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:01,639
which is not a sustainable approach one

889
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:03,078
because it's it's it's not good for um

890
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,598
our environment in terms of the amount

891
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:09,599
of energy that we're using and having to

892
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,119
create but also because from an economic

893
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,680
perspective those yields may be slightly

894
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,280
higher but they're not increasing uh at

895
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:21,078
a linear rate so the yields go down as

896
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,240
the light goes above so the the economic

897
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:27,839
threshold where we want to be uh is

898
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:31,519
around 1,00 to 1300 ppfd

899
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:34,679
um when we're supplementing CO2 at 1,200

900
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,079
parts per million um and everything is

901
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,399
dialed in and I think that's an

902
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,800
important factor I would tend to go even

903
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,318
a little bit lower than this because you

904
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,800
have to remember this is Bruce growing

905
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:48,159
in a growth chamber this is not a

906
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,240
typical facility situation with living

907
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,480
soil where we have a lot more variables

908
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,639
going on so I would tend to aim for

909
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,760
1,000 to 1100 initially um and then you

910
00:36:55,639 --> 00:37:00,838
can always ramp up but if you you are

911
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,359
running CO2 you do want to run higher

912
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:06,119
ppfd now um if you aren't able to run

913
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:09,159
CO2 let's say you have a home grow and

914
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,280
it's just not feasible then 800 to 1,000

915
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:13,879
ppfd is optimal when you're not

916
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,880
supplementing

917
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,318
CO2 and young plants can handle

918
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,760
highlight too this is something new that

919
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:23,599
I haven't had a chance to really play

920
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,200
around with but he claims a th000 ppfd

921
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,760
in veg is fine with CO2 supplementation

922
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,318
and will cut veg times down

923
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,720
substantially meaning we'll getting get

924
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:34,000
a lot more growth this is really

925
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,759
interesting I would caution people to

926
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,079
work their way up to this I wouldn't

927
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,440
just throw plants under a th000 ppfd in

928
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:45,039
veg but I think this is definitely worth

929
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,960
exploring um as a side note if you are

930
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,920
interested in lighting at all um I've

931
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,240
been working with a wonderful company

932
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,440
that's a NASA spin-off uh their company

933
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,598
name is bios the website is bios

934
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:01,039
lighting and I I work with them uh with

935
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,680
lot of um lighting proposals so whether

936
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,440
you need one light or you know 500

937
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,519
lights we've done we've worked with

938
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,039
people on both sides of that um It's a

939
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,639
Wonderful light with a seven-year

940
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,480
warranty um I think for the price it's

941
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,519
the best light in the industry and it's

942
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,000
what I use over in my

943
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,880
Grove at my house and I'm very happy

944
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,480
with it so just want to throw that out

945
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,920
there for anyone looking for lighting

946
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,880
just hit me

947
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,680
up uh Bryant Mason Bryant is another

948
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,760
good friend he is an

949
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,679
agronomist uh and some of the things

950
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,359
that he talks about I've done multiple

951
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,039
lives with him on YouTube you can check

952
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:39,679
out as well as uh interviews for the

953
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,159
podcast but one things that we both

954
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:45,679
agree on is that pH matters in Organics

955
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:47,879
and living soils um fortunately with

956
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,440
Organics and living soils the pH will

957
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,160
tend to fall into a a range that's

958
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,039
acceptable let's say 66 to

959
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:59,799
72 but if we can get that pH dialed in

960
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,318
into to a a good range the plant's going

961
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,560
to be able to put more of its energy

962
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:08,440
into other things rather than

963
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,920
um pH management so that's where we

964
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,960
always want to start with getting our pH

965
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,800
into optimal ranges for plant health and

966
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,480
too low of a pH frankly can really

967
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,119
increase your heavy metal uptake um

968
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,960
another thing that Bryant talks about

969
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,480
and Steve Salman's talked about this

970
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,159
well as well is that gypsum has a very

971
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,039
low solubility rating so um and a very

972
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,078
low salt index because of that soluble

973
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,000
rating so you can use a lot of it with

974
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,760
very little risk you know it's going

975
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,960
it's calcium sulfate so it's giving you

976
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:40,079
calcium and sulfur it's not really

977
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:42,318
impacting pH and so um that's one

978
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,519
amendment that I think you can be very

979
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:46,719
heavy-handed with and experiment with

980
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,000
because typically if we don't get enough

981
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,279
calcium into the plant early on in the

982
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,039
plant's life and throughout all the way

983
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,680
through flower it's going to impact um a

984
00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:01,480
variety of plant physiological functions

985
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:03,399
and um impact our yield and plant Health

986
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,440
dramatically one other thing that Bryant

987
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,440
talks about is

988
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,440
nitrogen so there's research that shows

989
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:13,879
that maximum nit nitrogen use efficiency

990
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,200
occurs when plants use various forms of

991
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,800
nitrogen um so that

992
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:22,199
means we want to try and think about you

993
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,880
know not just using one source for

994
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,679
nitrogen but multiple

995
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,640
sources and then uh when you incorporate

996
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:31,239
carbon based nitrogen it increases

997
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:33,838
nitrogen efficiency and what he's

998
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:35,598
talking about there is things like

999
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,078
anything with a meal at the end of it so

1000
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:42,960
feather meal fish meal blood meal all of

1001
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,400
those come with that carbon um component

1002
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,760
in there which will again increase that

1003
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,240
efficiency of nitrogen some one of the

1004
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,240
advantages we have as organic

1005
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:56,679
Growers and then there's a lot of hype

1006
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,280
around amino acids you hear a lot of

1007
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,399
people say you aminos and they're

1008
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,280
typically derived from soy um one thing

1009
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,760
that Bryant points out is that all

1010
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,680
organic products when we talk about

1011
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,839
these different meals feather meal fish

1012
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,519
meal whatever are either composed of or

1013
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,119
end up as amino acids these are proteins

1014
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:17,599
and fish meal for example is quite high

1015
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,720
in protein um so in through the process

1016
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,720
of mineralization we're we're getting

1017
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:25,838
those amino acids um so he's on the

1018
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:27,838
fence as to whether or not we need to

1019
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,440
purchase um

1020
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,400
directly amino acid products or if we

1021
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,240
can just continue to use these

1022
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,000
amendments because they're going to be

1023
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:40,199
mineralized into an amino acid form um

1024
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,119
through through the organic process

1025
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,118
anyway through nutrient

1026
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:49,639
cycling Dr Wendy's zelner uh this along

1027
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,480
with Dr goce probably my two favorite

1028
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:55,159
podcasts at the moment

1029
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,679
um

1030
00:41:55,159 --> 00:42:02,279
silicon is uh such a fascinating element

1031
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,838
it's highly abundant um and has a ton of

1032
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,960
different plant benefits um it mitigates

1033
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:11,119
plant stress reduces heavy metal uptake

1034
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,480
uh there was a study actually done by Dr

1035
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,318
Nicole goce the pathologist that found a

1036
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:20,000
70% reduction in powdery mildew using

1037
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:22,279
molite which is calcium

1038
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
silicate it increases your heat and

1039
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,880
drought resistance it reduces salt

1040
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,159
stress enhances UV tolerance and reduces

1041
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:36,440
sodium and chloride uptake it really is

1042
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:38,719
that miracle drug that Miracle um

1043
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,838
fertilizer uh it's the one thing that

1044
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,879
kind of meets all of those uh all of

1045
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,400
those standards and interestingly enough

1046
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,519
you know when we talk about hyper

1047
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,800
accumulators like cannabis or rice for

1048
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:57,599
example if soils have insufficient

1049
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,440
levels of silicon then the plant will

1050
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,440
uptake arsenic through that same

1051
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,519
pathway and Si availabity availability

1052
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:09,800
varies dramatically based on your parent

1053
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,880
material and Source uh and this is sort

1054
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,599
of the order from most available to

1055
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,720
least available so an amorphous form

1056
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:20,119
would be something like pottassium

1057
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,078
silicate that eggs 16h you know I think

1058
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,160
we sell a pound of it for like 20 bucks

1059
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,720
it allows you to make up a gallon of

1060
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,558
liquid potassium silicate it's what's in

1061
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,719
most of of those you know silica

1062
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,200
products on the market just you get to

1063
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,318
add the water yourself and save a ton of

1064
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,358
money um and that's one of the best

1065
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:41,960
forms of Si from an availability

1066
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:45,159
perspective and then biogenic would be

1067
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,440
plant-based sources of silica so things

1068
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:50,399
you know silica derived from bamboo for

1069
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,079
example would fall under that category

1070
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,400
um that tends to be the next most

1071
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,599
available though you do have to be

1072
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,480
careful with um the potential for heavy

1073
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,760
metals for example with rice

1074
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,159
HS a lot of people like to use rice hes

1075
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,920
well that can be quite high in Arsenic

1076
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,519
so you do have to be careful of your

1077
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,240
source and then lastly is crystallin so

1078
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,440
that's silicon dioxide those are things

1079
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:17,358
like

1080
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,280
um salt or quartz for example not salt

1081
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:22,719
sorry sand or quartz um that that's that

1082
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,119
crystallin form and those are going to

1083
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,558
be available more on a period of weeks

1084
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,400
to months to years and probably are not

1085
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,119
even going to be available that first or

1086
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,920
second cycle even um so if you're adding

1087
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:38,000
silica sand keep in mind that these

1088
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,280
products are rare rarely

1089
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,639
unavailable um one exception to this

1090
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,599
would be dious Earth according to Dr

1091
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,759
zelner uh it tends to be fairly

1092
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,240
available to the plant and they've done

1093
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,119
some research with that which I think is

1094
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,118
really

1095
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,079
interesting um and then this chart here

1096
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,800
that she shared with us is a good way to

1097
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,280
compare SI products so you can convert

1098
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,079
them so you actually are comparing

1099
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,400
Apples to Apples because it is quite

1100
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,640
confusing and all these different forms

1101
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,400
of

1102
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:09,920
Si um will offer different levels of

1103
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,838
actual

1104
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,559
silicone and then if you are applying it

1105
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:20,239
she recommends 30 to 60 PPM weekly or 20

1106
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,240
to 40 PPM on a soil

1107
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,239
test all right and that is the talk

1108
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,280
really appreciate you guys checking it

1109
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:29,598
out if you do have questions comment and

1110
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,519
I'll do my best to answer them or uh

1111
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,240
send me an email at Tad atkiss

1112
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,920
organics.com and I really appreciate you

1113
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,959
guys checking out and supporting the

1114
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,760
podcast we do have a patreon channel for

1115
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,280
anyone that is interested that uh allows

1116
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,680
you access to the

1117
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,440
podcasts immediately after I record them

1118
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,558
you get the raw interviews with all the

1119
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,280
information uh we also do monthly

1120
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,960
Hangouts uh where we share our grows and

1121
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,880
talk talk with other Growers um about

1122
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,920
what's going on not just in our grows

1123
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,920
but in our lives and then also do a book

1124
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,838
club right now we're working our way

1125
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,559
through teaming with microbes we already

1126
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,318
did the intelligent Gardener and we have

1127
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:09,760
a few more books on Deck uh so it's been

1128
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,318
a lot of fun oh and then we also have a

1129
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,200
private Discord Channel and some other

1130
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:15,558
stuff going on but um yeah so if you

1131
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:17,318
like the podcast and you want to support

1132
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:18,839
it it's a really easy way to do it I

1133
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:20,199
think it's as low as five bucks a month

1134
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,239
you can check it out and get access to

1135
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:26,719
all that stuff too so appreciate your

1136
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,719
support have a great day
