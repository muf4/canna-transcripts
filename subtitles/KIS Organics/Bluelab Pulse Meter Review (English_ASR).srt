1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,080
this is the blue lab pulse meter I'm

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,040
very excited to be able to add it to our

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,000
lineup of products at kiss Organics and

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,160
we have the best price online this meter

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,118
is not for everyone but here's what it

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,640
does it measures moisture conductivity

7
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:21,000
or EC and temperature directly in the

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,560
root Zone with one click it connects to

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,518
the blue lab Pulse app to view analyze

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,038
and store all your measurement data the

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,479
apps available in English Spanish Dutch

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,359
German and Korean and it has a has a

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,520
built-in depth gauge to get consistent

14
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:40,479
measurements with every reading it works

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,079
in soil Coco core nutrient solution and

16
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,238
living soils so how and why would you

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,399
want something like this for your garden

18
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,038
well first off it will quickly measure

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,759
moisture levels it is waterproof unlike

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,320
the blue mat moisture meter and I love

21
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,039
that I can get a reading immediately

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,439
instead of having to wait for a while

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,519
between readings this means I can use

24
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,238
one meter and check multiple pots or

25
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,280
beds in in a matter of seconds to see

26
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,079
how evenly I'm watering or if I have any

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,118
dry spots or if any containers got

28
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:11,200
missed when watering secondly it tells

29
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,840
me EC EC is a measurement of electrical

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
conductivity in your soil which is a

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,159
good way of seeing what level of

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,719
fertility you have in your media cat

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,118
like calcium magnesium potassium sodium

34
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,640
and ammonium as well as annion like

35
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,879
sulfur chloride nitrates and

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,560
bicarbonates are all salts that when

37
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,158
dissolved in solution and soils will

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,159
carry electrical charges and current now

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
too high of an EC will potentially put

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,320
osmotic pressure on your roots and that

41
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,039
can be bad so it's about getting it into

42
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,639
the proper range and we really want a

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,640
soil test so we can determine what is

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,960
making up the salt concentration in our

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,879
soil but it will give us a rough idea of

46
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,519
fertility in our soil mix if we know all

47
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:52,078
our inputs and staying within certain EC

48
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:54,078
ranges typically 7 to 2.8 will allow for

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,919
good microbial activity and important

50
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,078
soil processes like respiration and

51
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,280
decomposition keep in mind that several

52
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,758
factors canect effect soil EC such as

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,118
moisture content soil structure and the

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,560
presence of dissolved salts as the soil

55
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,840
moisture increases so will your

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
EC and lastly I get an idea of

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,120
temperature cold root Zone temperatures

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,719
can inhibit plant growth and the uptake

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,080
of many essential nutrients like

60
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,840
phosphorus and too high of soil temps

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,160
can make it easier for plant pathogens

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,878
to grow I'm currently calibrating it

63
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,840
with my blue matat moisture meter and

64
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,079
we'll be comparing it with an aerometer

65
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,080
here soon

66
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,519
okay so this is the iPhone app that

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,959
comes along with it you can use it on

68
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,200
Android as well though the app is called

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,158
pulse again it's available in multiple

70
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,959
languages and essentially I just push

71
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,759
the button on the pulse meter itself to

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,640
connect it it connects quickly via

73
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,039
Bluetooth and then at that point I don't

74
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,919
have to keep reconnecting with every

75
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,840
calibration or every every photo I want

76
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,839
to take I just click the measure button

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
and then I can go in as I'm doing here

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,280
and I can add a photo to that

79
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,079
measurement as well as any notes that I

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,719
may want so here's a good place I can

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,799
add say the the VPD in the room at the

82
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,158
time um any pest pressures I may dealing

83
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,959
with uh when I watered um and and keep

84
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,679
track of all of that right here in the

85
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,560
app so it's a nice little kind of like

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,560
journal in some ways now this could get

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,280
complicated in a facility where you have

88
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,959
multiple plants and things like that but

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
you do have the ability to export the

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,719
data so if you had a facility for

91
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,479
example you could just measure one room

92
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,479
export that data and then keep the files

93
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,518
somewhere else associated with it but

94
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,079
since I just have using it in this room

95
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,000
I can go back through historically and

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,519
look at my notes and anytime you see an

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,878
orange dot there next to the recording

98
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,080
that tells me that I took a picture um

99
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,000
or added extra notes so that's a really

100
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,000
handy feature to quickly go back through

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,158
and look at what was going on in the

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,519
room at that time for tracking things so

103
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,359
again not for everyone but if you're

104
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,239
into Data this is a really cool tool

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
that uh could potentially help you in

106
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,519
your growth

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,319
and so you can see what I was doing here

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,840
was I was comparing the 35% moisture in

109
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,438
this case correlated approximately with

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,360
my blue matte moisture meter um at that

111
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,238
point it said I was at about 75 M bar

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,680
now I've been playing around with this

113
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,279
for a little while and getting a bunch

114
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,600
of measurements to kind of get an idea

115
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,359
of EC and uh moisture level and how

116
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
those things relate to say something

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,319
like the blue matat moisture meter and I

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,439
find I probably want to be around 35 to

119
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:36,478
45 5% is a moisture range um and that

120
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:41,038
probably correlates to about 80 let's

121
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,560
say 70 to 90 in terms of uh mbar ratings

122
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,839
but one other cool feature here I can

123
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,000
now export this data I can send it to

124
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:52,519
someone or I can save it to a file or

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,439
email it to myself and uh I think that's

126
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,519
another really great feature associated

127
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,120
with this you can configure it based on

128
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,038
the type of media you're using in this

129
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,240
case I just configured it to a mix media

130
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:03,839
for living

131
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,680
soil well that's it that's the blue lab

132
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,478
pulse meter I hope I covered the pros

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,439
and cons as well as why someone might

134
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,038
want to use this tool in their Garden

135
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,120
thanks for checking out my review and

136
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:19,199
you can go to kis organics.com to learn

137
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,199
