Hussey of kiss organics this is the

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,599
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,608
edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,469
science-based perspective and draw on

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,510
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:31,219

in the industry to the show also sign up

18
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,709
for our newsletters on our website I'm

19
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,659
going to be releasing a compost tea

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,070
white paper and a bunch of new content

21
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,809
here in the next few weeks and it's the

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,659
best way to find out right away when new

23
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,640
episodes come out this is part 3 in our

24
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:00,799
series with Jim Bennett also known as

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,960
Clackamas coot on such forums as I see

26
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,878
Meg and lumper dogs on grass City

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,530
he's an organic grower and gardener who

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,730
has helped many people in improving the

29
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,820
way they garden and move away from

30
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,740
bottle of nutrients now before we get

31
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:14,299
into the interview with coot I wanted to

32
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,890
take a moment to address something I've

33
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,959
been hearing about for the past month or

34
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,579
so there are some self-proclaimed

35
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,500
cannabis consultants out there that

36
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,329
worked with dr. Ingham and have a series

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,700
of biological tests where they applied a

38
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:27,829
neem seed meal or neem cake tea to the

39
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,840
soil and they claimed it affected the

40
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:32,060
bacterial fungal racial of the soil in a

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,700
negative manner allowing an increase in

42
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,680
disease-causing microorganisms they also

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,990
claimed it kills beneficial fungi and

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,909
nematodes while increasing ciliates I've

45
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,920
heard growers are literally throwing out

46
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,630
their soil over this and to me that is

47
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,790
just crazy and I wanted to address it

48
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:48,879
here's what I would say in response and

49
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,800
then I'll have coot comment as well

50
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,658
first off I've done microscope testing

51
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,759
on neem cake and aerated compost teas

52
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,200
that information is freely available on

53
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,969
YouTube and I've added it right on the

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,130
podcast page so anyone can take a look

55
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:03,319
for themselves the person in question

56
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:05,329
did not use a high-quality neem cake for

57
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,919
the test the products that we use and

58
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,389
carry are of the highest quality and we

59
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,300
did a lot of research before bringing

60
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,129
them in we never recommend making an

61
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,700
anaerobic tea with neem and kelp and

62
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,039
full-power

63
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,988
the ways we wreck

64
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,929
name cake is to add it to your worm bin

65
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,819
mix it into your soil mix or aerate it

66
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,519
and use it as a soil drench to combat

67
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:26,229
fungus gnats anaerobic teas are always

68
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,849
going to be high in bacteria and

69
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,768
ciliates that's common knowledge in the

70
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,840
compost tea industry and widely

71
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:34,209
maintained dissolved oxygen and aerated

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,030
compost teas above six milligrams per

73
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:39,158
liter for the entire brew cycle these

74
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,780
tests are only from one individual that

75
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:43,239
have not been replicated by anyone else

76
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,009
based on this fact alone I wouldn't draw

77
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,599
any conclusions and the fact he is

78
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,639
having people threw out perfectly good

79
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,500
soil an attempt to make neem into this

80
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,078
catastrophic soil amendment is just

81
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,068
ridiculous I believe this individual is

82
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,629
just trying to make a name for

83
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:57,189
themselves so they can get consulting

84
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:58,689
work by attacking someone like who they

85
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:00,759
didn't even isolate for a controlling

86
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:03,250
variable meaning they makes neem cake

87
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,169
kelp and fulvic acid based on that one

88
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,030
could just this easily conclude that it

89
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,649
was the kelp or the fulvic acid or

90
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,750
something else caused by the combination

91
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,219
of ingredients there's no way you can

92
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,919
clued that neem had a negative effect

93
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:16,959
based on that alone and just because

94
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,638
someone shows you a soil test or a lab

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,620
test doesn't mean that it's real science

96
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,060
when I first heard about this because

97
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,340
people were sending me messages on

98
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,590
Instagram I went over to the guy's page

99
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,419
and took a look I posted my YouTube

100
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,949
microscope link as a way of sharing more

101
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,780
information and to hopefully start a

102
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,400
discussion at that point I was really

103
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,739
interested in seeing if his claims were

104
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,629
true and learning more instead he

105
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,150
promptly blocked me and deleted my post

106
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:41,888
then in private messages he told me I'm

107
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,739
just the bizarre old man and to go

108
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:47,079
hassle other kids now first off I don't

109
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,878
think I'm that old I mean yes I do turn

110
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,260
40 in a couple of weeks and my knees are

111
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,870
starting to feel like they belong on a

112
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:54,878
60 year old but in all seriousness no

113
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,799
legitimate researcher would delete data

114
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,870
or not welcome an open discussion I

115
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,790
found it really telling that he was more

116
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,340
interested in controlling the dialogue

117
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:04,959
around the discussion and neem than

118
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,549
actually working together towards a

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,870
greater understanding which is what

120
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,629
science is really all about

121
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,669
as far as I'm concerned based on what

122
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:14,768
I've read so far I'm throwing this into

123
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,199
the category of fake news as the

124
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,819
politicians or media might say that is

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,009
at least until we can get more data to

126
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:22,120
support anything he is saying keep in

127
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,098
mind that name has been used for

128
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,098
literally thousands of years by farmers

129
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:28,569
as a means of improving their soil all I

130
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:30,610
see here are some lab

131
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,550
us with no controlling variable a low

132
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,080
sample size poorly sourced inputs to

133
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,490
which this so-called consultant has

134
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,050
drawn conclusions that just aren't

135
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,809
proven and go against all the other

136
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,309
existing research lastly let's not

137
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:44,319
forget that the plant can control the

138
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:47,050
microbial population in the rhizosphere

139
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,908
based on the exudates it puts out and

140
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,579
cannabis appears to prefer bacterial

141
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:52,300
soils like other annual crops but I've

142
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,769
talked enough

143
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,418
let's get coot on here and see what he

144
00:04:53,769 --> 00:05:02,128
has to say hey there

145
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:05,049
thank you what Ted I appreciate it I

146
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:07,180
didn't read the gentlemen because he

147
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,348
blocked me several months ago because he

148
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:15,249
did a bogus test on this so-called

149
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:18,418
Koontz mix so the science out of that

150
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:20,919
individual for me is incomplete and

151
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:24,838
generally inflammatory and again trying

152
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:28,868
to promote some kind of an agenda for

153
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:33,329
consulting work but let me clarify one

154
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:37,180
thing the neem tree as a part of human

155
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:41,258
health goes back at least 12,000 years

156
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,199
and all parts of the tree are used in

157
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,749
different ways of course the bark the

158
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:52,439
leaves the berries and the roots and

159
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:55,659
then of course the oil and meals as a

160
00:05:52,439 --> 00:06:00,669
crop amendment it picks up at about

161
00:05:55,658 --> 00:06:02,769
8,000 years ago and in the 90s you

162
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:06,368
remember this I mean at least reading

163
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:10,749
about it W our grace tried to grab

164
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:12,789
control of the International neem market

165
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:16,300
and it isn't just India that produces

166
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:19,949
neem oil and meals and the case went all

167
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,028
the way to the world court at the hague

168
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,788
after spending eight hundred million

169
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:27,069
dollars because of the work of dr.

170
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:30,490
vedanta shiva which you know is behind

171
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:35,110
the dirt movie titled dirt she's the one

172
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:39,218
that led the cause and w our grace

173
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,720
wasn't successful leave it at that I've

174
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:44,889
read too

175
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,370
these are academic books NIEM a treatise

176
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,659
which is for PhDs

177
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,240
they're the actual authors course they

178
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,680
reference a body of work that goes back

179
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:01,189
to the 1800s as far as science and then

180
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,870
the big one is the name tree which was I

181
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,810
can't try to pronounce his worry it's

182
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:09,350
German but he arrived in the Sudan after

183
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,980
graduating from Cologne University as an

184
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:15,560
entomologist because there was a locusts

185
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,960
disaster going on in the Sudan and so in

186
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,990
an arrive he noticed that the neem trees

187
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:26,409
weren't affected by the locusts so he

188
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,710
spent the next 35 years studying name

189
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:33,439
finishing up in 1993 and then put his

190
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:37,039
research together in this book the need

191
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:41,350
the name tree and also references over

192
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,900
500 scientist and 200 research

193
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,560
institution and then something like 20

194
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:50,899
governments and their body of research

195
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,689
going back like I said to the 1800s and

196
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:56,929
then more recent research that he and

197
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:59,329
other contemporaries were involved at a

198
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:04,220
number of institutions and research

199
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:07,849
organizations the neem tree is found in

200
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,620
over 72% of re-reading preparations and

201
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,530
at that I really don't have much more to

202
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,569
say I mean any of us who have used neem

203
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,179
and I've probably one of the original in

204
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,490
this discussion going back at least what

205
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,759
12 years because when you and I met I

206
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,918
was already firmly established using me

207
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:29,870
land oil and then picked up karanji

208
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:33,588
around the same time and you've seen my

209
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,269
work online and in private photos I've

210
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,880
sent you do you think I'm there

211
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:39,468
something missing here no Jim I mean

212
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,599
your plants always look really nice and

213
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,700
haven't you also been in contact with a

214
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,940
lot of other growers over the years who

215
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,640
have been using neem as well yes and I

216
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,480
would even venture to say well I'll just

217
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,480
leave it at unders

218
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,580
alright enough on that subject let's get

219
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:01,659
back into our interview with Clackamas

220
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:04,210
coot talking about seaweed and kelp if

221
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:10,919
you want to really know about kill dr.

222
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:13,660
Michael Geary GUI ry who's a Irish

223
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:17,529
seasoned consider one we met first in

224
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:21,939
the world on marine algae his website is

225
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:25,059
seaweed ie which is Ireland and if you

226
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,460
hit the nutrition tab on the menu he

227
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:30,039
compares the three types of marine algae

228
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,129
there's red green and brown the one we

229
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,689
want is brown you mentioned the one that

230
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:37,809
comes out of North Atlantic on the west

231
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,240
coast it's not as harvested and I

232
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:42,189
wouldn't use it because the sheer amount

233
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,639
of traffic shipped the shipping lanes

234
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,020
out of Asia but lemon era Digita WA

235
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,669
bladderwrack

236
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:54,189
if you will the ones that create the

237
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:57,659
kelp forests they're really critical to

238
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:02,170
marine mammals for high-end young row

239
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:04,360
hiding places from being eat brown kelp

240
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:07,559
produces some compounds that are not

241
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,590
found in any other plant on this earth

242
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:13,719
the big one is all genic acid and within

243
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:17,019
the last 48 hours you've probably taken

244
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,870
some parma alginic acid at least five

245
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,360
different ways and that's a whole nother

246
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,600
reason it's really fascinating how

247
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,060
much--how alginic acid is used but these

248
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,159
are compounds that you can't replace and

249
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,219
we can replace nitrogen in number of

250
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,269
ways like you mentioned you got comfrey

251
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,850
alfalfa I mean there's a lot of things

252
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,679
that have over levels of nitrogen but

253
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,080
things like alginic acid and through

254
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,939
Kotian and some other compounds those

255
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,460
only exist and you can see the

256
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,780
side-by-side comparison of the three

257
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,710
varieties of marine algae

258
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,620
groups I don't know whatever you want to

259
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,810
call red green and brown Browns the one

260
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,970
we want and the red one is the one that

261
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:00,819
has the collagen this used as a

262
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:06,570
thickening agent as you discovered on

263
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,370
the ridding process so that one

264
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:12,930
I don't know that we'd want to use that

265
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:14,909
in our soils and green well you can see

266
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,289
for yourself the the side by side is

267
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:19,110
really fascinating he's got some

268
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:21,089
incredible photos and he's written three

269
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,279
or four books on marine algae around the

270
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,019
world so if somebody really wanted to

271
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,850
learn about kelp that would be a good

272
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,120
resource without buying a book because

273
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:34,080
it's a his the library repository is

274
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,909
extensive and complete so Jim just to

275
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,200
change directions really quick I would I

276
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:40,139
would love to have you back on the show

277
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,670
at some point but one thing I wanted to

278
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,100
I thought listeners might really enjoy

279
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:47,849
would be a little bit of your history in

280
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,139
regards to the one in that story oh I

281
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,659
don't know if any if anyone's actually

282
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,449
heard you tell that in an audio version

283
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:57,029
well it was not it was not okay the one

284
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,160
came about it was a stupid it was a joke

285
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:02,159
there came a time that I needed money

286
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:05,159
the indoor thing was just really getting

287
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,559
going and I lived in Laguna Beach for

288
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,480
many years at during the day hey days of

289
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,819
the Brotherhood of eternal love what

290
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,850
Nixon called the hippie mafia they were

291
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,620
responsible for green and honey's that

292
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,149
you probably are your listeners wouldn't

293
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,009
believe but this is one of those times

294
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,809
where government officials probably told

295
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:25,830
the truth and they were also the ones

296
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:28,139
that marketed the psychedelic orange

297
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,790
sunshine but anyway I have seeds my

298
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,620
first seed and I know it was going to do

299
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:34,889
I wasn't a grower I was only 19 years

300
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,649
old I got some seeds from Kandahar

301
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:39,480
Afghanistan right before I got drafted I

302
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,370
was hiding under the bed screaming no

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,230
send the women and children first yeah

304
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,570
anyway I had to go up to save the world

305
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,490
for democracy or something and then it

306
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,960
was 40 years ago this past Christmas the

307
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:54,149
first load of Thai sticks came in and so

308
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,879
that summer 40 years ago this summer I

309
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,980
did my first grow well we did there was

310
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,309
several of us and sensing me it wasn't

311
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,399
even what what's that so this was the

312
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,959
old cell man plant him and I didn't know

313
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,819
anything about newts I don't know any

314
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,790
share the word news even miracle girl

315
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:15,120
but I knew he had to water him and we

316
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:15,779
had a well so anyway we made some stupid

317
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,840
money

318
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,569
and a few years later in 84 this group

319
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,790
of

320
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,370
he wills that I hung with they wanted to

321
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:26,709
get involved in this growing so one of

322
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,200
them had uncle or a grandfather

323
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,990
something like that that had some

324
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,500
greenhouses so we took the Kandahar

325
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,659
seeds and we did an open pollination to

326
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,470
get a good genetic base to work from and

327
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:44,799
the same with these IPL's now Thai seeds

328
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:47,170
from these the first high sticks so

329
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,870
anyway long story short we will did I

330
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:52,990
whittled it down to ten plants and they

331
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:55,750
came over my house that day and this was

332
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,909
a you know a goodbye party they have a

333
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,429
good life please don't call me kind of

334
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:04,089
thing so I had the plants arranged

335
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:06,699
against the wall and my den the most

336
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,100
ateva to the most the one I had the most

337
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:13,240
indica expressions and since I had done

338
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,480
all the legwork I grabbed the most ateva

339
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,639
and I said the one here this one's mine

340
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,100
so somebody made a joke right oh so you

341
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,199
got like the one is it like and so

342
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,389
anyway there's a joke I mean dit the one

343
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,090
not that Oh like you know this is like

344
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,980
the best in the world ain't like that

345
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:32,080
well I made a mistake of writing about

346
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,909
that on Icee mag one I know a sudden oh

347
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,009
yeah the one mil and get the one yeah

348
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:37,809
it's a good plan but you know I just I

349
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,819
just kept it around because I had better

350
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:42,009
things to do then I only bought seeds

351
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,550
one time in my life and that's all I

352
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,370
needed

353
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,709
okay to see that where this was gonna go

354
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,019
and that was 30 years ago I bought him

355
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,060
from Neville the Hayes Northern Lights I

356
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,340
remembered being in Laguna there were

357
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:56,259
loads coming in from all around the

358
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,379
world these guys were real criminals

359
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,909
this wasn't oh yeah you says we're

360
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,100
talking about you know container loads

361
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:05,860
of hash if you can imagine that

362
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,230
containers there's a good book called

363
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:12,190
orange sunshine the story the hippie

364
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,750
mafia you can find it online Xers had

365
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:18,250
appeared in the Orange County Register

366
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,500
and these guys are crazy I mean they

367
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,820
once rented a helicopter in conjunction

368
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,629
with the Black Panthers and yank Timothy

369
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,860
Leary out of federal prison up in Lompoc

370
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:31,509
north of Santa Barbara can you imagine

371
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,399
that I mean that's kind of money they

372
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:35,289
had it was in

373
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,329
so anyway that's how the one came about

374
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:41,379
so all it is it's a Kandahar male and

375
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:43,930
then a tai chi stick sativa and this was

376
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:46,389
the most sativa that I could find out of

377
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,469
this because we started out by the time

378
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,509
we were ready to start really

379
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,779
investigating we had a hundred sativa

380
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:55,720
plants and a hundred of the type land

381
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,799
and we whittled it down to ten and I got

382
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,870
this when there was another one called

383
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,120
blue Orca I didn't name any of these

384
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,370
these were all named by the respected

385
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,220
most of which I never saw again there

386
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,110
was a magic crystals there was Mary

387
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,600
Poppins you know how kids are these

388
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,009
names stuff really stupid you know so

389
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,830
anyway that's how I got stuck with the

390
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:17,259
one and what's funny is is that by

391
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,840
today's standard because you know we now

392
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,159
breed for size right that's the bigger

393
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,560
doesn't matter what it is you know

394
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,000
tomatoes it's all about size right

395
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:29,049
forget flavor who cares

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,700
sure yield so yeah you know what drives

397
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:33,129
everything because consumers don't care

398
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,440
what they buy in the grocery store in

399
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,120
caught that called Tomatoes so as far as

400
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,640
a commercial plant I wouldn't recommend

401
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,529
it because I couldn't handle the crime

402
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,319
in the whiny well you know I only got

403
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:46,600
you know fill in the blank and for me

404
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,140
this wasn't a lifestyle change I had a

405
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,450
you know a daughter to raise I had other

406
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:55,480
things in my life going on but just

407
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,700
growing some plants under a light was

408
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,759
for my own personal use now there's a

409
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,470
guy here in Oregon he just took a plant

410
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,240
named it the one and they've got

411
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,970
t-shirts and keychains

412
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,370
I mean he's dancing and you know the

413
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,890
things a joke I didn't do this cuz I

414
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:14,529
didn't care but one of my friends that

415
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,560
on Instagram he used to be known as cool

416
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:20,410
cush he had it tested and posted from

417
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:24,399
the one of the labs here in Portland and

418
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:27,820
he had to take it down at 63 days and I

419
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,410
usually recommend 84 so that's another

420
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,169
reason people oh that's to honor you

421
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,840
know who I'm not gonna wait you know

422
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:38,740
twelve weeks but even at 63 days he

423
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:40,990
rolled in at almost 27 percent THC and I

424
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:46,000
know that if you took it to how long I

425
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,230
would do my records 18 weeks but even at

426
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,329
12 I know it would be over

427
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,769
thirty I mean I hear people around the

428
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,918
trade here that they're talking about

429
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:57,220
selling stuff to dispensary that's 2122

430
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,049
that seems kind of weak to me I mean I

431
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,240
want to feel like you know somebody hit

432
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:03,460
me in the my forehead with a fist like

433
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,400
Mike Tyson you know when I smoke I don't

434
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,110
want to it's not about really make some

435
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,150
people angry but I don't want like high

436
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:12,219
school weed you know it's stuff you know

437
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:15,548
it makes you giggle you know that's

438
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,950
let's get some THC rollin here

439
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:20,918
you know I mean well I know some people

440
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,039
who have taken that plant that you've

441
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:27,280
shared freely with a lot of people and I

442
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:29,168
know Bill took it like 70 or 80 days

443
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,058
once and he just said it was it was a

444
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:33,940
little too strong for him personally oh

445
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:36,759
yeah I've never heard anyone who's ever

446
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,679
tried the one ever complain about the

447
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:41,140
quality or the flavor or any of the

448
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,179
effects it seems like you have a pretty

449
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,130
amazing plant there on your hand hey you

450
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,110
know it's called see I don't call myself

451
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,600
a breeder because I have some integrity

452
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,889
and I would hope that other people who

453
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,649
call it do call themselves breeders

454
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,540
might want to take that advice you know

455
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,780
to be a breeder means you're a

456
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:01,928
geneticist and just because you took

457
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:04,178
Bob's cush and crossed it with Harry's

458
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:05,590
Hays doesn't make you a breeder just

459
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,669
makes you you know you're just throwing

460
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:08,589
crap against the wall and see what

461
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,110
sticks and I'll be the first to admit

462
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:13,750
man this whole thing was with the luck

463
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:15,308
of the draw hello TD I've never made a

464
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,190
claim that I'm some great breeder I'm

465
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:20,019
not but hey you know it's better than

466
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,169
the crap I bought from a Neville I can

467
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:25,298
tell you that I was shocked shocked cuz

468
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:27,690
remember in Laguna Beach at that time

469
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:31,929
you can find people that have seeds from

470
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,730
India Sri Lanka the really good soha

471
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:35,910
kurd infected talking with tim wilson

472
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:40,750
one time about a hawk and spears circa

473
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:43,840
1978 77 the stuff of legends true

474
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,579
lambsbread now kids just grab a name and

475
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,668
go here we're gonna call it this okay

476
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:50,529
I've asked these hash cush extras that

477
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:53,320
we've been at the cush Valley well know

478
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:56,019
so you really have no idea what this is

479
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,789
right well no okay but it sounds cool

480
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:59,230
how can you how can you not like

481
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:01,418
something you know sounds really exotic

482
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,628
there's definitely a lot of

483
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:06,669
hyperbole yad myth and and it's really

484
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:09,819
hard because this was a essentially a

485
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:11,740
illegal plant for so long that finding

486
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:13,538
out the actual history of it is really

487
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,028
really tough when we talk about genetics

488
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:19,089
so that i think that is a challenge it

489
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:21,819
is and you know i to me it doesn't

490
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:24,009
matter you know if if people feel better

491
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:27,369
about themselves because they grow them

492
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,028
dumb you know cush hey how about it i

493
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:30,339
don't care

494
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:33,460
but it says they're not gonna impress me

495
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:36,158
and i always ask well how good is the

496
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:39,129
weed and that to a person okay when the

497
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,450
whole cush thing got started really big

498
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:44,199
there were three of them this was like

499
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,990
circa 2005 2006 something like that and

500
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,610
so I got a card not because I needed

501
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,278
permission from the state of Oregon to

502
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:54,069
grow weed but I wanted access to these

503
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:56,288
after you get a card groups because you

504
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:58,089
could freely exchange you know meeting

505
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,579
because it was legal you could exchange

506
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:02,199
cuts and seeds or whatever so I went on

507
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,058
this campaign to find all these strains

508
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,519
that I'd been reading about that I was

509
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:08,440
just a fool because I wasn't growing and

510
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,210
most of never made it past a twenty

511
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,249
eight lot him didn't make it past a

512
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,528
twenty-one to like I mean I've been gone

513
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:16,179
for 40 years I kind of knew where this

514
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:17,679
was going right I mean I don't have to

515
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:20,649
finish a plant to see if I want to keep

516
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,899
it and it was unbelievable I mean once

517
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:24,368
one plant in particular and everybody

518
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:26,018
I've talked to has agreed with me I

519
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:27,788
won't even name it cuz it doesn't matter

520
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,859
I said have you ever used that many

521
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:32,259
bamboo sticks on any other string and

522
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:33,998
they all start laughs ago never I'm not

523
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,798
joking I mean I'll bet you I had ten

524
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:38,409
this isn't a ten gallon pot I bet you I

525
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:40,298
had to use ten bamboo stakes with zip

526
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,249
ties to hold the thing up well that is

527
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:44,168
in genetics that's just selling us and

528
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:45,788
one string that's really popular with it

529
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,970
when it first showed up but I see mag a

530
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:50,888
few years ago I seriously seriously

531
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,169
thought it was a joke article from the

532
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:55,148
onion I mean this structure was that bad

533
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:58,149
and yet it became a cottage industry

534
00:21:55,148 --> 00:22:00,248
with several derivatives I just I don't

535
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:03,099
know I mean there's as much marketing

536
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:04,899
around cultivars now as there is around

537
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:08,079
bottled nutrients of course there's

538
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:11,288
growing so yeah I will freely give any

539
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:13,720
gimmick I have away but you got to be in

540
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,919
front of me cuz I'm not sending it and I

541
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,108
ain't driving it anywhere

542
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,528
but in Oregon I can legally give anybody

543
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:23,849
plant material and be in compliance with

544
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:26,378
the law both medical laws as well as the

545
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:28,238
recreational laws they implemented see I

546
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:31,689
don't he knew not everybody might know

547
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:33,519
this but Oregon when they decided we

548
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,200
already had we were one of the early not

549
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,470
first but one of the earlier states they

550
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,330
have a medical plan like II think goes

551
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,730
back like 20 years and then the

552
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:46,480
recreational thing after some stumbling

553
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:48,489
came into be recently and last year or

554
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,409
two whatever well any household not

555
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:53,019
person but household any household can

556
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:57,580
grow for plants so it's really changed

557
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:59,829
the dynamic here in that regard and so I

558
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:03,519
I showed you those pictures the other

559
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:07,449
day of using the rockwool cubes with my

560
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,069
formula and I always have more cuts and

561
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,369
I can possibly use and I give them away

562
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:14,079
it's not a big deal I mean you still

563
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:16,749
gotta have if you want a girl you gotta

564
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,128
have good soil and I guarantee you that

565
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:20,079
ninety percent of the people that take

566
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:21,849
them wouldn't even know what that term

567
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,230
means so yeah and they're gonna be

568
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,849
disappointed and that's okay

569
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,679
you wanted it here it is you know I

570
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:29,168
can't grow a good tomato plants in

571
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,028
Miracle Grow so I'm not even gonna try

572
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:33,700
with other plants that's just kind of

573
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:35,888
the way I am I like I plus I like

574
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,028
controlled like you said you want to

575
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:38,709
know what's in a product that you're

576
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:43,749
gonna use well I'm the same way about my

577
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:47,319
soil because I mix it myself and I don't

578
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:49,899
deviate I use the same materials in the

579
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:52,148
same proportions and that way I get

580
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:53,589
consistent results and that's also how

581
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:55,658
you're able to test all of these other

582
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:57,308
products because right you only have

583
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,619
changing one thing at a time and you

584
00:23:57,308 --> 00:24:02,378
know this plant so intimately from

585
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:03,428
growing it for 40 years yeah now I do

586
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:06,038
have a daughter

587
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:09,609
another type plant from that era

588
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:12,099
actually I got this one in 86 a 4th of

589
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:14,319
July party with a friend rest in peace

590
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:17,709
we used to call him OPH our personal

591
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:20,798
hero and mr. cool and he had this party

592
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:24,278
every year and so this was some guys

593
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:26,168
that were in the seed as group of the

594
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,089
Brotherhood and they did a lot of

595
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,600
business with you might have heard about

596
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:30,279
it where

597
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,879
you live to Oregon and Washington the

598
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,440
sacred seeds and then the consortium out

599
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,030
of California anyway they were supplying

600
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,059
seeds and so he brought these seeds back

601
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:41,289
he goes this is the velvet rush and he

602
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,849
didn't know anything about it so I

603
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:46,869
planted it and I went yeah that's a Thai

604
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:49,149
plan and so anyway we crossed the I had

605
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:50,739
a friend in Hawaii because this is not

606
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,590
the best area the country to produce

607
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,079
seeds because there are weather patterns

608
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:58,659
you want to see mold do a seed plant so

609
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:02,409
he crossed the velvet rush with the one

610
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:05,560
and the problem is that I showed you

611
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:08,110
some pictures of those giant plants well

612
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:10,539
that's not what most people need but one

613
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:13,659
of the people that gave those seeds to

614
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:16,659
found one that's really manageable and

615
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,460
we call it AG dis cut and I think that's

616
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,070
the name of my dog I think I sent some

617
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:23,650
photos to you but this thing is just

618
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:26,309
it's got the mass of the velvet rush but

619
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,440
it has the resin set of the TE oh and

620
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,240
this is my first run with it and I got

621
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,580
to tell you man it's just I'm almost

622
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:38,109
giddy I've never had a plant produced

623
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:40,720
like this and and I ran into Brad March

624
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:43,779
from March biological and I bought some

625
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,980
green lace wings and sometimes

626
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:49,000
everything they're called you know

627
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:54,400
emerald listeners whatever talk about an

628
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,559
effective pesticide geez decimated and

629
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,269
the advantages because you're dealing

630
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,789
with the larvae they don't leave like

631
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:03,180
ladybugs do for others because their

632
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:05,950
adults are mobile these aren't mobile

633
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,160
and it takes about three weeks till they

634
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:11,740
mature and you get enough for six plants

635
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,269
for eleven dollars I mean would you

636
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,160
spend eleven dollars every three weeks

637
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,569
take care of six plants and a personal

638
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,120
garden of course you would

639
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:21,129
no spraying nothing that's great I

640
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,899
didn't you know I was always a doubt

641
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,480
excited you know over the years I've

642
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,100
tried indoor and outdoor ladybugs and

643
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,259
like who doesn't like ladybugs and

644
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:32,529
you're pretty right but as far as the

645
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:35,829
stick around creditor you're worthless

646
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:37,960
I mean outdoors boom they're off to a

647
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:40,899
new adventure in a couple of days where

648
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,750
these the larvae they can't fly yet they

649
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,400
not only eat

650
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,700
organisms eat their eggs which is really

651
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,320
exciting so you're breaking the you

652
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,180
can't use them outdoors if it gets cold

653
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,369
the holidays in the northwest what three

654
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,009
weeks ago we had temperatures down in

655
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:59,799
the 30s so you know you got to reapply

656
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:03,490
or when it warms up if I say the end of

657
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:05,889
June certainly I'm gonna be having these

658
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,809
tags hanging on all my tomatoes and

659
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,130
other plants one of the reasons the

660
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,679
problems here at where you and I live

661
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:14,200
west of the Cascades okay this has been

662
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,420
a big nursery area going back to the

663
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,509
1880s and you know you've been at the

664
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,789
big nurseries Monrovia and and hundreds

665
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:24,220
and hundreds of acres you talk about

666
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:26,440
mono cropping I mean we ever seen you

667
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,420
know 50 acres of arbor vitae it's really

668
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,220
depressing

669
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,440
that you would sell that many right so

670
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,620
around the world there's like 38 hundred

671
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,950
species of powdery mildew and in a study

672
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:42,459
by OSU in conjunction with UWF yollop

673
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:45,970
they identified almost 10% of the entire

674
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,410
world's total west of the Cascades so

675
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,850
you can see some of the challenges we're

676
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,470
up against and the reason for that is

677
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:52,299
that when you're in the nursery business

678
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,410
to stay in business you have to offer

679
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:58,539
your customers new plants right and new

680
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,070
plants come for worse somewhere else so

681
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:02,950
everybody comes along for the right

682
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:06,399
mites mildew you know I mean on and on

683
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:10,299
and on so we have challenges that you

684
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,009
probably wouldn't have say in Southern

685
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:13,750
California I mean you might have you had

686
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:16,019
of other problems like white flies but

687
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,339
you probably wouldn't have some of the

688
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,559
incredible levels of powdery mildew that

689
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:22,779
we deal with and that was what got me on

690
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,149
a neem is that it wasn't until I really

691
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:27,160
started studying how to use name

692
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,920
correctly and the emulsifying and all

693
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,080
the other things I can now say without

694
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,200
any caveats

695
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:38,259
I've been mold free for nine years and I

696
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,360
also practice IPM for some people IPM

697
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,730
means oh I saw some I better spray I

698
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:45,339
mean you got a spray every week that's

699
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,370
just the deal and you got to have good

700
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:51,399
soil because the plant itself can ward

701
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:53,289
off most diseases if you've given it the

702
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,080
tools and the tools are what we've been

703
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:58,509
talking about concrete kelp and Mike

704
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,069
a snoo meal for those that don't she's

705
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:02,169
used for whatever reasons but all those

706
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:04,898
things add to the dynamic and the

707
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:08,230
quality worm castings that consider this

708
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:13,148
the first like legitimate science

709
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:17,740
research of worms casts castings didn't

710
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:20,278
occur until 1974 in Germany so in many

711
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:25,630
ways we're really on the cutting edge of

712
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:30,579
what this entails and there's a book by

713
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:34,750
he spent 65 years has two doctorates one

714
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:37,418
from Oxford and one from Ohio State dr.

715
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,339
Edwards his book permaculture technology

716
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:41,679
is actually an anthology of about 30

717
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:44,829
articles from different writers around

718
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,919
the world and it was dr. Edwards that

719
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:50,319
developed the vertical flow through

720
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:53,169
which I had built Dan Holcomb it or

721
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,849
Oregon soil company he's the one that he

722
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:56,019
and dr. Edwards put their heads together

723
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:58,058
and built this

724
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,759
yes it's state of the art would I

725
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:03,220
recommend it no get a smart pot it's far

726
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,500
easier you got complete aeration you

727
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,419
don't have to feed it so much this week

728
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,159
because the idea is that you feed from

729
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:11,350
the top and harvest from the bottom it's

730
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,539
not the idea that's how it works so your

731
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:16,569
big producers like worm power in New

732
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:18,460
York they have all vertical but that's

733
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:19,658
you know you're talking millions and

734
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,419
millions and millions of dollars that

735
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:25,059
were invested in that Factory we're

736
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:27,090
trying to do some for like you said 200

737
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:30,278
yo that's a yard just think of everybody

738
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:32,888
set up a 200-gallon smart pot with some

739
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:35,109
quality you know material and added some

740
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:37,028
amendments that we've discussed and just

741
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:38,199
a couple pounds of worms I mean think

742
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:41,288
about what that would do to the

743
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,679
gardening dynamic of the tomatoes they

744
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:46,798
grew the flowers you know roses whatever

745
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,940
you like lilies whatever your thing is

746
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,769
there isn't a single plant that's not

747
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,100
going to benefit from the quality of the

748
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:56,048
worm castings and what makes worm

749
00:30:54,099 --> 00:31:00,339
castings different from thermophilic

750
00:30:56,048 --> 00:31:04,808
compost is that the vermiculture process

751
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:07,178
is driven in large part by enzymes the

752
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:09,609
worms not only have enzymes in their

753
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:09,970
digestive tract they also release them

754
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:14,229
from the

755
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:16,660
skins to trigger specific microbial

756
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,339
responses just like plants do I mean you

757
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,950
know more about this than I do but

758
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:26,139
plants release X's into the soil right

759
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:28,450
to trigger nutrient uptake or to you

760
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,660
know whatever instruction sets from the

761
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,090
brain center in the taproot plants have

762
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,279
to brain centers ones in the meristem

763
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:38,949
and the other ones in the taproot and

764
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,970
which is why topping a plant makes no

765
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,590
sense whatsoever

766
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,450
talk to anybody's ever topped a plant I

767
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:45,369
say if they're honest well yeah I lost

768
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,680
about ten days till I got back online

769
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:49,599
but you can bend it and you still create

770
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,210
the same hormone that you're wanting to

771
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,189
see to get lateral growth just those

772
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,110
little seek not secrets just those

773
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,400
little that comes from owning inertia

774
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:59,500
the last thing I would do is go out

775
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,960
there and you know be topping plants

776
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,250
I mean why there's one I can shooting

777
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,319
yourself in the foot another to take

778
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,940
your shoe and sock off to make sure it's

779
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,220
a good clean hit when you're trying to

780
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,890
grow Japanese maples that are gonna sell

781
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,620
retail for thirty five hundred four

782
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,130
thousand dollars why would you do stuff

783
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:17,919
like that

784
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,200
you wouldn't so don't talk your plants

785
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,160
tie them down I think the kids call it

786
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,830
LST low stress training okay as opposed

787
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,720
to super cropping you know when I first

788
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:32,500
got these weed words I had I had a

789
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:36,160
fellow there younger guy that helped in

790
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:40,660
real life so I'd sent him email okay so

791
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,730
what's LST or okay what's super cropping

792
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,220
the one that cracks me up to a see a

793
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,039
green okay the Chinese developed what

794
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,420
the kids call today see a green forty

795
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,750
five hundred years ago they were also

796
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:55,650
the first society to figure out routing

797
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,950
on a massive level routing a cutting

798
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:02,259
okay so that method was taken up by the

799
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:05,400
French and then it was called the French

800
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:08,470
technique and then Alan Chadwick a Brit

801
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:12,280
master organic gardening type fellow in

802
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:16,360
the fifties he called it the French not

803
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:18,160
biodynamic bio bio intensive yes thank

804
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:20,859
you thank you okay then one of his

805
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,830
students in the 70s late 60s in the

806
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:27,189
early 70s John Jevons at

807
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:29,769
the ecology Action Center he modified it

808
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,090
again and he wrote the book the titles

809
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:33,579
something like how to grow more

810
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:36,908
vegetables in the smallest amount of

811
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:41,019
land possible and it always raised beds

812
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:43,690
in five by 20 foot beds and you would

813
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:46,929
plant him really tight on center and

814
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:49,450
that would then reduce evaporation it

815
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:52,630
would also limit the ability for weeds

816
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,940
to get all those things right and so

817
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,950
it's fact that's where I first started

818
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,110
40 years ago I went to his school

819
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,769
week-long school in Northern California

820
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:05,319
and to learn biointensive

821
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:07,269
then in the late 80s some there was two

822
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:10,029
magazine one was High Times and another

823
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:12,550
one was from Tom Alexander who I I think

824
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:16,149
you've met he had one called sensimilla

825
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:18,460
tips and some Yahoo and Amsterdam's yeah

826
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:21,549
we got this new method Matt's called see

827
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,559
a green so I'm reading this you know I'm

828
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,800
going what do you mean you invented this

829
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:30,219
what are you talking about so anyway see

830
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,050
a green became well there's those weed

831
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:33,908
growers are really smart guys like me

832
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,000
because they stumbled on a document or a

833
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,440
manuscript out of China Thank You Juan

834
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,750
so they take credit for everything

835
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,059
they've done nothing you know kind of

836
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,398
thing but I practice at it like

837
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:48,039
especially with strawberries where you

838
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:50,138
want really healthy strawberries and you

839
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:51,309
know how strawberries are especially the

840
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,440
varieties that we grow here in the

841
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:55,329
northwest like down here we grow a lot

842
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,128
of Hood berries I forget the one that

843
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:59,559
you folks have that's real popular up in

844
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:01,348
the Seattle area but you know with

845
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,210
strawberries you want to keep a fairly

846
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:06,039
hydrated soil not sopping but you know

847
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,230
the roots do better

848
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,940
whereas tomatoes maybe wouldn't want

849
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,088
your saw at that level and by the

850
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,700
biointensive method of planning whatever

851
00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:18,579
it is on center you can it's easier to

852
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:21,189
maintain that you I have a copy of his

853
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:22,750
book in PDF if you want it john Jevons

854
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,210
on biointensive it's really fascinating

855
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,699
i mean lot more work than most of us are

856
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,199
gonna do i can tell you but uh you can

857
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:31,569
feed a family of four and something like

858
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,489
a thousand square feet yeah I'll check

859
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,809
it out I think I've read some of the

860
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:37,459
Square Foot Gardening and some of those

861
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:40,338
those things yeah ok well they I

862
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,720
I don't like using that word I wouldn't

863
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,549
say they copied him but yeah they

864
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:45,980
borrowed a lot of the biointensive from

865
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,890
chadwick in the French and John Jevons

866
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,719
and he still runs the ecology Center

867
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:52,940
still a Learning Center people still go

868
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,039
take his classes and I know it's not

869
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,329
popular and this is one area that I kind

870
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,179
of disagreed with some of the

871
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:03,199
professionals about don't disturb the

872
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:05,108
soil well okay but I I practice the bio

873
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,239
tetes of where you do the double dig

874
00:36:05,108 --> 00:36:09,049
method and I did really well maybe it

875
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,989
was wrong

876
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:13,970
you know because of the fungal thing you

877
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:15,618
know the other you know I thought it

878
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:18,858
could be in a very effective way and

879
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:21,619
also to check your soil where's my worm

880
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:23,358
count out so the dice still I don't

881
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:26,390
necessarily do because of health reasons

882
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,759
but I would still recommend double dig

883
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:31,730
to those who are serious about learning

884
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,770
a a method of farming that goes back

885
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,309
several thousand years I mean you know

886
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,539
come on

887
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:37,639
there's something to be said for a

888
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:39,019
tried-and-true right yeah I'm a big fan

889
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:41,989
of it I don't think it's fair to compare

890
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:43,759
tilling with digging a bed it's not the

891
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:46,368
same thing so right

892
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,920
I'm all for digging an indoor bed or a

893
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:50,990
raised bed versus going strictly no-tell

894
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,180
now I know Tim Wilson feels otherwise

895
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:56,239
and others the sole of no-till thing has

896
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:59,329
really taken off in article on our blog

897
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,679
on kiss organics exactly about this

898
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:02,029
topic because it was something that I

899
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,309
thought was really interesting yeah a

900
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,769
night for reasons that escape me I've

901
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:09,170
been tagged with the no-till thing and

902
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:11,539
I've never made a post good better and

903
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:14,960
different about no-till I have opinions

904
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:16,608
that are probably counter to the urban

905
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,338
legends but that's completely different

906
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:21,739
from the wheat that I biased from a

907
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:23,500
family co-op over in Eastern Washington

908
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,989
and some families in Eastern Oregon

909
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,190
Shepherds grain and they practice

910
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,929
no-till well that's a whole lot

911
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,389
different than growing in a container I

912
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:33,889
mean you and I had this discussion when

913
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:35,029
Tim was in well - like what's the

914
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:37,250
territory in horticulture and

915
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,619
agriculture and they're not the same

916
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,960
first of all I don't care how good you

917
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,059
are I consider myself pretty good but

918
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,250
I'm not I recognize that their

919
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:48,170
shortcomings in an artificial soil that

920
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,838
we might build we as hard as we might

921
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,559
try it's not the same thing okay like

922
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:54,079
you

923
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:57,500
and your family's garden I've been

924
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:01,519
pumping comfrey on these beds for eight

925
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:03,980
years now and also sometimes I'll take

926
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,769
my garden so a potting soil and I'll

927
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:09,710
apply it on top I've got it where I can

928
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:12,889
stick my hand in my arm almost to my

929
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,539
elbow down into the bed and when I dig

930
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:16,849
around and look for worms I mean there's

931
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:18,920
just a mass of worms okay and according

932
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:21,110
to the experts I'm doing it wrong you

933
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,130
know I shouldn't be I mean I do some

934
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,530
other things I don't plant the tomatoes

935
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,450
in the same bed every year I wouldn't

936
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,180
call it crop rotation but you know you

937
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:32,539
establish the colony of problems in that

938
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:35,509
soil it's in to some degree so do a

939
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:38,449
squash plant there next year or you know

940
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:42,590
the peppers or whatever you know and

941
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:44,750
then I plan I do a lot of beans because

942
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,130
I like them I like stir-fry like what

943
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,289
they call bush beans green beans

944
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:50,570
I like stir-fry them so and that they

945
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:52,759
also add to the tilt but basically my

946
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:55,160
whole program is kelp meal and some bean

947
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,960
every year and that's pretty much it and

948
00:38:55,159 --> 00:39:00,739
then oh yeah worm castings about it I

949
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,470
put a skin on like maybe an inch inch

950
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:05,989
and a half just to get some biology

951
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:08,419
going you know especially after this one

952
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:10,689
or what the worst record and what 75

953
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:15,470
years we went through in the northwest

954
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:16,789
l4a yeah it was rough no snow and I well

955
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:18,619
that too but yeah I mean this was the

956
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:20,929
hardest winter I've been up here 30

957
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:23,599
years and I was nothing about maybe

958
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:25,369
moving back to Southern Cal this was

959
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,860
horrible I mean I want snow where I can

960
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:28,279
drive to it like up it you know Mount

961
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,150
Ranier

962
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,910
I don't need it my yard or driveway I

963
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,769
can't get out of the house and I you

964
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:39,409
know I had a three hundred six month old

965
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:40,730
bull dog that was fun well yeah well Jim

966
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,739
I really appreciate you taking the time

967
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,360
to chat today I feel like we got to

968
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:46,009
cover quite a few subjects and I know

969
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,809
there's a lot more I'd still love to

970
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,490
talk to you about but maybe I can have

971
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:51,980
you back on again oh you bet

972
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:54,859
yes probably uh yeah I like talking

973
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:57,260
about you know stuff that I feel I've I

974
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,820
wouldn't say perfected but uh got into a

975
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,260
level that I feel comfortable telling

976
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,390
others how to you know like the worm

977
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,090
castings and I mean how simple it really

978
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:08,089
is to make a worm bin and

979
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:11,660
well I bought a 100-gallon for $24

980
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,789
gallons smarty for $24 it's not a lot of

981
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:16,699
money and of course thankfully I got a
