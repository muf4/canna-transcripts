about herbariums

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,039
we talk more extensively about it in the

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,959

and how it works in the podcast along

37
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,280
with other topics around cannabis

38
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,158
genetics

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,320
now on to the show hey eleanor thanks

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,520
for coming on the show

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,239
hi it's so great to be here yeah i

42
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,158
wanted to

43
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,798
uh start off you know the last time we

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,359
talked on the show we talked a lot about

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,520
candor and intellectual property and

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,959
those things and it was a great podcast

47
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,478
but i wanted to follow up with you and

48
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,359
talk a little bit more about leaf works

49
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,920
this time

50
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,359
so um why don't you you know why don't

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,560
you give us a brief overview of kandor

52
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,640
for people who might not have heard that

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,320
podcast and then we can really dive into

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,560
uh leaf works excellent yeah so camera

55
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,959
is

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
a cannabis herbarium it's the first and

57
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,158
only dedicated

58
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,478
cannabis herbarium and what that is is a

59
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,759
repository of

60
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,800
physical pressed specimens that help to

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,199
define

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,840
the diversity and the cultivars and

63
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,519
varietals or strains that we see

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,439
that have been held in the community and

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,439
have been lovingly not only

66
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:24,800
bred and differentiated but caretaked

67
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,639
by many many individuals over decades

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,959
and so candor is really a spot where we

69
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,799
can just look at those plants

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
and have a place where the community can

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,319
define the plants that they

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,439
are working with yeah i highly suggest

73
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:38,878
that people are interested in learning

74
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,120
about herbariums to listen to that

75
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,280
podcast because i learned a

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,719
ton of stuff there that i had no idea

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,479
about from talking to you guys

78
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,639
um and that's a separate project

79
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,359
yes it's a totally separate project it's

80
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:57,119
um it's really a project that grew

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,680
out of necessity so leaf works

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,319
at its core its fundamental core is a

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,760
botanical identification company

84
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,158
and so the entire goal of leaf works

85
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,120
is to know what you're buying selling

86
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,079
and growing

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,080
and that really extends into the entire

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,000
herbal market so the natural products

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,680
market so you know when you go into

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,519
a health food store or your local

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
grocery store and you buy

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,719
either a tea or a tincture or an herbal

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,480
supplement

94
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,158
you have a list of ingredients that are

95
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,000
in that product

96
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,399
and what we do is as a third-party

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,919
verifier we look at those botanicals

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
that are going into that product and

99
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,958
verify

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,719
if it says there's echinacea purporia in

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,039
there we verify there is in fact

102
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,120
echinacea propria in there and there

103
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,158
aren't any other plants in there as

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
filler

105
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,759
and so this is a really big deal and in

106
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,399
the

107
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,959
natural food space it's required that

108
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,439
you

109
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,039
have a third party or a verification of

110
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,680
the botanicals that are going

111
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,199
into your products you can't just say

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,959
you're selling ginkgo and then

113
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:04,399
you know sell celery instead

114
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,719
yeah and it's it's important because

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,039
in the botanical trade there's actually

116
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,239
quite a lot of fraud

117
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:15,199
which is i guess an unfortunate truth

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,199
and um some of this fraud is purposeful

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,918
so it's very much like we're gonna add

120
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,400
these plants into this mix because um

121
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,799
the

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,079
adulterant plants are cheaper and we're

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
gonna make some money

124
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,079
so a lot of the fraud is purposeful but

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
some of the fraud is inadvertent so you

126
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,399
have plants that are wild crafted or

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,000
are harvested and occasionally people

128
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,638
are going to pick the wrong things and

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,160
so

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,240
what we do is we work to identify those

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,560
botanical materials that are going into

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,000
products to verify that they are in fact

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,079
the thing that we think they are or that

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,399
they're you know that the label is

135
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,359
saying that they are

136
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,439
so when we started to work in cannabis

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,520
we realized

138
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,879
you know it's hard it's hard to do that

139
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,399
you know if you say it's bubba kush or

140
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,120
you say it's tangy or you say it's

141
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,560
cookies

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
how do you really know you're getting

143
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,519
that plant and so that's where we

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,079
started with

145
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,079
cannabis

146
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,680
and really looking into that and so as a

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,560
botanical identification coming

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,199
if we're going to make a test to verify

149
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,959
that you have ginkgo inside that product

150
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
the first thing we do is go to an

151
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,439
herbarium and get herbarium samples that

152
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,680
have been vetted by a botanist that is

153
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,918
an

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,918
expert in the particular plant of

155
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,680
interest in this case ginkgo

156
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,680
and when you use those herbarium

157
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,759
specimens as reference materials

158
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,240
certified reference material which is a

159
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,879
very important thing and not only

160
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,478
science but in the botanical trade

161
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,639
and so once you have the certified

162
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,000
reference material you can then use this

163
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,918
as your gold standard

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,680
to make in our case a genetic assay

165
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,918
that is going to identify that plant

166
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
based on a reference material that we

167
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,758
know is 100

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,519
the material we're looking for and so

169
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
when we moved into cannabis and we're

170
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,519
really looking to do this

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
value add for our cannabis customers and

172
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,799
our

173
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,839
growers there wasn't this vital resource

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,038
where we could find

175
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,719
certified reference material and so if

176
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,680
there isn't something out there what do

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,440
you have to do

178
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
you have to build it yourself and so

179
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,879
that's how candor came into existence

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
was

181
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,959
this lack of this very important

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,520
resource that the community really needs

183
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,599
in order to be able to empower

184
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,279
themselves to define their material

185
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,840
and so we really are just the vessel

186
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,159
that holds that information for the

187
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,719
community

188
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
so just to make sure i'm understanding

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,360
you correctly

190
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
like for example if someone wanted to

191
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
know if this plant was truly

192
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
let's let's just stick with tangie i

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,439
guess um

194
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,840
you would have to because there's no

195
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,598
good standard right now i would think

196
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,598
you'd have to collect a bunch of samples

197
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:59,120
that people say hey this i have a

198
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,120
true you know pure tangy

199
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,360
genotype here and then that would be

200
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,960
your uh you would kind of collect them

201
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
all and throw out any outliers and then

202
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,478
that would become your

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,038
the standard for changi moving forward

204
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,199
is that

205
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,959
how does this work in an industry where

206
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,478
we don't have

207
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,638
an existing standard i guess

208
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,240
yeah so for some plants it's very

209
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,280
difficult and other plants it's very

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
easy and so

211
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,719
if we're working so we worked a lot with

212
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,598
subcool before he passed

213
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,280
so that was a very easy way of defining

214
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,038
plants they were his plants he was a

215
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,000
breeder he was putting propagules into

216
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,478
the market

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,800
and so we took his plants if they were

218
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,318
cloned super easy we're going to take a

219
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
pressing of the clone we're going to use

220
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,400
that as our reference standard

221
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,720
a lot of his crosses were seed processed

222
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,878
so same mom same dad so we take

223
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,199
a sample of the dad we take samples of

224
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,120
mom and then we take a

225
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
panel of the siblings and say this is

226
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,439
the breath of diversity that now

227
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
is you know terrigasm or whatever the

228
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,038
the plant is that we were

229
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
speaking about in that moment and so

230
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,839
those those

231
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
types of definitions when you're working

232
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,279
with a breeder so we also work with you

233
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,199
know organizations like

234
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,478
humboldt seed company you know

235
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,240
organizations that are breeding and

236
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,000
putting proper bills into the market

237
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,199
it's a much more straightforward

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,478
cut and dry kind of definition

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
when you're working with things that are

240
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,000
like bubba kush or things that are

241
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,439
like community standards things that

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,160
have been traded around

243
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,639
and in the community for a very long

244
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,639
time

245
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,560
it's much more of what you describe what

246
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,199
we do is we take

247
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,918
many samples from organizations that

248
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,080
have held the material for a long time

249
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,278
we've taken you know all of the

250
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
information we have

251
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,278
where they got the plan how long they've

252
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,919
had the plant the

253
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,200
important characteristics that define

254
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,079
that plant

255
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,600
and we will take a wide swath of those

256
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,200
individuals

257
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,240
and then compare them to one another

258
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,480
and say okay out of these 80 samples or

259
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,080
10 samples depending on how great our

260
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,720
sampling is this you know these

261
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
let's say it's 10 samples these nine are

262
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,399
all

263
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,319
holding together and this one doesn't

264
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,320
fit and so we're going to throw it out

265
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
as an outlier

266
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,278
and so that's it's sort of like eating

267
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,958
an elephant you just start where you're

268
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,838
at and you get as much information as

269
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,599
you can and

270
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,040
you know you do this low hanging fruit

271
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
first the ones that are easier where you

272
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,079
still can communicate

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
with a breeder a specific person that's

274
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
doing that work

275
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,320
yeah and then there's other plans that

276
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,440
are you know sort of in community

277
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,240
you you have the community help you

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,000
you know you have multiple people who oh

279
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,600
i know i gave this to this person in the

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
80s or i you know

281
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
um of really good examples of harlequin

282
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
so wade laughter

283
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,319
is the original breeder of harlequin he

284
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,200
knows that he

285
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
gave some of those plants um to be sold

286
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
to herbicide during a certain period of

287
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,719
time so then i run into an individual

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,680
that's like oh i bought this plant

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
you know in 92 from herbicide then i

290
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,719
have confidence that it's the same plant

291
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
and then when we compare them we see

292
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,079
that yes they do genetically hold up and

293
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
they physically hold up when we compare

294
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,199
the herbarium specimens to one another

295
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,399
and the

296
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
you know characteristics that are

297
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,240
driving the phenotype of the plant

298
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,078
so it's a little bit of investigation

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,919
but it's really having the community

300
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,799
lead us to where we need to get

301
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,360
to make the definition of the plant so

302
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,719
can you know

303
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,879
it's a lot like any other plant yeah so

304
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,360
so basically can do can you say

305
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,320
that uh like let's let's just take the

306
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,919
example with harlequin um

307
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,640
you could you could say that a plant

308
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,919
then it does has no harlequin actually

309
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,879
in it like if they claimed it was a

310
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,838
harlequin cross and then conversely

311
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,278
uh if harlequin was derived and not into

312
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
the plant genetics like

313
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,639
some people are let's say it was derived

314
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
from another

315
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,799
cultivar originally another varietal

316
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
would you be able to see that

317
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
in the harlequin so you could say oh

318
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
this was originally pulled it had a

319
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,639
little bit of

320
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,399
you know cushion it or a little bit of

321
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,879
something else

322
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,679
or yeah yes you can definitely do that

323
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,360
and you need

324
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,359
you know you need a lot of information

325
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,240
to do that from genetic information but

326
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,560
yes that is part of what we do is

327
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,759
um you know some individuals would come

328
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,799
to us and say

329
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,399
i think i have this and then we make

330
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,000
sure we have enough of the reference

331
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,799
samples to be able to

332
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,519
investigate is it that and we can look

333
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,879
and see

334
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,919
if that is a possible parental cross for

335
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,720
a mystery plant or we can take a planet

336
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,719
where someone

337
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
thinks they have what they you know they

338
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
think they know what they have and then

339
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,719
we look at it and

340
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,719
you can say yes it looks like it is in

341
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
this line it looks like it is a cross of

342
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
these

343
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
individuals or no that we can't find any

344
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,200
evidence of

345
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,199
this particular plant in its pedigree

346
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,679
so this is kind of an off question too

347
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,919
i'm wondering

348
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,719
how often do you just see plants that

349
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,360
have the same

350
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,240
physical morphology or growth habits

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,680
that and

352
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,000
you know someone might think it's a you

353
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,679
know cookies for example and then you

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
you do the genetic testing on it and

355
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,679
you're like this really isn't

356
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
related to cookies or you know even

357
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,638
though it may look similar

358
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,200
does that happen yeah it does happen

359
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,639
it absolutely happens but the cannabis

360
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
is an amazingly

361
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,360
plastic plant so plasticity is this kind

362
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,920
of cool genetic term

363
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,839
where the environment really affects the

364
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,719
phenotype so you can have

365
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
the same phenotype looking very

366
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,079
different

367
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,159
in different environments and conversely

368
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,199
you can have a lot of different

369
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:47,679
genotypes converging on similar

370
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,680
phenotypes so there's a lot of

371
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,600
complexity and and one of those those

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,360
aspects is the plasticity of cannabis so

373
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,240
it's it's a beautiful aspect and it's

374
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,639
also a challenging aspect of the plant

375
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
yeah now i've been saying and maybe

376
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
you'll correct me here

377
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,759
that cannabis one is probably at some of

378
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
the greatest diversity we'll

379
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,278
we've ever seen and may ever see with

380
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,000
this plant just because of

381
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,120
uh this latest surge of you know

382
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,799
legalization

383
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,959
and breeding but i assume over time

384
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,799
with capitalism work and commercialism

385
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,958
we're going to see diversity

386
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,078
go down but it seems like we're at sort

387
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,518
of a peak

388
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,359
in that regard i'd be curious to your

389
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,519
thoughts on that

390
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,720
and then along those lines in terms of

391
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,480
in terms of diversity um

392
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,639
are you are you feeling like we're still

393
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,240
discovering new

394
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,759
things regarding the genetics of

395
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
cannabis and um

396
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,439
learning more every day or do you feel

397
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,399
like you're starting to get a handle for

398
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,680
what

399
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,639
what this plant contains

400
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,479
oh man well the answer to the first

401
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,240
question

402
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,600
cannabis is exceptionally diverse

403
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,000
it is sort of it is the

404
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
the best example of the more you love

405
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
something

406
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
the more diverse you'll make it i think

407
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
we have a couple of excellent examples

408
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,360
of humans

409
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,959
um in the plant world i think we can

410
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
you point to something that we just love

411
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:22,000
so much we really

412
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,959
make the diversity that we you know we

413
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,240
have access to

414
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,799
we we expand it and we explode the types

415
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,278
that we

416
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,319
um the types of plants that we have

417
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,919
around us

418
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,959
so yeah you can definitely see that in a

419
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,319
lot of our ornamentals but i think roses

420
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,159
is a big one

421
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,320
and dogs is another one right so yeah

422
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,319
i can take a wolf and make all of the

423
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
different breeds that we have

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
and you know it's just something like

425
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,760
anything that we love or find

426
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,440
useful um we as humans are very good at

427
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,399
caretaking things that can never

428
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,480
survive on their own and in doing that

429
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,480
we really do expand that diversity in

430
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,800
this immense and awesome way

431
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
and i think cannabis is absolutely a

432
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,359
really good poster child for that

433
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,799
the amount of difference that we have

434
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,560
not only in smells

435
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:15,278
and and statures and leaf shape

436
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,719
is kind of a mind-boggling and i don't

437
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,159
think we're at a limit i don't think

438
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,440
we're at the end of that

439
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,439
i feel like as we

440
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,480
not move away i don't think we'll ever

441
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,879
move away for growing

442
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
growing cannabis for its chemistry but i

443
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,799
think that we

444
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,120
will return to growing cannabis for a

445
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,000
lot of other purposes as well especially

446
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,120
as the hemp

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,240
movement gains traction

448
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,480
and that aspect of

449
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,000
agriculture expands i think we're going

450
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,120
to see a lot more diversity i think

451
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,440
we're going to see a lot more

452
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,240
cannabis and you know hemp same is the

453
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,399
same plant

454
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,759
so a lot more cannabis that is

455
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,039
specifically grown for

456
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,639
fibers or to be useful in concrete type

457
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,599
applications or packaging

458
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,720
applications and so i think we're going

459
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,000
to see a lot of

460
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,560
expansion of diversity in those realms

461
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,879
in the near future in addition to just

462
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,119
the fact that every time we look at

463
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,759
the plant we find more chemicals that

464
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,039
are doing more amazing things

465
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,639
you know it's like phcv or cbd you know

466
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,679
cbdg or

467
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,919
cbn or any of these compounds the more

468
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,519
we look and investigate the more we find

469
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,319
it's really this

470
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,078
treasure trove of amazing pharmacopoeial

471
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,839
chemistry that

472
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,919
you know as humans we really resonate

473
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,600
with with our own endocannabinoid system

474
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,679
so i think the diversity in cannabis

475
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
is only going to increase as we

476
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,519
understand it more and so that really

477
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,278
gets at the genetics

478
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,839
and you know we're really just at the

479
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,720
very very tip of the iceberg with

480
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,839
understanding

481
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,519
um the genetics of cannabis

482
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,360
one of the things i like to say quite

483
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,799
often is

484
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,120
really comparing it to corn so

485
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,000
when i went to grad school the

486
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,438
university that i was at

487
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,880
i think nadia just in the building i was

488
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,079
in when i was in the botany

489
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,199
i was in the genetics department um that

490
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,359
department i think had

491
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,880
seven labs working on course and then if

492
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,918
you went over to the botany department

493
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,079
you would probably add

494
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,000
five or six additional labs and then if

495
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,038
you went over to the ag department you'd

496
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,319
add five or six

497
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,160
more so you know you have 20 30 labs at

498
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,439
a single institution

499
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,759
that that work on corn and i think if

500
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,679
you

501
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,759
you know play that forward with cannabis

502
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,880
the same thing is going to happen

503
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,919
because we really don't know very much

504
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,799
prohibition has really limited our

505
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,440
understanding of the science of these

506
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,679
plants

507
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,679
and you know it takes a lot of work

508
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,720
to really drive down and understand

509
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,640
genes specific genes that are driving

510
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,558
phenotypes i mean we can get some broad

511
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,679
strokes pretty easily but

512
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:10,798
to really understand the interplay of

513
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,400
the entire genetic architecture so all

514
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,119
of the genes and all of the

515
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,840
other components in the genetics that

516
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,558
derive a particular phenotype

517
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,279
i mean that's years of research and loss

518
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,079
of mind

519
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,599
like time on task so i feel like we're

520
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,639
going to learn more and more

521
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,359
and the next decade is going to be a

522
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,520
very cool

523
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,918
time to be interested in genetics of

524
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,918
cannabis

525
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,160
i have so many questions

526
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,678
yeah so the one thing that you're your

527
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,038
recent comments uh just now made me

528
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,160
think about though uh

529
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,558
was a friend had sent me an article on

530
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,000
uh researchers it was in nature i can

531
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:52,399
post it on the podcast page and we're

532
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
done

533
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,320
uh of scientists uh brewing cannabis

534
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,200
using uh

535
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,480
beer yeast um the saccharomyces

536
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,720
cerviceae and

537
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,759
um i was wondering if you'd seen

538
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,360
anything on that because they're

539
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,279
actually able to

540
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,959
turn you know certain compounds into thc

541
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,798
obviously you're not going to get the

542
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,000
full

543
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,000
collection of diversity and compounds

544
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,240
that you get in a cannabis plant

545
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
i know as scientists a lot of scientists

546
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,000
are very derivative they're trying to

547
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,400
break down these you know individual

548
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,919
compounds like thc

549
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,480
you know we're seeing synergistic

550
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,840
effects between you know

551
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,200
different cannabinoids and terpenes and

552
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,959
how they all kind of play a role

553
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,400
together in terms of a

554
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,000
an experience for a user or a medical

555
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,038
a medical effect how do you think this

556
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,880
is going to change

557
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,480
you know someone who's a geneticist how

558
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,520
do how do you take an article like this

559
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,400
and how do you think that's going to

560
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,400
affect our industry

561
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,959
yeah i think it's been affected in a lot

562
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
of different ways but i really do look

563
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,440
to

564
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,479
the you know the precedent that's really

565
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,360
been set with

566
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
um herbalism and the natural products

567
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,839
world

568
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,599
we know that we can extract chemicals

569
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,558
from plants and use them in a very

570
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,319
pointed way

571
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,798
and as a site in my science brain i

572
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,599
completely understand

573
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,400
the need to approach things in that

574
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,639
derivative

575
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,200
kind of way and it's really just

576
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,080
to simplify it enough so that we can

577
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,519
understand

578
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,879
things about how chemicals are either

579
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,279
derived or how they're

580
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,280
specifically functioning within a

581
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,319
particular system or on a particular

582
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,319
cell type

583
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,558
and so i think those derivative type of

584
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
experiments that derivative or that very

585
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,798
like

586
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,080
let's look at one chemical at a time

587
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,038
kind of thinking

588
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,798
is exceptionally important to deepen our

589
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,640
understanding

590
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,440
but i don't necessarily think it

591
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,200
produces the best medicine

592
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
so i don't think that our you know

593
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,679
understanding and

594
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,640
utility are not the same thing in my

595
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,120
world

596
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,038
so i definitely have a deep appreciation

597
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,319
for that kind of work and the need for

598
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,960
that kind of work

599
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,399
but when we really look to something

600
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,360
when we really look at herbal medicine

601
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,159
in general

602
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,839
we often find that just because we can

603
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,159
pinpoint a chemical that has

604
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,678
80 or 90 percent of the effect on

605
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,200
whatever pathology

606
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,720
that we're looking at it doesn't mean

607
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,679
that it is effective

608
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,279
at curing the pathology

609
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,880
and i think we'll see that with cannabis

610
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,038
especially with the ensemble or

611
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
entourage effect with

612
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,798
the multitude of chemicals that are

613
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,279
acting in concert

614
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,839
i think it becomes so complex to really

615
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,720
understand

616
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,519
how all of those things are really

617
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,240
affecting

618
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:52,960
your you know positive outcome i

619
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,159
i don't think we're going to be able to

620
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
replace

621
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,520
the benefits of the herbal medicine with

622
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,038
a pill

623
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,798
i just and i don't think it's in our

624
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,359
best interest to do that but you're also

625
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:06,319
speaking to

626
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,319
someone who has a lot of faith and

627
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,960
i don't know confidence in herbal

628
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
medicine as

629
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,000
especially as a primary medicinal

630
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,480
modality

631
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,599
i mean western medicine is amazing at

632
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
what it does and

633
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,839
there's no there's no escaping the need

634
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,640
for like acute

635
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,319
medicine at certain times but if you're

636
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,200
looking at more holistic medicine

637
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,319
especially you know food as medicine and

638
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,000
herbs as medicine

639
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:36,000
for health and longevity and vitality

640
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,679
um you're never going to get that in a

641
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,919
derivative product

642
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,360
as far as i'm concerned and so you know

643
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,280
it'll be much like anything

644
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,519
sometimes we're going to be able to find

645
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,639
a single molecule that has like 90

646
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,158
of the effect to make something um

647
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,159
you know cure something or have you know

648
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,000
the positive medicinal

649
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
effect that we need but i don't think

650
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,759
that's going to be the norm

651
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,279
i think it's much more complicated than

652
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,319
that and

653
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,960
you know the chemistry of cannabis is is

654
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:08,558
radical

655
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,840
there's so many there's so much going on

656
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,839
i think that the plant the plant

657
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,879
medicine is still going to be really

658
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,480
important

659
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,799
and the plants themselves and i think

660
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,640
the industry can really lean on that

661
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,558
especially as we understand more and

662
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,799
more about

663
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,119
the diversity of plants how different

664
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,639
plants do better in different areas

665
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,158
right so we're going to start i think

666
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
epilations and the

667
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,600
and the real understanding of that

668
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,119
interaction between the genotypes the

669
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,719
different plants themselves and the

670
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,639
environments in which they're in and how

671
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,480
that really affects the quality of those

672
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,480
plants i think that's going to be

673
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,839
the most exciting information

674
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,880
that we you know dig into in the next

675
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,519
couple years okay

676
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,278
yeah i'm curious to see too i i mean my

677
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,798
brain was just thinking while you were

678
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,599
talking about how i could see

679
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:01,359
potentially people using

680
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:03,519
uh you know thc compounds derived from

681
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,240
yeast to boost their thc numbers

682
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,960
in their uh final product even if that

683
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
product had

684
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,240
oh yeah you know kind of like what

685
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,159
you're describing with the fillers

686
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,359
and uh the supplement industry at the

687
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,480
beginning of the podcast

688
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,000
yeah so yeah and i can see people

689
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,759
extracting terpenes not only

690
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
from cannabis from other you know if you

691
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,519
want something tastes like lemonade i

692
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,120
mean

693
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,558
you're getting from some citrus than it

694
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,678
is from you know i mean

695
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:29,359
i think there's a there will be there

696
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,640
will be

697
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,319
there will be a market for that and

698
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,320
there will be players do that feels like

699
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,519
the best solution

700
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,038
um and i think we're going to have

701
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,918
different quality metrics and that's

702
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,759
going to be a very

703
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,240
interesting thing to watch especially as

704
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,400
someone who sits here as like a third

705
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,278
party lab someone who is really trying

706
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,278
to communicate

707
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,880
the essence of the material that's being

708
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,519
sold so that

709
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,480
not only can individuals who have

710
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,038
special material

711
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,798
articulate that to their consumers but

712
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,960
so that consumers can start making

713
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,480
choices about what they want and i think

714
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,919
that'll be

715
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,960
the real power is how does the

716
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,159
consumer move the ball

717
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,200
forward right like does the consumer

718
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,960
want a high thc

719
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,679
product even if it means we're spraying

720
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,319
easter even thc on

721
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:27,600
on flour you know i'd maybe not

722
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,599
and so i think we'll be able to

723
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:34,000
i don't know yeah i don't know either

724
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,080
right like it's you know that some

725
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,839
people want to

726
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,678
when you look at the alcohol industry i

727
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,678
know this is not the best example or the

728
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,679
best parallel but

729
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,600
you know some sometimes you want a table

730
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,440
line and you don't care that it's

731
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,038
three different kinds of grapes and you

732
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,600
know it comes in a box

733
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,319
like that that's what the situation

734
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,759
calls for

735
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,000
and then other times you know it's

736
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,480
celebration and you want a very special

737
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,200
pinot noir from the wilmette valley you

738
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
know

739
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
and so i think we're going to have that

740
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,080
kind of product differentiation

741
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,640
and that's what's going to add in my

742
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:11,038
mind the value to the the smaller

743
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,880
family farm or the craft farm where

744
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,519
they're really growing a specific kind

745
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,159
of plant in a specific area

746
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,960
and the quality is what's going to drive

747
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,440
you know

748
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,960
the value of that product now using your

749
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,720
alcohol example i would look at it a

750
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,720
different way i would say

751
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,640
hey you know we have a market for wine

752
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,759
you know because i want a glass of wine

753
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,559
i don't want

754
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,359
ethanol you know like i want something

755
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,918
that has

756
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,759
flavor i want to have something that has

757
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,840
enjoyment i'm not looking for just the

758
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:45,440
effect of being like

759
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,678
you know inebriated so

760
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,480
that to me is sort of like a cannabis

761
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,400
versus

762
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,679
you know thc product derived from

763
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
another source i

764
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,600
but growing cannabis is hard you know

765
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,678
commercially it's difficult

766
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,798
so i i i do see where something like

767
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,798
this could gain

768
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:01,839
traction and it you know it concerns me

769
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,960
a little bit but

770
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,480
i was just curious from like a

771
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,400
geneticist perspective what you were

772
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,400
thinking so

773
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,840
yeah well there's this great little like

774
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,679
meme that's going around

775
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,720
about um you know potency and

776
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,559
effects and i think as we as

777
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,319
consumers get over the novelty

778
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,079
of being allowed to interact with

779
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,759
cannabis in a legal way

780
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,199
you know i think that novelty's got to

781
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,798
kind of wear off

782
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,240
so that instead of just having this

783
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:32,960
giddiness about being able to have

784
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
access

785
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,880
we can all of a sudden say oh it's not

786
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,599
oh i can get it it's

787
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,240
what do i really want and i think you're

788
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,879
right

789
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,359
i don't just want ethanol i would like

790
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,720
something that is delicious

791
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,519
and so i i feel like as we lose the

792
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,919
novelty

793
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,918
of

794
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,120
being able to access the plants

795
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,079
then we'll have much more of a

796
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,278
discerning

797
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:08,079
kind of um

798
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,079
pilot driven consumer

799
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,399
yeah but you know it remains you've seen

800
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,480
how it'll really play out but

801
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,719
i i don't think that everyone just wants

802
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,679
to get inebriated

803
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,839
for most people and you know and that's

804
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,360
it's also us growing up as a as a

805
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,038
consumer too

806
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,839
yeah learning about what's out there

807
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,079
it's hard to know what you want if you

808
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,439
haven't

809
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,798
had a lot of experience too absolutely i

810
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,960
was just going to say for folks who

811
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,079
haven't listened to my podcast with dr

812
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,640
ady ray where we

813
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,519
where she talks literally just about

814
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,919
this topic

815
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,519
and the idea of applying science to user

816
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,480
experience

817
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,000
and how thc is not the driver uh when

818
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,919
you start doing blind test

819
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,440
tests with people in terms of what

820
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,278
creates a better experience

821
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,880
it's really interesting i need to i need

822
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,079
to follow up with her but she's working

823
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,880
with uh you know jeremy

824
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,158
plum and uh stephanie barnhart and they

825
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,080
have a really cool thing that they're

826
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,679
doing in portland around

827
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,599
this concept so um yeah i will have to

828
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,640
follow up with her and ask her the same

829
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,918
question

830
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,240
um yeah i would love to hear

831
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,320
that follow up because it is true it's

832
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,880
absolutely true like right the teenager

833
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,918
is like yeah i'll drink some ethanol

834
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,200
but you know me i'm not

835
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,720
gonna do that so i i

836
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,200
completely am curious about how

837
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,159
it kind of um i'm curious about how the

838
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,399
education

839
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,240
of the consumer goes because that's also

840
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,519
a very important

841
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,839
aspect of you know deepening

842
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,839
understanding of the plant and the value

843
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,759
that differentiates different kinds

844
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,319
of growing methods and different kinds

845
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:53,599
of plants themselves

846
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,359
absolutely absolutely um

847
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,719
so there was something i wanted to ask

848
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,278
you a little while back here while we

849
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,480
were talking

850
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,798
i didn't want to forget um so as someone

851
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,440
who

852
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,879
loves growing tomatoes you know i will

853
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,200
choose varieties that

854
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,360
finish sooner you know i'll tend to

855
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,000
choose determinate plants depending on

856
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,079
how much

857
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,480
height i have um i'll look for things

858
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,439
that have some level of resistance

859
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,880
you know like uh may not be as likely to

860
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,919
get powdery mildew or

861
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,679
or rust or you know whatever whatever

862
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,440
crop i'm growing i look for those

863
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,798
you know disease resistance in the

864
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,000
varietals that i choose

865
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,759
for my vegetables are we making any

866
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,398
progress in that regard with with

867
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,879
cannabis

868
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,798
are you starting to see markers

869
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:42,720
associated with some level of resistance

870
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,720
to certain pathogens

871
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,720
yeah we definitely are slowly making

872
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,679
strides

873
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
the the hard thing with both

874
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,159
susceptibility and

875
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,440
resistance is that very very rarely

876
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,200
is it a single gene situation

877
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
where you know you have this gene and

878
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,440
you are resistant to this

879
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,720
that's sort of the exception rather than

880
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,360
the rule

881
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,679
and so those types of plants are going

882
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,719
to be

883
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,640
complicated to breed in a lot of ways

884
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,079
and especially because there's this

885
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,559
really interesting

886
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,278
and dynamic interplay between a lot of

887
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,319
the

888
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:24,798
the molecules we really like in cannabis

889
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,759
um that taste good you know a lot of

890
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,558
those are also

891
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,158
the molecules that plants are using to

892
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,359
defend against

893
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,880
their own pests and predators um whether

894
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,158
they be insects or

895
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,399
or viruses and and so

896
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,760
there is this this moment where

897
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,079
sometimes breeding

898
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,960
things to make them more resistant will

899
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,240
make them less flavorful

900
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,759
and i mean we see that in a lot of

901
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,759
plants and that's really just

902
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,879
understanding

903
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,038
understanding the plant and

904
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,640
understanding how to decouple those

905
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,079
things so you don't lose

906
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,559
you don't lose the characteristics you

907
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,480
like while moving the plant in a

908
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,879
direction that makes it more robust

909
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,399
to pests and pathogens and we're

910
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,240
definitely making moves in that

911
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,759
direction but i think it'll be a long

912
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,519
and complicated process

913
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:16,000
to really hone in on the nuances

914
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,720
of all of the different aspects of the

915
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,119
plants

916
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,440
especially when you're looking at you

917
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,839
know flavonoids and terpenes and all

918
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,480
those

919
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:30,000
taste taste molecules smell molecules

920
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,960
in addition to yield and

921
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,440
uh water you know water usage and you

922
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,038
know there's

923
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,720
there's so many things when looking at a

924
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,079
plant and

925
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,759
in a lot of ways we have as a community

926
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,240
a cannabis community

927
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,119
selected plants that are really great at

928
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,079
producing

929
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,439
the chemistry we want and not super

930
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,720
great at living

931
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,798
you know because especially if you're

932
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,798
doing it inside you can really baby that

933
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,839
plant in a way that

934
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,960
is just not going to work at scale and

935
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,720
so i think we're going to have a little

936
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,399
bit of a challenge to take some of those

937
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,079
plants that have been

938
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:09,278
bred in that extreme flavor

939
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,119
direction without any regard to

940
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,119
you know can the plants stand up on its

941
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,158
own like the plant might have

942
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,918
glorious colas but if the if the stems

943
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,440
aren't strong enough to hold them up

944
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,120
it you know it becomes more of a

945
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,159
challenge to grow and so i think we're

946
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,639
going to have to undo

947
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,278
some of those issues that we

948
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,640
inadvertently created

949
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,440
by growing in the styles that we've been

950
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,640
growing

951
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,519
through prohibition yeah

952
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,440
so two points i want to make one

953
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,880
resistance two is a sliding scale

954
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,480
like you may have a room with a bunch of

955
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,360
cultivars and one may be

956
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,519
less likely to get it or not display as

957
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,558
many symptoms too let's say botrytis or

958
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,480
powdery mildew

959
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,480
but that's not to say that if your spore

960
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,440
pressure gets high enough it's not ever

961
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,440
going to get it

962
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,759
so uh you know i think we have to be

963
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,919
careful with the word resistance

964
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,200
when people think of what genetics and

965
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,038
then uh

966
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,319
the other thing i wanted to mention

967
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:08,878
around it was um

968
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,559
oh just that uh you know when we when we

969
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,440
talk about this

970
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,000
this level of of diversity in these

971
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,000
plants

972
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,679
um it makes it makes

973
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,079
it makes it really hard to really know

974
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,960
what we're seeing over time i think so

975
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,639
um you know someone may say this plant

976
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,599
didn't get powdery mildew well

977
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,760
like i said you don't know how much

978
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,079
spore pressure you had in the room um

979
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,599
yep you know and yeah and maybe your

980
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,280
cover crop gets it but it's not the same

981
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,320
powdery melody that affects cannabis

982
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,560
you know there's there's all these

983
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
different variables so it's a long

984
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,799
i i totally agree it's gonna be a long

985
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,559
journey on in that regard

986
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,320
absolutely and i think that point that

987
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,799
you made is right

988
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,760
is hitting the nail on the head it's

989
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,359
it's just this dance between

990
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
you know something may not get root rot

991
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,358
but if you put it in standing water

992
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,440
it's probably gonna rot you know so it's

993
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,799
it's definitely um

994
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
that interplay with the environment

995
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,359
whether it be the number of pests or

996
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,280
kind of pests

997
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,960
and yeah some things are going to be

998
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,200
better equipped to deal with it but it

999
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,920
is

1000
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:12,399
it is a scale so that's a very um

1001
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,079
important point i'm glad you made that

1002
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,358
yeah and i also you know you brought the

1003
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,079
point of how we were breeding during

1004
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,279
prohibition

1005
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,400
well i think uh at that point in time

1006
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
unfortunately there were a lot of

1007
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,519
growers using systemic

1008
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,639
fungicides so you were able to grow

1009
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,880
these like massive

1010
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,719
buds that literally would not get

1011
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,000
botrytis because they had

1012
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,118
you know your people were using eagle

1013
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,159
20. uh and so

1014
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,920
you just you cannot grow these things uh

1015
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,838
to the same size and scale without

1016
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,960
getting botrytis you know organically

1017
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,719
for the most part so

1018
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,559
i you know we're kind of working

1019
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,519
backwards from some of that stuff too i

1020
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,599
think

1021
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,880
um i agree i totally agree yeah

1022
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,880
and for some plants and you're moving

1023
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
them outside it's going to help them

1024
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,079
and other plants are just not going to

1025
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,440
cut it they're just outside is going to

1026
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,000
be

1027
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,440
a violent and dangerous place for them

1028
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
if they're not going to be able to

1029
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,800
survive

1030
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,079
so you know and that's and that's okay i

1031
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
think we're going to utilize

1032
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,680
the beauty of those plants and use them

1033
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,519
in breeding programs and

1034
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,879
and i think a lot of those a lot of that

1035
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,000
diversity is going to help us

1036
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,240
understand you know the

1037
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,920
basically the genetics that underpin the

1038
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,118
characteristics that we love

1039
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,599
so that we can track those

1040
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,000
characteristics down in plants that

1041
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,519
are better suited for environments and

1042
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,079
situations that don't

1043
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,679
you know need massive amounts of water

1044
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,599
or massive amounts of

1045
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,039
fungicide i mean that's just not gonna

1046
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,760
not gonna work

1047
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,559
in a market where you're you know

1048
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,160
testing your plants for

1049
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,880
human health like yeah your uh your

1050
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,239
outside

1051
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,480
outdoor comment brought up another

1052
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,279
question for me so i hear a lot of talk

1053
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,320
around

1054
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,240
genetic drift or genetic degradation

1055
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,838
with clones

1056
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,118
i've heard people say you have to move

1057
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,159
you know take your clone and then grow

1058
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,680
it outdoors

1059
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:08,078
and read it every four years or whatever

1060
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:09,440
length of time what are you seeing

1061
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,039
you know with people who are cloning the

1062
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,599
same plant over and over again are you

1063
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,800
seeing

1064
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,680
a lot of genetic drift over time or

1065
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,000
mutation

1066
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,000
slowly on a given you know clone

1067
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,799
you know i don't think anyone has enough

1068
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,118
really good data to give a robust answer

1069
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,960
to that you do see something that drift

1070
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,760
that is something we see like we'll i'll

1071
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,679
look at clones or clone operations and

1072
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,880
you know things aren't aren't 100

1073
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,759
identical they're 99.8 or 99.9 percent

1074
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,599
identical so

1075
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,200
there is definitely somatic mutations

1076
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,000
that happen

1077
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,519
um i think that the the health and

1078
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,760
well-being of clones though from

1079
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,159
at least what i have seen in the in the

1080
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,680
experiences that we've had at leafworks

1081
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,920
and the groups that we've worked with

1082
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,159
looking at this kind of question

1083
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,079
most of the time when we have plants

1084
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,480
that just aren't doing very well

1085
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,640
and the idea of bringing them outside

1086
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,880
it's generally pest

1087
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,838
and pathogen load that's doing the

1088
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,079
damage

1089
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,279
it's not the drifting of the genetics

1090
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,160
like the genetics are

1091
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,960
similar enough you know 99.9 percent

1092
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,319
similar

1093
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,838
and there are other external

1094
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,720
circumstances that are driving um

1095
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:27,679
like the decline in the plants not so

1096
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:30,480
much just the fact that it's a clone

1097
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,480
okay so

1098
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,200
i could see that yeah and i mean certain

1099
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,039
things that are systemic that like

1100
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,799
you know in terms of diseases that could

1101
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,639
cause a a

1102
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,480
different you know poor expression of

1103
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:45,759
of that plant over time if you're if

1104
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,358
you're cloning it i could definitely see

1105
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,880
that

1106
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,400
and just like anything if you're cloning

1107
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,838
in and you have a plant that's 30 years

1108
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,960
old you know i've had 30 years

1109
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,719
to acquire bugs

1110
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,159
along the way you know whether they be

1111
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,799
viruses or

1112
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,440
or you know just pressure from other

1113
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,480
other

1114
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,960
predators um

1115
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,559
you know and a newly germinated seed is

1116
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,358
seen as like a baby it just it hasn't

1117
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,519
had as many

1118
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:16,000
negative interactions to affect it

1119
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,599
does extreme stress affect genetic

1120
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,358
expression

1121
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,200
over time like let's say you had a plant

1122
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,838
that had huge amount you had a big

1123
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,358
mite problem will that potentially cause

1124
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,639
greater genetic drift

1125
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:31,920
or other issues i don't

1126
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,159
i don't from there's no evidence that it

1127
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,358
creates greater genetic drift but what

1128
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,879
it does do is it can

1129
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:42,239
change gene expression

1130
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:47,039
so anything that stresses a plant out

1131
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:49,199
absolutely affects gene expression

1132
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,960
and so that can be that can be positive

1133
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,319
or it can be negative we have certain

1134
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,440
medicinal plants that

1135
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,480
you actually want to whack back or cut

1136
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,000
all the leaves

1137
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,240
right before you're going to harvest the

1138
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,519
medicinal part of the plant because

1139
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:06,399
the emulation of

1140
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:06,880
predators like eating the leaves will

1141
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
boost

1142
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,000
the the production of the you know the

1143
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,639
phytochemistry

1144
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,480
that you're actually interested in as a

1145
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,118
person using the plant for a medicinal

1146
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,719
purpose

1147
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,559
right and so that's an odd one where

1148
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,799
predation actually increases

1149
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,799
the chemistry that you're looking for

1150
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,480
and that happens in certain plants and

1151
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,079
i'm sure we'll see that with cannabis

1152
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,000
you know heat stress is going to

1153
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,359
i mean we see that with cannabis later

1154
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,679
we already do see

1155
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,719
yeah teeth stress makes them hurt and do

1156
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,519
all these things

1157
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,000
and so we definitely see um changes in

1158
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,318
the gene

1159
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,440
expression based on on stressors for

1160
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:40,639
sure

1161
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,039
but that's not necessarily going to

1162
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,759
carry on to the next

1163
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,759
um the next generation or even

1164
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,319
necessarily into a clone like let's say

1165
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,440
you had

1166
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,480
a vegetated plant prior like before

1167
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,280
cloning it

1168
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,719
that um it just went through a variety

1169
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
of stress let's say you forgot to water

1170
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,639
it

1171
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,480
maybe it got too hot maybe didn't get

1172
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,000
enough light you know whatever and you

1173
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,159
nurse it back to health

1174
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
at that point you know i know as a human

1175
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,519
like my cortisol levels have probably

1176
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,760
gone through the roof and then come back

1177
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,559
down but am i passing that on

1178
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,119
to my children at some point when i have

1179
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,960
to have a

1180
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,559
have a child or like in this case if

1181
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,440
you're cloning a plant is that getting

1182
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,519
passed on

1183
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,679
or is that just go away

1184
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,358
yeah so it's going to go way more easily

1185
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,719
if you go through a seed round

1186
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,440
right because the genetics genetics are

1187
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,919
transferred

1188
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,519
um epigenetics so things that change

1189
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,079
expression so like

1190
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,719
change methylation patterns and and how

1191
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,280
things are

1192
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:43,358
are regulated that is much more um

1193
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,720
damaging epigenetic change like

1194
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:46,880
epigenetics

1195
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,318
are not heritable in the same way that

1196
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,000
stan you know like the dna

1197
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:54,000
is heritable um and so

1198
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,358
cloning though you're not actually going

1199
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
through a gamete you're not actually

1200
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:58,318
going through

1201
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,599
you know sexual reproduction and so

1202
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,880
cloning you can actually

1203
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,599
carry those epigenetic changes

1204
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,039
on for a lot longer right like some of

1205
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,480
those changes are permanent and you

1206
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,559
can't undo them

1207
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,079
and so that stress really can affect the

1208
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,440
plant more long-term

1209
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,280
as a clone that's so interesting

1210
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,200
you're just like you know like there's

1211
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,040
these great twin studies that we've done

1212
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,519
as humans where

1213
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,480
you know one twin will smoke or one one

1214
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,000
one trend will

1215
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,920
run marathons all the time whatever it

1216
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
is and and it changes

1217
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,519
the epigenetic context of their genetics

1218
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,519
diff you know so they have differential

1219
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,838
expression of different genes and thus

1220
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,639
have

1221
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,318
differential health um as a result of

1222
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,118
their actions and you know positive and

1223
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,880
negative ways

1224
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,880
and so i'm positive as we dig in

1225
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,960
and and look more closely at these

1226
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,599
things especially because we can look at

1227
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,280
them with

1228
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,960
the you know we have clones that's like

1229
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,200
the best thing for a geneticist to be

1230
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,440
able to understand anything

1231
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,239
is to be able to look at clones and so i

1232
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,240
feel like we're gonna

1233
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,279
we're gonna understand more and more

1234
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,039
about this

1235
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,680
as we go but yes we can expect

1236
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,679
that epigenetics will remain in a clone

1237
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,519
a lot longer epigenetic changes will

1238
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,919
remain in the clone a lot longer than

1239
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:18,239
plants that are going through sexual

1240
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,280
reproduction

1241
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,799
that's so fascinating now before i

1242
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,960
forget though i wanted to cover

1243
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,960
sort of the elephant in the room we

1244
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,440
talked about this in the last podcast

1245
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,679
but

1246
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,720
you know people are sending you plant

1247
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,159
samples

1248
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,279
uh you know t leaf tissue uh enough for

1249
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,480
you to be able to do these

1250
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,880
these types of genetic testing what

1251
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,920
you know as a grower what are the risks

1252
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,640
associated with that

1253
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,318
in regard to protecting and preserving

1254
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,358
intellectual property or that plant

1255
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,039
themselves

1256
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,119
that they feel that they have some of

1257
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:54,559
ownership over

1258
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,599
well leaf works is very very um

1259
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,078
direct about their genetic our genetic

1260
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,400
data policy so any plants that we

1261
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,079
take in to do a test whether it be a

1262
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,000
gender id test where we're helping you

1263
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,200
sex your plants early

1264
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,119
or other tests looking at

1265
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,960
um different um either cultivar id tests

1266
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,318
or sort of we do a double check just to

1267
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,679
make sure that you have a plan you think

1268
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,079
you have

1269
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,679
all of this test we just run the test

1270
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,839
and that's all we do

1271
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:30,318
we also have a very robust genetic

1272
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:34,078
data program where we

1273
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:35,279
we work with a lot of different breeders

1274
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,359
and growers

1275
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,960
and look at the diversity of their

1276
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,199
plants and we do different things to

1277
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,280
understand the genetics that underpin

1278
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,519
characteristics that those growers are

1279
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,560
really interested in whether it be

1280
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,199
flowering time or chemical production so

1281
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,679
we do have an active research

1282
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,318
side of the company but those research

1283
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,199
projects

1284
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,159
are separate from you're going to send

1285
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,439
me your plants

1286
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,000
to do gender id those plants don't cross

1287
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,240
over

1288
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,760
at all in our in our in our process

1289
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,959
so we have a very um you know very

1290
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,440
strict if you send us

1291
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,920
something to do a test on that's the

1292
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,480
only thing we do with that sample

1293
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,039
and because we have such a vested

1294
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,240
interest

1295
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,880
in really promoting

1296
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,639
the diversity that exists in the

1297
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,760
cannabis community and helping those

1298
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,279
individuals that have

1299
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,000
taken the time to not only develop all

1300
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,040
of these different

1301
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,599
plants but steward them and

1302
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:40,880
keep them safe and protected over the

1303
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,880
you know over the last decade

1304
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,838
we really work very very closely and

1305
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,759
very hard with

1306
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,679
organizations that have special plants

1307
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,160
to define those plants so that they

1308
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,519
can gain that intellectual property and

1309
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,399
so i think that's something

1310
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,119
that is confusing for a lot of people

1311
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,079
like what

1312
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,559
what is the intellectual property that i

1313
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,560
own

1314
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:06,960
as a grower or a breeder and and really

1315
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,119
any plant that's been in the community

1316
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,880
for more than a year

1317
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,640
you can't own and that for the most part

1318
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,318
is a really good thing

1319
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,559
um and i think if we were talking about

1320
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,318
any other plants everyone's like no you

1321
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,759
shouldn't own plants but then

1322
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:23,440
people get weird when they start talking

1323
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,480
about cannabis plants

1324
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,119
and there's this um there's this like

1325
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,400
different attitude about these plants

1326
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,318
and in order to really own a plant

1327
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,079
you have to have done a lot you have to

1328
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,920
have done work to breed something

1329
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,920
special and unique and the best way

1330
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,039
to define that is to define it in the

1331
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,079
way that we define

1332
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,000
all other plants which is to make

1333
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,640
herbarium pressings

1334
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,599
and write a botanical description that

1335
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,000
enumerates

1336
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,880
why that particular plant cultivar

1337
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,880
varietal

1338
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,960
is special and unique and what are the

1339
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,880
characteristics that make that plant

1340
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,880
special and unique and so

1341
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,000
when we take in plants to do cultivar

1342
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,160
registration

1343
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,159
that's exactly what we do we take those

1344
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,598
plants we work with candor to make

1345
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,598
herbarium pressings

1346
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,680
we do genetics that are then linked to

1347
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,280
those herbarium pressing so that there's

1348
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,358
something tangible

1349
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,960
to link those genetics to right genetics

1350
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,199
in a vacuum be nothing

1351
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,119
i think that's really important so you

1352
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,279
know if i go to my local dispensary and

1353
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,160
buy a pre-roll and then sequence it even

1354
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,880
if i'm the first

1355
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,679
one to sequence that plant it does not

1356
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,079
mean i own

1357
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,919
anything right like it's kind of like

1358
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,640
going to the store and deciding i'm

1359
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,200
gonna buy

1360
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,118
a gala apple and sequence it and then

1361
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,879
tell everyone that i own gala apples

1362
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,200
because i have the sequence of it i mean

1363
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,760
that

1364
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,598
doesn't really make much sense um but we

1365
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,800
have this idea that that's how you gain

1366
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,640
ownership of

1367
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,800
of plants in the cannabis realm and it's

1368
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:51,838
just it's a false

1369
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,519
it's a false promise that i think a lot

1370
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,199
of genetic organizations are giving to

1371
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,358
people the sequence data really means

1372
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,039
nothing especially because

1373
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,558
just like anything i mean we look at the

1374
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,079
sequence differences between

1375
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,920
chimps and humans and right we're almost

1376
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,280
the same at the sequence level

1377
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,800
and that is also true with the plants

1378
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,480
you have to really understand what is

1379
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,599
the phenotype that makes this plant

1380
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,800
different

1381
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,559
um and you have to describe that

1382
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,880
in order to gain any kind so the most

1383
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,280
important thing in gaining ip protection

1384
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,318
if you have something that is eligible

1385
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,760
is to do

1386
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:24,558
botanical description um the genetics

1387
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,800
are kind of uh

1388
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,160
the icing on the cake they're not you

1389
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,880
don't need you need the cake

1390
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,960
to do it you don't need the icing and so

1391
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,160
the genetics really just add value

1392
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,519
they're not the driver of any kind of ip

1393
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,078
application that you would do for a

1394
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,759
plant in general

1395
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,440
okay so let me try and yeah let me try

1396
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,400
and summarize my understanding of this

1397
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,720
and please correct me anywhere in here

1398
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,480
if i screw up so let's just say i'm a

1399
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,519
grower and i have a very special plant

1400
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,079
that i think

1401
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,920
is unique and i want to preserve it and

1402
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,359
have some love of ownership over it

1403
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,318
because of the amount of time and energy

1404
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,279
i put into breeding it

1405
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,000
so i would at this point need to reach

1406
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,000
out to a lab

1407
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,358
and it has to be a lab that i feel

1408
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,119
comfortable with and trust

1409
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,960
i'd want to read their genetic data

1410
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,358
policy so i know

1411
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,559
uh exactly what they're giving me and

1412
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,558
what i'm giving them

1413
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,400
in regards to information and plant

1414
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,000
material so

1415
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,400
that would be the start and then in

1416
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,480
order for that dna sequencing to have

1417
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,160
any value it has to be tied to

1418
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:30,400
an herbarium based on how

1419
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:34,318
we currently value or view ownership of

1420
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,639
plants so this is sort of unique to

1421
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,400
plants as i understand it and then at

1422
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,759
that point having those two things tied

1423
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,440
together

1424
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,040
and having this information from a lab

1425
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,079
would allow me to have some sort of

1426
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,480
legal framework

1427
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,519
around which to show that that i own

1428
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,280
this plant oh

1429
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,800
oh and this plant also has to have not

1430
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,519
been out in the world for more than a

1431
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,039
year

1432
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:58,000
publicly is that kind of covering that

1433
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,400
those are the rules yes for plants and

1434
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,159
and

1435
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,240
and plants you know plant ip is not um

1436
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,759
is not easy you in there you can get a

1437
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,358
plant patent in there you have to

1438
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,480
specifically show like how you've

1439
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,759
altered it

1440
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,838
um and it's generally for clonal

1441
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,800
type propagation and then if you have

1442
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,199
seeds and things

1443
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,240
you can get plant varietal protections

1444
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,838
which

1445
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,919
you know so there's different nuances

1446
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,719
and a lawyer is going to be able to

1447
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,760
really articulate those

1448
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,598
but the most fundamental aspect is

1449
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,119
really the plant is the botanical

1450
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,720
description so that's the same thing

1451
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,800
like we went off into

1452
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,399
some untarded territory and found a new

1453
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,760
orchid

1454
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,519
i think the first thing we're going to

1455
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,000
do when we find that new orchid or

1456
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,759
develop a new plant right just

1457
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,318
breathe a new cannabis plant it's the

1458
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,000
same thing so if you find this new plant

1459
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,159
or breed this new plant the first thing

1460
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,039
you do is do that botanical description

1461
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,799
to describe what it is that's always

1462
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,039
linked to a physical sample

1463
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,960
right so you you have to have a tangible

1464
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,880
thing to reference

1465
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,720
and then the genetics really are just

1466
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,000
the icing and the nice thing about the

1467
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:05,679
genetic work that we do

1468
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,119
with breeders is a lot of breeders want

1469
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,318
to then license their plants to

1470
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,079
different farms

1471
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,519
so they go through this process of

1472
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,119
writing these beautiful licensing

1473
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,318
agreements they pay a lawyer a lot of

1474
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,000
money and then

1475
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,519
they don't have any way to enforce that

1476
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,119
license

1477
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,880
and so the genetics that we do are

1478
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,440
really just a tool that then that

1479
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,358
breeder can utilize

1480
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,039
to audit you know they can they can

1481
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:28,400
audit their grower are you growing the

1482
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:30,000
right plants

1483
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,160
are you giving these plants to someone

1484
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,838
you shouldn't be now i can i can i

1485
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,519
can sample those plants and say oh wait

1486
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,519
these are my plants they shouldn't be

1487
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,679
here

1488
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:41,838
so you can really yeah that makes a lot

1489
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,519
of sense your contract

1490
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:45,920
instead you know so it's really just a

1491
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:50,239
tool it doesn't

1492
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,838
it's a valuable tool but it doesn't um

1493
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,439
it doesn't like give you anything just

1494
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:54,799
because you have the genetics right

1495
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,800
because

1496
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,200
anyone can sequence anything like

1497
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,000
there's no rules about that

1498
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,879
and around that note if someone sends

1499
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,079
you plant material

1500
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,160
you know we were talking a little bit

1501
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,519
before the podcast about this uh you

1502
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,078
mentioned this wasn't like a

1503
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:14,480
jurassic park situation where you can

1504
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,400
completely recreate this plant

1505
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,800
and then start you know growing and

1506
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,838
selling this plant yourself

1507
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,720
the the sequencing doesn't give you

1508
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:26,960
that kind of power um what what does it

1509
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,279
give you

1510
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,880
yeah so the sequencing gives you a

1511
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,079
couple things the first thing is really

1512
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,760
that like

1513
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,280
that tool kit it's really a bunch of

1514
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,079
tools so

1515
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,400
genetics gives you tools to track plants

1516
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,318
so

1517
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,838
in this licensing example to be able to

1518
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,400
track plants through a system

1519
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:46,239
or through different growers it also

1520
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,200
gives you the ability if you know that

1521
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,439
this plant

1522
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:50,799
smells like blueberries right you can

1523
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,280
then utilize

1524
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,760
genetics and compare some like compare

1525
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,760
10 plants that smell like blueberries

1526
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,440
to plants that don't smell like

1527
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,599
blueberries and then you can

1528
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,599
whittle down between that comparison

1529
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,318
what are those things that are driving

1530
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,240
the smell that you're interested in

1531
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,838
and so once you have those tools then

1532
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,199
you can look in

1533
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,440
and you have to have your own breeding

1534
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:16,639
stock right like you can't just recreate

1535
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,159
breeding stock with

1536
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,879
with genetics so if you have then you

1537
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,239
can use those genetic tools to screen

1538
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,559
your breeding stock

1539
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:25,919
to find things that are most likely to

1540
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,280
smell like blueberries if that's what

1541
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,680
you're after

1542
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,640
so it's really just a tool kit that can

1543
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,279
help

1544
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:35,039
facilitate and streamline breeding so

1545
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,240
that instead of having to

1546
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,079
grow a thousand plants and you know do

1547
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:41,838
the chemistry for all of them

1548
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,280
you can say oh out of these thousand

1549
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:45,759
plants these hundred are

1550
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,559
most likely to smell like blueberries

1551
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,520
i'm gonna grow

1552
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,960
them and focus on them and then you know

1553
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,559
breeding is iterative so you're gonna

1554
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,000
still have to do more work

1555
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,480
on those plants to get where you're

1556
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,719
going but what those genetics do

1557
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,800
is they give you a tool kit to make it

1558
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,598
easier

1559
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,039
so the big issue that people had uh with

1560
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,039
that company in oregon that was

1561
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,599
collecting

1562
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,159
people's plants and genetic information

1563
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,280
to create

1564
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:15,519
this uh collection was that

1565
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,119
as a breeder if i'm giving you a plant

1566
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,358
that i know is special and it's going to

1567
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,079
have these specific genetic markers

1568
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,880
that relate to its specialness whether

1569
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,400
that's

1570
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,079
resistance or thc levels or you know

1571
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,519
some synergistic effect of all the

1572
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,440
cannabinoids

1573
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,039
you know as some as a lab that's

1574
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,920
collecting all this information

1575
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,358
you can use the data you know you're

1576
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,960
getting a larger and larger data set

1577
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,558
over time to where you can start saying

1578
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,318
you know all of these plants

1579
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,400
that people are saying are special for

1580
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,679
this reason all have these same genetic

1581
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,480
markers

1582
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:48,879
i'm going to work with a breeder now and

1583
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,960
say

1584
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,960
hey we're going to breed until we get

1585
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,880
the same genetic markers and now

1586
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,519
we have an advantage over other growers

1587
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,400
because we can use this as an extra tool

1588
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,039
is that does that kind of summarize what

1589
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,480
what the

1590
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:06,079
the anger and frustration was associated

1591
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,838
with i think the anger and

1592
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,240
yeah absolutely and i think the anger

1593
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:14,239
and frustration really came from

1594
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:17,358
being duplicitous about the intent

1595
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:19,679
and um selling a product that was sold

1596
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,440
at or under cost not because you wanted

1597
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:22,159
to sell a product but because you wanted

1598
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,559
to gain

1599
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:25,759
genetic information right it's different

1600
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,960
when you're working with a breeder and

1601
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,240
you're saying oh we're going to do this

1602
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,679
project together

1603
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:31,358
and we're going to push your material

1604
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,838
forward and this is this is how we're

1605
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:35,759
working in synergy with one another

1606
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,519
that's a very different model then i'm

1607
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,720
gonna take all this information from

1608
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:43,920
individuals that may or may not want

1609
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:47,358
to help that cause and i'm gonna

1610
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,000
i'm gonna shift my i'm gonna shift my

1611
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:50,159
direction

1612
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,559
as an organization and at first i'm

1613
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:56,960
going to tell you that i'm doing

1614
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,480
i'm i'm asking genetic diversity for the

1615
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,519
greater good

1616
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,760
and then you're going to shift your

1617
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,599
business model into i'm going to be a

1618
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,680
producer of propagules and i'm going to

1619
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:09,039
compete with my customers

1620
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:12,078
yeah i think it's a tricky

1621
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:15,519
yeah it's about what you're doing

1622
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,280
and it's about um you know if you're a

1623
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,679
breeding organization

1624
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,760
that's fine but present yourself as a

1625
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,879
breeding organization

1626
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,799
and i think that's the issue is um

1627
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,039
like nobody likes to feel like they've

1628
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,318
been duped and nobody likes to feel like

1629
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,679
they're dealing with someone who's

1630
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:35,358
duplicitous in their

1631
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:37,279
intent and so i i feel like that's

1632
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:40,239
really where the anger came from

1633
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,680
um because no a lot of people would

1634
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,879
still work with you if you say this is

1635
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:44,879
what we're doing

1636
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,039
you just have to be like straightforward

1637
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,200
about what you're doing

1638
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:52,480
and with this particular organization i

1639
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:55,519
think the anger really came from

1640
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,599
saying a certain set

1641
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:02,318
of things in community settings

1642
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,680
and then saying a very different set of

1643
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,519
goals

1644
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:08,159
when it was coming time to talking to

1645
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:10,559
their board or their investors

1646
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:12,399
right like if you're whatever you say to

1647
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,240
whatever you're saying to anybody about

1648
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,880
the trajectory of an organization

1649
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,598
it should be the same no matter what

1650
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,200
room you're in

1651
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,200
if you're in the investor room or if

1652
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,439
you're in your client room or

1653
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:24,399
you're in a community room and i think

1654
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,760
that's the issue

1655
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,559
is um yeah it's just not being

1656
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,599
straightforward

1657
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,359
no one really likes that yeah i did an

1658
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,079
interview with reggie gaudino

1659
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,159
uh when he was with the cso at steep

1660
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,599
hill labs and he was very

1661
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,279
clear about the fact that they are

1662
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,200
collecting this data and

1663
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,480
you know what their potential plans were

1664
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,598
for it but he also said you know they

1665
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,679
could get bought out by

1666
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,280
dow at some point and that data might be

1667
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:50,239
used for something entirely different

1668
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,839
and

1669
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,598
that's something you need to be aware of

1670
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,119
and a risk associated with

1671
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,798
who you choose to work with but

1672
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,318
ultimately as a grower

1673
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:00,798
or breeder you're going to have to pick

1674
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,798
a lab at some point if you want to have

1675
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,960
this genetic information so it's a

1676
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:07,358
little bit of a catch-22 and

1677
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,559
for me this happened to me in my

1678
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,960
industry so

1679
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,559
my father did a lot of work in the

1680
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,079
infancy infancy around

1681
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,599
compost tea in terms of paying a lab to

1682
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,640
do a lot of testing around

1683
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,798
you know how does

1684
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,920
water quality affect what microbes are

1685
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,920
grown out in

1686
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,760
you know in our brewer or how does

1687
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,159
changing these designs affect the

1688
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,920
microbial diversity or the food sources

1689
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,679
you know is e coli able to grow in this

1690
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,079
in this brewer under these conditions so

1691
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,798
any

1692
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,400
you know spent oh tens of thousands of

1693
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,599
dollars on all this testing

1694
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,559
and then you know a few years later this

1695
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,359
particular lab

1696
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,400
started selling compost tea brewers and

1697
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,880
i was very

1698
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,400
very frustrated because all of us had

1699
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,838
been using this lab to do

1700
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,440
testing as sort of an independent

1701
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:55,199
resource and now we were competing

1702
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,200
directly with them and they had a huge

1703
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,838
advantage of having all of our tests and

1704
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,480
information

1705
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,599
so i completely understand that's the

1706
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,599
situation

1707
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,119
that happened and i think it's important

1708
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,240
like when you're looking for

1709
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,000
a genetic testing company what

1710
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:11,279
so one of the things i'm so proud of

1711
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,599
about leaf works is

1712
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,359
our core mission is to help individuals

1713
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,599
define the plants that are in community

1714
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:18,880
so it's doing cultivar registration

1715
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,200
and the more of those cult of our

1716
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,358
registrations we can do where we have

1717
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,039
vouchers and we have histories and we

1718
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,199
have breeding pedigrees

1719
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,039
what it does is it immortalizes those

1720
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:30,798
plants in the community such that they

1721
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,400
can't be stolen

1722
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,480
right you can't say that this is a

1723
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,760
unique plant that makes cbdn

1724
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,559
or whatever and all plants that make

1725
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,559
this chemical

1726
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,480
i now own with this utility patent i

1727
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,079
mean some of the utility pens that are

1728
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,838
being put out by some of the other

1729
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,039
genetic companies that everyone is

1730
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,000
working with

1731
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,039
are so super overreaching and if they

1732
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,679
would just look at

1733
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,558
the resource of the herbarium or would

1734
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:56,480
look at

1735
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,640
the cult of our registrations that

1736
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,159
leafworks is doing you would see oh

1737
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:04,318
that patent is actually in violation of

1738
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,440
you know all of is or is not appropriate

1739
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:07,519
and i think that's part of the

1740
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,639
problem if you don't have resources for

1741
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:12,318
patent

1742
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:14,719
lawyers who are you know looking over

1743
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:16,880
these applications to say that it's an

1744
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,039
overreaching

1745
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,720
patent like there's not the information

1746
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:21,920
you know you tell them this is the only

1747
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:24,879
plant that makes this

1748
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,480
this particular ratio of chemicals and

1749
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,000
they grant you that patent and then i

1750
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,440
have someone over here that has a plant

1751
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,838
that has a completely different

1752
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,838
evolutionary background is a different

1753
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,239
plant that makes the same

1754
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,119
pattern of chemicals like that would

1755
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,118
prove that that

1756
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,720
was you know that particular especially

1757
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,358
the utility patents

1758
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,639
should be you know vetoed should be

1759
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:46,239
thrown out

1760
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,759
and so we have we have a dearth of

1761
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:48,639
information and so that's one of the

1762
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,760
things that i'm

1763
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:55,279
so proud of leaf works for doing is

1764
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,520
the work that we do to define genetics

1765
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,880
helps to preserve and empower those

1766
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:00,639
people who have been holding those

1767
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,960
plants to be

1768
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:04,000
able to continue to use and breed with

1769
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,599
those plants

1770
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,519
so you can't have someone come in and

1771
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,359
say oh i own this plant now so you can't

1772
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,880
grow it anymore

1773
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:12,400
because we have proof that well you

1774
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,400
can't own it because this has been in

1775
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,039
community or this has been

1776
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,480
bred or this is a different version of

1777
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,159
the same thing you know whatever the

1778
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,760
story is that is gonna

1779
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,000
give the power to know that those plants

1780
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,520
are

1781
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,880
out there and that's part of the problem

1782
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,400
because we don't know what plants are

1783
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,960
out there you can have people say this

1784
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,680
is unique and special and i own it

1785
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,199
as opposed to you know there's these

1786
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:38,399
utility patents it's like

1787
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:42,719
um between two and five percent thc

1788
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,680
and between 12 and 16 cbg

1789
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,959
if it has that ratio i own it and it's

1790
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:48,719
like there's more than one

1791
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,960
evolutionary background that can produce

1792
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,279
that chemistry it's like

1793
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,079
but it's hard for for people who are

1794
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,000
assigning

1795
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:59,519
you know it's i i understand

1796
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,239
the patent lawyer right like that

1797
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:04,719
doesn't know exactly how to

1798
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,598
judge these patent applications so i

1799
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:07,679
think that we're gonna have a lot of

1800
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,559
things thrown out but

1801
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:12,078
um documenting what we have is one of

1802
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,920
the most important ways

1803
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,359
to make sure that we have access to our

1804
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,358
material long term

1805
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:18,880
okay so what you're saying is it's not

1806
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,279
so much about owning something

1807
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,720
but it's about keeping community access

1808
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,119
to it so

1809
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,358
other people are going to be collecting

1810
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:30,079
information and potentially trying to

1811
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,279
claim ownership over it but by having

1812
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,359
you know candor

1813
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,440
and leaf works doing this work

1814
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:36,159
potentially it allows the community to

1815
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,760
continue

1816
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:39,598
access to these plants without paying

1817
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,960
patents too so it's not about just

1818
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,880
having a special plant

1819
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,039
but it's about protecting our rights to

1820
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,240
all of this diversity and all these

1821
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,559
plants is that

1822
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,078
is that right absolutely okay that's

1823
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,760
interesting okay i never looked at it

1824
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,079
quite that way so

1825
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,119
yeah it's both sides right it's and i

1826
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,559
think the tomato

1827
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,240
community has a really good framework

1828
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,839
for this where you can breed tomatoes

1829
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:03,598
but we have a really good understanding

1830
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:04,239
of what tomatoes are out there and which

1831
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,280
ones

1832
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,239
have patent protection and which ones

1833
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,359
don't

1834
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,239
and if you breed something new you also

1835
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:15,679
have a way

1836
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,279
to articulate that it's new like the

1837
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,440
rose society is great like if i

1838
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,359
if i breed a new rose they have a

1839
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,599
registration of you know the thousands

1840
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:23,199
of

1841
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,039
rose cultivars that are out there and

1842
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:28,000
they can say oh guess what this one

1843
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,119
is unique you can give it its own name

1844
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,239
in its own

1845
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,838
you know story around it um and so

1846
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:34,719
that's another important thing you have

1847
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,679
to have this

1848
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,879
this reference in order to be able to

1849
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,000
articulate that it

1850
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,838
is something new and novel

1851
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,199
that's great well before we run out of

1852
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,599
time you know

1853
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,480
i wanted one of the questions i had i

1854
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,079
want to talk to you about was the

1855
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,159
advantages of

1856
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,000
gender testing so you offer gender

1857
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,838
testing you list in your

1858
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
genetic data policy that you destroy the

1859
01:03:55,838 --> 01:04:01,838
samples

1860
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,798
they're not associated with the uh

1861
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:06,159
the other aspects of your company around

1862
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,639
the research program

1863
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,078
so um can you talk a little bit about

1864
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:10,719
why someone might want to do gender

1865
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,318
testing

1866
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:17,598
in terms of an roi or the advantages

1867
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:20,798
around that yeah absolutely so

1868
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,680
if you are growing from seed there's a

1869
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:23,280
lot of different

1870
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,679
reasons why you'd want to do gender

1871
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,960
testing the first and foremost is of

1872
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:30,879
course you can know

1873
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,318
the sex of that plant seven to ten days

1874
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,000
after germination so as

1875
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:35,279
as soon as you can take a little tiny

1876
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,719
piece of that plant or a little piece of

1877
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,319
the cotyledon

1878
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:43,759
and not kill the plant you can know what

1879
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:45,519
what the sex is and that's great because

1880
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,880
depending on how you're growing in your

1881
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,000
growing style you can

1882
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,920
you generally save when we do our return

1883
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,719
on investment analysis

1884
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,440
you save between 20 and 30 percent on

1885
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,078
your

1886
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,720
on your grow based on not having to

1887
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,760
spend

1888
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:05,598
the time the way on the labor the

1889
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,760
materials of repotting and transplanting

1890
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,798
taking care of those plants until they

1891
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,680
show

1892
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,280
until they show their sex the other

1893
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,558
really great advantage is if you know

1894
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,400
which plants are girls and you're

1895
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,240
keeping only your girls then you can get

1896
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,160
them into their final resting spot

1897
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,598
earlier like their final pot and so you

1898
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,519
don't have this issue where

1899
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,880
you're like waiting for them to show and

1900
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,318
then they're getting root bound and so

1901
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,920
you just have healthier plants

1902
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,519
because they're getting into their spot

1903
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,960
earlier their roots are going to be

1904
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:32,480
healthier

1905
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,599
and healthy roots of course as we all

1906
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:38,079
know makes healthy plants

1907
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,440
the other thing that's really nice is

1908
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,359
you

1909
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,798
you know especially with organizations

1910
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:46,719
that have square footage requirements

1911
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:47,920
you really make sure you're using your

1912
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,159
space

1913
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,000
in the best way you're not using some of

1914
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:52,719
your space to grow boys that then you're

1915
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,559
gonna have to

1916
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,919
fill in with female plants after the

1917
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,839
fact so you're really

1918
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,200
maximizing the number of plants that you

1919
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:00,798
can get into your space that can be

1920
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,838
productive for you in your in your

1921
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:05,440
production

1922
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:06,880
um yeah and plant count numbers for

1923
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,400
people dealing with that too

1924
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:13,920
on the flip side medical grower um

1925
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,920
totally yeah it's so weird it's funny

1926
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,280
i have a couple groomers that say the

1927
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,680
funniest things like i have one

1928
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,559
swami i don't know if you know this um

1929
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,639
wonderful

1930
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,960
human but he said the funniest thing

1931
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:26,960
he's like i use you because i'm too old

1932
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,920
this excess plants and my eyes aren't

1933
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,199
good anymore

1934
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,159
i don't know if i can put that on the

1935
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:34,639
website but it was another reason why

1936
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,440
why someone is using them he's like i

1937
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:37,519
just have to

1938
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,639
he's like this is such a waste of time

1939
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:40,159
to have to walk around

1940
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,400
and look at those plants and then my

1941
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:45,038
eyes just can't always see them

1942
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,798
well enough so you know there's all

1943
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,200
kinds of reasons

1944
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,960
yeah i do see people all the time online

1945
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,798
asking you know is this a male

1946
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,280
is this a female and then you'll see a

1947
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:58,400
variety of answers a lot of times

1948
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,798
um underneath in the comments section uh

1949
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,920
and

1950
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:01,759
you know at that point you've already

1951
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,639
put in you know two three weeks into

1952
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,799
this plant

1953
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:05,759
uh so i think the time savings is the

1954
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:07,759
big one

1955
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,680
uh you know i'm so excited so we

1956
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,520
recently ordered some cards

1957
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:12,960
uh we are going to be offering them

1961
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:19,440
really excited to work with you guys on

1962

are interested

1966
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:29,358
in just listening to podcasts and might

1967
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:33,038
want to know more ranges

1968
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:35,679
it looks like from 10 to 15 a plant

1969
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,359
um you have a card the minimum would be

1970
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:39,199
four plants so you're looking at sixty

1971
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:40,880
dollars to try it out can you talk about

1972
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:41,679
what the process is for someone who

1973
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,039
receives a kit

1974
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:46,879
in the mail absolutely yeah so we do

1975
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,880
have variable pricings if you're doing

1976
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,000
it at scale we of course want to help

1977
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,000
you out and

1978
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,400
it helps us out to be able to to do it

1979
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,440
in bulk and so we give you a discount on

1980
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,519
on bulk orders and when you're receiving

1981
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,559
um your kit what you get is a collection

1982
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,239
card

1983
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,920
and on that collection card you're going

1984
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:04,879
to take a little tiny piece of that

1985
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,039
plant and you're going to

1986
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,440
press and squish i like to actually use

1987
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,319
the back of a sharpie marker to rub

1988
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,798
back and forth over that card to really

1989
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:16,079
press

1990
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:18,479
that plant material onto the card and

1991
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,838
all that juice is really going to soak

1992
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:23,439
into that

1993
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,000
special paper that dna sticks to and it

1994
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:26,399
breaks down

1995
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,158
proteins and then you just send that

1996
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,679
card back to us and what we do is we

1997
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,039
just take a little punch of the card and

1998
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,759
just do a

1999
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:34,798
simple test and we use multiple markers

2000
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,838
which is really nice and that's

2001
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,039
something that's unique

2002
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:42,559
about our are sexing

2003
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:45,198
is that we have five markers across

2004
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,560
the y chromosome that we look for

2005
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:48,318
instead of just using one

2006
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,920
most um all of our competitors are just

2007
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,640
using a single marker

2008
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,640
and that's important because not all

2009
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,199
males have all of the markers

2010
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,319
we have a lot of diversity in cannabis

2011
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,639
as we talked about

2012
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,679
and so we really wanted to make sure

2013
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,440
that we

2014
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,279
offered the most robust tests and we

2015
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,960
weren't missing any males and that's why

2016
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,440
it was really important for us to have

2017
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,279
multiple markers that were spread out

2018
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,399
across that y chromosome so

2019
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,920
we never missed anybody and so we take

2020
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,479
in that card we take a little piece that

2021
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,880
paper

2022
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,158
we do that essay and then we let you

2023
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,520
know via email

2024
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:27,198
um which plants with which tags are

2025
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,199
um male and female

2026
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:32,000
great that makes it really easy um

2027
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,520
you know when i first started looking

2028
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,479
into this and

2029
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,920
wanting to offer a gender id kit uh you

2030
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,119
know you go online and you see other

2031
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,000
kits that are

2032
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:43,599
less expensive and then i think you were

2033
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,399
the one actually that had to explain to

2034
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,039
me that

2035
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:49,679
uh you know those kits you actually have

2036
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:52,079
to have a lab or other tools in order to

2037
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,920
really process them can you touch on

2038
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:57,198
that yeah

2039
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,960
yeah so um you can buy a i guess there's

2040
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:01,359
one that's like five dollar sample but

2041
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,198
you have to actually have a pcr machine

2042
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,519
and you have to do the work yourself you

2043
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:08,559
actually have to do all of the

2044
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:12,400
the lab work which of course requires

2045
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,760
a 15 to 40 000 machine and a person that

2046
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:15,439
knows how to do pcr

2047
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,159
and a whole bunch of pipe headers to be

2048
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:20,479
able to do the pcr which are you know

2049
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:24,319
several hundred dollars each and so

2050
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:27,519
unless you're really you know

2051
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:31,279
equipped to put a whole lab on your

2052
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,360
farm it's not really the cheap

2053
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:34,319
solution that you think that you think

2054
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:35,920
it is

2055
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,238
um because you do need all the

2056
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,399
infrastructure in order to be able to do

2057
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,519
the test itself

2058
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:42,799
that's great yeah that was just

2059
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,600
something you know when you do a quick

2060
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,840
google search

2061
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,760
it's not very clear the difference is

2062
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,880
there yeah i just wanted to mention that

2063
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,400
for people

2064
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,159
well i appreciate that because it's

2065
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:53,759
funny it's like oh but we can do this

2066
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:56,000
for five dollars it's like yeah but do

2067
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,679
you have a pcr machine

2068
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,198
yeah and like how many of them you have

2069
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,760
to do and if you were like oh i'll buy a

2070
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:05,359
pizza like well you have to do

2071
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,520
500 000 of these to break even now

2072
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:08,639
so you know it depends on you know if

2073
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,480
your farm that's doing that

2074
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,079
it might be worth it but i don't think

2075
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:16,238
that everyone is at the scale

2076
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:19,679
where it it breaks it breaks the

2077
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:21,439
i don't know it breaks even very easily

2078
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,359
yeah so for people that want just the

2079
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:24,000
gender id this is a great way to do it

2080
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,279
um

2081
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,238
what what is the process for someone who

2082
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:30,719
wants to

2083
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:31,599
be more involved with uh you know the

2084
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,760
cultivar

2085
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,920
registration side of things what does

2086
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,440
that process look like

2087
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,880
so this is a wonderful thing so if

2088
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:39,759
you're a breeder you have a special

2089
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,239
plant

2090
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,079
you can do a cultivar registration on

2091
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:46,319
your plant but if you hold

2092
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,238
like we have also individuals that hold

2093
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:49,759
these immense collections

2094
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,238
so they're not breeders they just have

2095
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,400
had these plants for a long time

2096
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,238
and we also do cultivar registrations

2097
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:57,920
for them where we take in the plant we

2098
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:00,959
do the botanical description

2099
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:03,760
and we then take it and look at our

2100
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,679
other reference material to make sure

2101
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,119
that if they say it's plant a it is in

2102
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,760
fact plant a

2103
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,039
and this has been really um good for a

2104
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,199
lot of reasons if you

2105
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,800
are you know a breeder it makes sense

2106
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:16,399
that you're defining your material and

2107
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,279
you're getting all those ducks in a row

2108
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,158
to really

2109
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:22,158
have the documentation you need together

2110
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:22,960
if you're a collector it's also a really

2111
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:25,359
good way

2112
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,039
to understand the plants you have

2113
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:29,198
especially if you're someone who grows

2114
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,960
plants in multiple locations

2115
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,559
those cultivar registrations and that

2116
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,520
process can really help you

2117
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,679
understand like let's say of three farms

2118
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,040
which farm is the best to grow what

2119
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,640
plant

2120
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,960
and so there's a lot of additional

2121
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,960
benefits and that sort of plays in and

2122
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,920
dovetails into a lot of the work that

2123
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,800
is is coming into the epilatory

2124
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,359
frameworks that are happening around

2125
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,840
not only california but are um starting

2126
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:58,639
to

2127
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,760
to percolate in other states as well

2128
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,079
and so that that cult of our

2129
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,679
registration is really a

2130
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:06,319
a great way of documenting the plants

2131
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,039
you have

2132
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,000
and being able to leverage that

2133
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:13,679
information to

2134
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,439
the best use for your organization

2135
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,880
yeah i'm looking at this page right now

2136
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:18,238
and it's pretty interesting the amount

2137
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,039
of information you get about a

2138
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:22,479
particular

2139
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:24,399
cultivar what would i so two questions

2140
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:26,639
one what would i send you in order for

2141
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:30,319
you to do this service

2142
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,719
and then two in regards to this service

2143
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:34,319
i see you don't have any pricing are you

2144
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,679
able to give a range of sort of what

2145
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:36,000
something like this might cost or is

2146
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,560
that

2147
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,079
uh yeah something definitely yeah no i

2148
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,840
definitely can so if you're registering

2149
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:45,119
a single plant it's

2150
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,039
5 500 to do a single plant and if you're

2151
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:47,760
doing multiple plants that price goes

2152
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:51,840
down

2153
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:54,400
we visit the farm or we send you

2154
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,560
a kit such that you can do the herbarium

2155
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:58,879
portion yourself

2156
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,039
and making the pressings and then we

2157
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,760
have our staff botanist

2158
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,519
take that information and write that

2159
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,360
botanical description

2160
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,360
we take in pedigree history and we do

2161
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:11,599
all of those um

2162
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,359
those aspects of the registration and

2163
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,640
basically present to you and you know we

2164
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,479
do the genetics

2165
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,440
link those together and then we present

2166
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:18,718
to you it's almost like a little

2167
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:23,519
magazine

2168
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:27,039
that pulls all that information together

2169
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:30,239
and is this little

2170
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:32,479
document that you have

2171
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,000
in order you know to share about the

2172
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,959
plant itself

2173
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,238
um with other people customers other

2174
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,600
other people who maybe want to grow your

2175
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:41,919
plant if you're a breeder

2176
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,920
and then it also gives you that tool set

2177
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,319
with the genetics that are linked so

2178
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,440
that if you have any additional

2179
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:52,719
utility you can utilize those tools to

2180
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:54,719
let you know track your plants um

2181
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,719
articulate what's interesting about them

2182
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,399
you can use it if you are going the ip

2183
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,480
route with your lawyer as part of your

2184
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,238
docket

2185
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:06,158
all of those components can then be

2186
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:07,919
utilized for those purposes as well

2187
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:09,519
yeah i highly suggest that people go

2188
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,359
onto the leafworks website and

2189
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,520
look at the cultivar registration page

2190
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:15,679
just because it's a really interesting

2191
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,840
the way like you said it's almost like a

2192
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:20,960
little magazine about the

2193
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,960
about that particular plant in this case

2194
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,560
your example is a pistachio chai

2195
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,319
it's just kind of interesting to read so

2196
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,159
even if you don't ever plan on yeah

2197
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,559
registering a plant it's just kind of an

2198
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:32,238
interesting thing to look at

2199
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,840
yeah and the nice thing is where this is

2200
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:37,279
going and so let's say we've

2201
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,000
registered pistachio chai and now i'm an

2202
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:40,960
extract maker

2203
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,079
and i'm buying pistachio chai flour from

2204
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,880
a farm

2205
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:46,880
i can now take my flour and send it into

2206
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,079
leaf works and verify that i have the

2207
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,600
plant i say i have

2208
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:52,238
that i can put a little leafwork

2209
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,880
certified feel on my

2210
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:55,279
product whether it be you know vape pen

2211
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,079
or

2212
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:59,679
some rosin or any other kind of product

2213
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,719
so that then i can convey to my

2214
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,480
customers

2215
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,640
exactly what's in that label and so

2216
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:08,158
we're really moving towards

2217
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,480
bringing cannabis into the fold

2218
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:11,759
and and treating it just like we do the

2219
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,198
other plants such that

2220
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,000
you know especially if i'm a product

2221
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:18,479
maker that's one step away from the farm

2222
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,319
it's a way that i can have assurance

2223
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,559
that i'm getting the flower i i think

2224
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:23,920
i'm getting i can have some assurance

2225
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,679
through a third party

2226
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,520
that you know not only is it the flower

2227
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,640
i think it is but it's not you know

2228
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,480
cut with trim from something else and

2229
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,480
then i can also convey that to my

2230
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:36,000
customers and you know as we get

2231
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,839
just like we were talking about earlier

2232
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,600
as we get more and more refined

2233
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,719
in our own consumer

2234
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,679
desires being able to really articulate

2235
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:48,239
what plant is

2236
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,440
in the product and having the customer

2237
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:50,879
have confidence that they're really

2238
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,719
getting what they want

2239
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,960
it's going to be beneficial for everyone

2240
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,840
so let's say that i've made

2241
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,960
a pre-roll with a certain plant

2242
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,840
potassium chai

2243
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,000
and then you have made this beautiful

2244
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,239
extract

2245
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
if i know i like pistachio chai and i

2246
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:08,238
see these two products they both are

2247
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,760
leaf beef work certified it is that

2248
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:12,238
plant in the product

2249
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,679
i'm more likely to buy your product

2250
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:14,639
because i know i'm going to like the

2251
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,800
plant

2252
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,920
and so what it does is it gives this

2253
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,079
confidence

2254
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,158
and it's a confidence that's then shared

2255
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,079
between brands and so it increases the

2256
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:27,759
brand equity because you know

2257
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,760
that that label means something

2258
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:36,079
so along along those lines

2259
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:39,840
i assume um it's a lot less expensive

2260
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:41,359
to do uh a check on a plant than it is

2261
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,560
to do this whole registration what does

2262
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:45,279
something like that cost

2263
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,560
if if you wanted to just you know check

2264
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:47,599
to see if the genetics match what you

2265
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,880
thought they did

2266
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,719
of something you'd already yeah so just

2267
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,079
doing a double check

2268
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,480
yeah so a plant double check is 250

2269
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:58,640
for a single double check and then of

2270
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,238
course if you're doing a excuse me if

2271
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,360
you're doing a bunch of double checks

2272
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:06,479
we we sell those in bulk as well okay

2273
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,839
and then if i did go down this let's say

2274
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:10,158
as a grower you want to do this cultivar

2275
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,640
registration is there any risk

2276
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:13,279
of you know potentially losing that

2277
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,239
plant

2278
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:17,840
to the lab like could you take what you

2279
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,519
are collecting and somehow

2280
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:23,199
grow out this plant through tissue

2281
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,199
culture or some other methodology

2282
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:29,678
um no we yeah we just the only access we

2283
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,238
ever have to the plant is through the

2284
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:35,359
herbarium and it's dried plant material

2285
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:36,559
so you can't really do anything with

2286
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:40,479
that other than

2287
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:43,600
reference it um long term so you can't

2288
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:47,519
tissue culture it you can't grow it up

2289
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,840
um if anything what it is is it's a

2290
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,880
it's a immutable reference that you can

2291
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,480
point to

2292
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,400
to make sure no one else is stealing

2293
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,399
your stuff

2294
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:57,679
okay and then last question for you is

2295
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,759
there any way to view

2296
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,719
some of these registrations like to wait

2297
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,640
and know that like if

2298
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,079
what i'm trying to create as a as a

2299
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,920
certified reference material has already

2300
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,359
been created or

2301
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,279
uh if there's something yeah well you

2302
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:10,960
can always contact yeah you can always

2303
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:13,279
contact leafworks right now

2304
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,039
um we've been talking about how to

2305
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:17,279
present that in a more

2306
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,640
user-friendly way and that requires a

2307
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:23,759
lot of web

2308
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:26,079
um web design alteration as maybe

2309
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,119
maybe yeah so that's something that

2310
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,279
we're talking about

2311
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:31,198
um we've done quite a bit of work with

2312
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,399
the humboldt seed company and their

2313
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:36,000
plants

2314
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:38,238
um mostly we're working with them on

2315
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,600
doing feminized feed certification so

2316
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:41,599
people who really want to know that

2317
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,079
they're buying feminized seeds

2318
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,719
that certification is important to them

2319
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,279
and so

2320
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,800
we um that's probably the first thing

2321
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,719
we're going to put up as a

2322
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:53,119
list of referenceable lists so you can

2323
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:55,359
see um which cultivars from which

2324
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:58,000
organizations have been certified

2325
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:59,039
um with the feminized seed sir and then

2326
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,600
as we do that we'll

2327
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:03,198
we'll grow into adding those cultivar

2328
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,079
registrations but you know it's this

2329
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:07,279
weird

2330
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:08,158
