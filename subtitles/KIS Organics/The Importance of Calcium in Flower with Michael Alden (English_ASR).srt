1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,359
uh my my labmate Melissa Muno uh she did

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,799
her doctor at work with calcium sprays

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,000
and different um pesticide sprays for

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,160
pres preventing a Bettis on Rose I think

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,559
Gerber Daisy and something else um and

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,839
so what she found is that if you spray

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,960
calcium onto the flour tissue it can

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:25,439
help reduce petrius infection and so we

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,039
wanted to try that with cannabis right

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,640
uh the issue was that by the time you

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,920
were spraying it by the time you

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,960
actually have these welldeveloped

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,960
inflorescences and they're kind of in

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,039
that time where petrius can start

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,079
infecting and becoming a problem it's

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,878
too late to be applying calcium you

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,039
can't really get it into the flowers

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,359
like you can with a rose and you know

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,079
the way you do it with a rose is that

20
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,600
you just turn it upside down you dunk it

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,600
into a solution of calcium you can't do

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,079
that with a cannabis plant right um and

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,039
so the idea instead is that what we need

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,679
to do is that you can't really spray

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,640
late into flour what you need to be

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,640
doing is providing higher calcium and

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,558
potentially silica right from the start

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,560
of flowering or even beforehand and

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,798
maintain very very high concentrations

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,719
of calcium and silica in the plant to

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,280
potentially reduce petritis we don't

32
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,599
have data for that or anything but what

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,519
we know for sure is that spraying either

34
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,839
pesticides or calcium late in flowering

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,839
does nothing
