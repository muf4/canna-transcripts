1
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,919
so i see folks posting photos all the

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,480
time in

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,400
facebook groups or on instagram or they

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
send me photos saying hey what's going

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,880
on in my garden and a lot of times i

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,480
can't tell from the photo

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,800
what is going on in the picture it's too

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
blurry and unfortunately our cell phones

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,000
just don't work well for macro

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,439
photography so

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,599
i've been using this dyno light for

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,719
years we carry it on our website it's

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,480
going to run you about two to three

14
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,320
hundred dollars delivered

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,000
they're depending on the resolution that

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
you want

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,238
but it is really the gold standard when

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,079
it comes to these usb microscopes they

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,919
it works really really well

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
here's an image of an aphid that i took

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,719
today uh just to give you an idea of the

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,920
quality and i want to do a comparison uh

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,359
because

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
you know it all starts with a good

25
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,679
identification but people are like i

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520
don't have you know 200 300 to spend on

27
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,399
a microscope which i totally understand

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,879
so

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,799
suzanne wainwright evans my my dear

30
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,358
friend the bug lady

31
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,399
recently recommended to a group uh for

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,879
an affordable wi-fi digital microscope

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,118
this one from amazon this was 30 for

34
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,798
prime day and i wanted to give you guys

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,400
a little comparison so you can kind of

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,760
see the pros and cons because there were

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
definitely some things i came across

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,600
with this microscope

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
that i really didn't like and then there

40
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,359
were some other things that pretty much

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,200
blew me away in terms of quality so

42
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,200
uh let's get let's dive into it so

43
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,280
really quickly it's a wireless

44
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,199
microscope it hooks up via a wi-fi

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,879
connection which has its pros and cons

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,799
and i'll show you how that process looks

47
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,959
here in a second

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,360
you have your on off button here

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,118
led adjustment it's quite bright and

50
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,118
then this is just like a dyno light this

51
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,438
is how you focus the light

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,799
or sorry focus the image that you're

53
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,319
looking at

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,240
and then you have a digital zoom

55
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,679
additionally here on the back

56
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,879
as well it comes with a nice little

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
stand

58
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,478
and probably the coolest thing it comes

59
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,239
with is this cover i don't understand

60
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,840
why dinolight doesn't send these covers

61
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,280
with their lights it's a really really

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
nice feature

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,680
i have to keep my dyno light in the bag

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
in order to keep dust out of it

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
suzanne i think even puts like a ziploc

66
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,598
baggie around it too to keep the

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,360
microscope lens clean

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,399
it does come with a stand dynolite

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
charges extra for this however the stand

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
i don't really use the stand anyway

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,360
but the stand did fit for the dyno light

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,680
too so just something to be aware of and

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,879
then here's my charger it's a pretty

74
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,400
standard charging adapter connection

75
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,518
takes about three hours to charge they

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,039
say how long it lasts on a charge i

77
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,039
don't know i just haven't used it long

78
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,280
enough yet but let's go ahead and dive

79
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,280
into the microscope itself and then

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,000
compare some images and talk about the

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
pros and cons

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,080
okay so i went ahead and stole my wife's

83
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,680
phone and downloaded this mac c app onto

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
it so i can record and show you what's

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
going on at the same time

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,759
uh one thing about this phone is it does

87
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,598
require you connect through wi-fi so i

88
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,359
actually have to go to my wi-fi settings

89
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,719
here it doesn't take you to the right

90
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,800
location but takes you close um it'll go

91
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,080
in here and in order to see the wi-fi

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
network that i need i actually need to

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,319
turn the light on here so

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
let's turn it on you'll see the led

95
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,560
light comes on

96
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,239
and uh one thing i found is it's it's

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
pretty good in that regard like usually

98
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,120
pretty quickly here that wi-fi network

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,360
will show up there it is so max c

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,080
now we're connected to it

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,599
if we go back to the app itself now we

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,840
have an image

103
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,759
and you can see that's the image of this

104
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,759
cover which is a really nice feature

105
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,000
that it comes with that cover

106
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,759
snap the cover off here

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
drop it down here you can see now i'm

108
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,919
recording

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,319
or

110
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:48,399
magnifying this wood table um now a

111
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,479
couple things about this uh about this

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
in terms of user user ability that's

113
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,039
really nice now if i'm in a in a

114
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,640
outside or in a grow room it's kind of

115
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,639
nice that i don't have a cord to deal

116
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,318
with i don't have to be right next to my

117
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,238
phone

118
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,798
those are all really nice features and

119
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
then also over here you can zoom in and

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,719
zoom out

121
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,479
so if i want to zoom in

122
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,000
there you go i can see it goes up to two

123
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,798
times there

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,798
and then i can adjust just like with the

125
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,120
dynolite i adjust my

126
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,358
uh magnification

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,840
and resolution over here and

128
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,719
the the dyno light actually has two

129
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,959
levels of zoom that will focus this one

130
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,320
only has one so once you're in focus

131
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,000
you're kind of you're kind of there

132
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,839
that's the image

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
so a little bit of a little bit less

134
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,638
quality there

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,879
also if i want to take a video i have to

136
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,800
click over here on video

137
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,319
and now it's recording a video you can

138
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,199
only way you can know that is by looking

139
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,199
up here in the corner

140
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,319
so that's not quite as as easy as on a

141
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,918
dyno light either

142
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,759
and then the resolution i can adjust

143
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,719
right here i can also rotate the image

144
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,919
180 degrees and then i can snap photos

145
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,560
on here or i can snap photos on here

146
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,120
either will take a picture of the image

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
and i can go back to my photos library

148
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
and see

149
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,759
now

150
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
with the dyno light

151
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,759
you have this really intuitive button

152
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,279
here now yes i can take photos directly

153
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
on my computer

154
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,758
but it's much easier to just click this

155
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,839
little button here to start a video or

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,319
start a photo and so in that regard i

157
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,000
think the dynolite wins as well as in

158
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,680
the zoom but let's look at the actual

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,439
quality of this camera and see if this

160
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
is something that will work for folks

161
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,199
who just need a picture of an insect to

162
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,038
send off her id or for scouting in their

163
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,080
room they're not really interested in

164
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,240
getting that super high resolution so

165
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,800
let's compare the two

166
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,960
so here's the video of the wi-fi digital

167
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,400
microscope

168
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,959
as you can see here the quality is

169
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,638
pretty good you can see the aphid itself

170
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,638
crawling around on the leaf i went ahead

171
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,680
and went with video instead of a photo

172
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,400
because

173
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
the

174
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,038
image quality is going to look exactly

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
the same i compared them and

176
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,318
so you do get a high quality photo or

177
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
image and then it does have this digital

178
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,680
zoom where you can push these buttons on

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,038
the back to zoom in or out using the

180
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,360
digital

181
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,199
ability and you can get quite close and

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
get a pretty good image so overall i'm

183
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,478
pretty happy with the resolution on this

184
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,318
camera

185
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,639
i'll save some of the negatives for my

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,879
little summary at the end here

187
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,519
but the image pretty good now compared

188
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,240
to the dyno light here which is is now

189
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,839
on the screen you can see the dino light

190
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
this is the exact same leaf by the way

191
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,318
just a different section with more

192
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,879
aphids

193
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,039
allows you to have that second layer of

194
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,600
optical zoom so much higher quality i

195
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,599
can zoom in on the cornicle there or

196
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,360
now i can see the head of the aphids and

197
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,160
a bunch of aphids here crawling around

198
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
so

199
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
again you get what you pay for in terms

200
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,638
of the lens quality

201
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,400
with the light so i'm really really

202
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
still happy with it overall

203
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,839
okay so let's summarize the difference

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,279
between these two microscopes you know

205
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,519
with this dyno light i'm going to be

206
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,279
paying more but the image quality is

207
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,120
going to be much much higher

208
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,239
it's going to have customer service and

209
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
support

210
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,038
it's going to have updates it's

211
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
it's with a good company and i've worked

212
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,000
with them now personally and i'm really

213
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,879
happy with it

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
but

215
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,800
it is expensive and you're paying for

216
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,240
that quality now this

217
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,918
this light on amazon this microscope um

218
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,439
let's talk about some of the cons i

219
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,680
showed you guys the image and again it's

220
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,038
pretty good but there are some cons that

221
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,360
go along with it too and things need to

222
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,879
be aware of so one

223
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,680
i originally took some images and i

224
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,759
didn't want to share my wife's photos

225
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
with the app and

226
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,199
i thought i could just

227
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,080
share selected photos it didn't actually

228
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,680
take any photos or videos until i shared

229
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,279
all my photos

230
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
i thought i was recording photos i

231
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,038
wasn't recording any photos

232
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,038
and then i thought i would send those

233
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,399
photos to

234
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:59,839
from her phone to either my macbook or

235
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,318
to my phone via airdrop or

236
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,000
email or even dropbox and i wasn't able

237
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,840
to do any of that

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it won't let me share the videos it'll

239
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,079
let me show the photos so if i want to

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,519
just snap a photo in a grow room really

241
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,439
quickly and send that photo off to

242
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,560
someone i absolutely can but if i take a

243
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,598
video

244
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,360
the only way that i found i was able to

245
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:24,079
share the video was to take it

246
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,439
add it to my iphone library

247
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:30,719
on my computer and then drag and drop it

248
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,719
onto the desktop and then take that file

249
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,839
and that file was then shareable i have

250
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,839
no idea why um it actually my wife's

251
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,320
phone during all of this ended up

252
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,719
getting stuck with only siri working and

253
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
i couldn't even do a reset until i did a

254
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,399
force quit on the whole phone i don't

255
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,439
know if that was related to this either

256
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
but it seemed glitchy

257
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,320
so

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
i'm not i wasn't too excited about that

259
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
you know now since i have both how often

260
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
will i be using this one um well i'll

261
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,799
lend this one out to friends and family

262
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
and things like that um it's

263
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,000
the advantage of is it's really portable

264
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,839
if i break it i'm not going to be

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,519
heartbroken for 30 bucks and

266
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,920
um if i'm out in the field and i want to

267
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,278
snap some quick photos this is really

268
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,639
nice i don't need my laptop and

269
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,480
everything like i do with this dyno

270
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,559
light for a setup so

271
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,159
again there are some pros and cons to it

272
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,000
but um

273
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,519
because i really like taking high

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
quality photos i'll probably be using my

275
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
dino light more but if you're a grower

276
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,519
you want something quick you're not too

277
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
concerned about the privacy issues or

278
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,399
some of the glitchiness or necessarily

279
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,080
being able to share the videos um

280
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
this might work great for you so you can

281
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
check it out i'll put a link in

282
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
the comment section there for folks who

283
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,720
wanted a direct link to it to buy it um

284
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,800
i do just full disclosure i do sell dino

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,879
lights i think i mentioned the video so

286
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,319
i do have a relationship with them

287
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,838
i know nothing about the company that

288
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,600
makes these uh there's just something

289
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,399
that suzanne put up so

290
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,759
uh happy growing guys remember identify

291
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
your pests that's the most important

292
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,439
thing before we take any steps or action

293
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,879
in terms of application or pesticides or

294
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
anything you always have to start with a

295
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,240
positive id so alright

296
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
take care
