welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

4
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,879
science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussey

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,800
of Kiss Organics

6
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,480
the podcast where we discuss The Cutting

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,519
Edge of growing from a science-based

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,960
perspective and drawn top experts from

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,278
around the industry to share their

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,679
wisdom and knowledge

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,140
my guest this week is Dr Wendy Zellner

12
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,780
Dr Zellner received her doctorate from

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,340
the University of Toledo in 2012 where

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,739
she trained in molecular and cellular

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,780
biology focusing on the role of silicon

16
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,299
and plant defense responses

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,299
upon graduation she pursued a four-year

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,399
postdoctoral position with the USDA ARS

19
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,679
where she continued studying the role of

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,920
silicon and alleviating both abiotic and

21
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,659
biotic stress in tomato and tobacco her

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,579
current studies are to design standard

23
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,798
methods for quantifying the uptake of

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,299
silicon from fertilizer material in

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,939
addition to identifying uptake

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,740
mechanisms for silicon in model species

27
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,000
and testing for similar Pathways and

28
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,798
other crops

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,719
I learned a ton from Wendy in this

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,240
podcast and it got me excited to do more

31
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,500
plant trials utilizing silicon so in

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,539
conjunction with the release of this

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,159
podcast we are offering discounts on the

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,159
two main silica products that we carry

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,500
at kiss Organics egg cell 16h and will

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,118
last a night for a limited time now on

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,719
to the show hi Wendy thanks for coming

38
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:32,719
on the show today

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,700
good afternoon how are you doing

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,399
well thank you for having me yeah

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,520
wonderful I'm so excited this is a topic

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,320
that I've been wanting to cover for a

43
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,859
very long time but it is shockingly

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:53,279
difficult to find a true resource and

45
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,259
expert on Silicon so tell me a little

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,840
bit about yourself and uh we'll start

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,560
there

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,880
okay

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
um I

50
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,280
um am from Northwest Ohio born and

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,920
raised in the midwest I didn't come from

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,520
an agriculture background but always had

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,620
a love for nutrition and disease and

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,379
really started to get into Plant

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,259
Nutrition in high school and then in

56
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:22,799
college really got into the cellular

57
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:25,459
molecular aspects of things and so I was

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,939
fortunate enough after

59
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:33,598
graduation to get a position with USDA

60
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:37,500
ARS where I was able to study the role

61
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,899
of silicon and disease in a much broader

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,580
sense where I was exposed to the

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,159
Horticulture and floor culture industry

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,200
and it was really as we've been

65
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,180
exploring this seeing how important

66
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,419
silicon is as a plant nutrient

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,959
especially with how it pertains to plant

68
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,639
Health really pushed me to pursue it

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,759
even further and so I've been really

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,518
active with different regulatory bodies

71
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,979
and different groups to really get the

72
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,900
correct education of silicon out there

73
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:08,818
and what it is and how to use it

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,400
correctly

75
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,399
that's that's wonderful I I know you've

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,200
done a number of podcasts now there's a

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
lot of resources if people Google your

78
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,000
name

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
um

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
for this podcast I want to lay a little

81
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,360
bit of a foundation before we dive into

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,039
the real uh you know meet of the topic

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,019
here so can you start off telling us

84
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,500
just a little bit about what what is

85
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,500
silicon

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:38,818
definitely so silicon as an element

87
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,680
um we've refer to it as silicon it is uh

88
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,378
the second most available or the second

89
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,860
most abundant element that's in our

90
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:49,919
soils the problem is the amounts that we

91
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,319
need for plant uptake is very very low

92
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,938
fraction of that so

93
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,280
with that

94
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:58,979
um as we've been growing plants in soil

95
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,098
or as we have them in soilless media and

96
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,199
hydroponic system the amount of the

97
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:07,378
plant available silicon that's there is

98
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,139
actually really really low and just like

99
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:14,399
any other nutrient it has specific uses

100
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,858
by different plants so with that we've

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,899
really been trying to understand why

102
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,279
plants take up the amount of silicon

103
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,079
that they have and what they're actually

104
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,179
using the element for and so there's a a

105
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,339
couple different terms for silicon that

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,019
are kind of thrown out there so when we

107
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,879
talk about silicon we're talking about

108
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:37,680
the element then we have the silicates

109
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,620
which is usually when it's associated

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,139
with something like calcium or potassium

111
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,680
salicylic acid is the plant available

112
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:50,220
form and then you have other forms of

113
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,620
silicon like silicone which is used in

114
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,520
other Industries and so what's really

115
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,680
interesting about this element is we use

116
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,779
it in our everyday life we use it for

117
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,860
things like electronics for abrasives

118
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:06,839
and toothpaste for

119
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,780
Cosmetics additives even for our own

120
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,698
health people take silicon supplements

121
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:16,619
for their hair the nails cartilage

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:19,259
reduce wrinkles so this nutrient we have

123
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,379
been taking advantage of both in our

124
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,939
physical life and our health life and

125
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,360
the plants do with the same thing and

126
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:30,719
we've all evolved to use this highly

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,960
abundant element in different ways and

128
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,479
so really everything that we're trying

129
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,819
to educate on Silicon all of this

130
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,258
knowledge has been present in the

131
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,500
literature and we've known about a lot

132
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:46,560
of this for centuries and we're just

133
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,680
trying to put it together in an easier

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,560
way to explain it and when we start

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,860
talking about silicon in the terms of

136
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,259
nutrients it really takes

137
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,780
um kind of that weird

138
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,699
anomaly that people use to try and

139
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,299
describe what silicon is and puts it

140
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,919
into a much easier understandable

141
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,680
um Realm

142
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,918
of topics

143
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,660
so you mentioned uh silicate is the form

144
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,139
when we have talked about something like

145
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,780
potassium silicate or silicate um

146
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,519
that breaks down to salicylic acid and

147
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,659
then that's what's actually available to

148
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,198
the plant

149
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,620
is that correct correct so yes with the

150
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:35,460
silicates the so it's a cation the

151
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,459
calcium potassium or sodium keep the

152
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,379
silicon and oxygen from interacting with

153
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:43,079
one another because silicon loves to

154
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,819
interact with itself and if they didn't

155
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,519
have these other

156
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,139
elements present then it would form an

157
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,120
amorphous

158
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,160
um almost like a gel and not always a

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,699
gel but an amorphous group of silicone

160
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,819
compounds that the plant can't absorb so

161
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,538
it only absorbs those single units of

162
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:06,960
salicylic acid and so by having

163
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:09,538
uh potassium calcium or sodium in that

164
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:13,079
formulation it helps keep more of them

165
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:16,098
in smaller units that the plant can then

166
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,379
take up just like any of our other

167
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:21,779
nutrients nitrate phosphate they all

168
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,159
have different forms that the plants are

169
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,279
able to absorb through different

170
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,319
mechanisms silicon is very similar and

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,179
we know salicylic acid is that form

172
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,680
that's the one that we're looking for to

173
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,680
be transported by the plants

174
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:40,258
so you mentioned that amorphous forms

175
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,859
are unavailable

176
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,919
um

177
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,538
can can we jump ahead actually here and

178
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,698
I want to come back to the benefits but

179
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:51,360
can we talk about some of these forms so

180
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,560
when I think of potassium silicate uh

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,360
starting there that's probably the most

182
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,800
common I'm familiar with it's you know

183
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,520
in dynago protect uh egg cell 16h

184
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,560
um

185
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,538
can can you talk a little about that and

186
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,660
then maybe we can go to like calcium

187
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:08,339
silicate silica sand diatomaceous earth

188
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,120
you know these these sources that like

189
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:15,418
pop into my head as a grower of silica

190
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,160
yep and so really the word amorphous

191
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,439
versus crystalline

192
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,199
um when silicon's in an amorphous form

193
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,418
it it's going to be more easily broken

194
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,000
down in salicylic acid than a

195
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:30,538
crystalline form so we can think of

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,299
Crystal like um like a diamond is highly

197
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,580
crystallized carbon and you know it's

198
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,098
very strong and so when we think of the

199
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,038
crystallized form of silicon that is

200
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,200
what quartz is in the sand so it's a

201
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,120
very strong crystalline it's going to

202
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,240
take a long time for us to get those

203
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,759
salicic acid units to break apart from

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,860
that structure with the amorphous

205
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,679
structure it's a much more relaxed

206
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,080
structure usually with a larger surface

207
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,079
area so we have more of that silicon

208
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,019
that can come off of salicylic acid

209
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,839
so but at the same time not all

210
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,839
amorphous forms of silicon have the same

211
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,240
release rate so it gets a little bit

212
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,700
tricky there when we think of

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,399
crystalline versus amorphous

214
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,519
now when we get to the potassium

215
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,820
silicates even though

216
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,000
um when I think of amorphous silicon I

217
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,879
think of a group like what's present in

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,299
the grasses or the phytolus or the Opals

219
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,899
or the biogenic silicon that's deposited

220
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:38,039
within a plant where it's a larger

221
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:41,339
amount of

222
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,399
silicone deposited and that is not what

223
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,560
is present in these potassium silicates

224
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,360
um whether they're in solution or in a

225
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,018
dry powdered form

226
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,259
with that the Silicon is in much smaller

227
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,899
subunits and a lot of it is

228
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:01,078
kept within that single salicic acid

229
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,299
unit so the release rate from a

230
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:07,679
potassium silicate is going to be a lot

231
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:10,740
higher than say a release rate from Rice

232
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,739
Halls which have a biogenic amorphous

233
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,278
form of the Silicon that's present there

234
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,500
and so we can think of these potassium

235
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,600
and calcium and sodium silicates as

236
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,879
having

237
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,579
a salicic acid fraction which is a

238
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:30,659
certain percent of that and then small

239
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:34,439
amounts are either one or two silicon

240
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:37,379
group together in like a dimer or small

241
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,880
polymers that can be released into that

242
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:44,338
salicylic acid for plant uptake

243
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,078
so I actually stated that incorrectly

244
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,920
the amorphous is the more available form

245
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:52,799
for those listening um and

246
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,939
one thing I was worried about when we

247
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,919
were when I first started using

248
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,519
potassium silicate was

249
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,519
um

250
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,139
I believe the term is silicosis

251
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,019
um how dangerous

252
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,039
is it to breathe

253
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,659
these sorts of things as you're

254
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,819
utilizing them from a grower perspective

255
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,539
how careful do we need to be with PPE

256
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,540
and things like that

257
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:19,260
so with silicosis that usually is due to

258
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,659
the particle size the particle size is

259
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,720
the biggest thing that you need to look

260
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,799
into with that for the most part for

261
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,200
something

262
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,240
to be small enough to be inhaled deep

263
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,160
enough into our lungs we're looking at a

264
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,980
particle size less than five

265
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:40,259
uh I think it's five

266
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,300
yeah I want to say nanometers or microns

267
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,299
it might be five microns

268
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,179
um but it and it is is so when you have

269
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,799
a very very small particle size

270
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,439
um and the other thing is it's

271
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,759
crystalline silica that does this and

272
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,040
it's because

273
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,539
um within the lungs the macrophages try

274
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,699
to engulf it

275
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:02,159
um and get rid of it and it's not able

276
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,879
to and then it causes

277
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,879
um

278
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,439
scarring and release of hydrogen and

279
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,019
there's a whole disease process that's

280
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,839
associated with it however when we look

281
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,240
at the Silicon materials that are on the

282
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,060
market as a fertilizer and specifically

283
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,399
looking at the dry material that have a

284
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:23,219
higher incidence of dust and inhalation

285
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,000
these particle sizes are much much

286
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:32,000
higher than the crystalline size that is

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,139
associated with asbestos and other small

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,360
silicone compounds that would cause

289
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,539
silicosis

290
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,039
um or mesothelioma so a lot of the

291
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,078
products that are out there as a

292
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,778
fertilizer they pass

293
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,819
safety tests because they are a larger

294
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,860
particle size and they won't be inhaled

295
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,440
deep into the lung to cause that type of

296
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,899
reaction

297
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,700
that's good to know that makes me feel a

298
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,659
little bit better I still want to be

299
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,339
careful when mixing these yes well and

300
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,620
that's with anything that's going to

301
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,680
form a dust it and it doesn't matter

302
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,778
whether it's Clay whether you know all

303
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:14,578
products that form a dusk a dust they do

304
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:15,740
suggest wearing a mask and reducing that

305
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:19,439
inhalation

306
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,000
but in the form of the scoliosis it's

307
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,980
really dependent on the particle size

308
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,839
and the crystalline form of the Silicon

309
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,320
that's in there

310
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,120
now in terms of the the silicates is one

311
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,180
better than the other if we're comparing

312
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,778
potassium calcium or sodium

313
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:39,179
in terms of uh honestly salicylic acid

314
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:41,578
salicylic acid

315
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,919
so in terms of

316
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,958
um a silicone fertilizer if you apply

317
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,479
any of those at the same salicylic acid

318
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,018
concentration you're going to get the

319
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,500
same silicon response I have not seen

320
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:59,220
any tests yet that would

321
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,519
so that one formulation is going to

322
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,759
outperform another based on whether it's

323
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,339
a calcium sodium or potassium

324
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,919
what you need to think about though is

325
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,680
for instance with the calcium silicates

326
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,719
they can release calcium oxide and it

327
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,958
might have an effect on ph which you

328
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,480
might need or you might not want

329
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,039
with the Sodium silicates every if

330
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,039
you're worried about

331
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,799
raising sodium levels that's always a

332
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,419
concern but with the concentration of

333
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,120
the salicylic acid that we're putting

334
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,338
into these systems the amount of sodium

335
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,100
that's coming along with it is very very

336
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:41,399
small and so even though there's that

337
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,100
potential there you can kind of you need

338
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,778
to be aware at what concentration the

339
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,699
sodium is really going in so you're not

340
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:49,500
really adding that sodium stress that

341
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:50,939
some people shy away from the sodium

342
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,120
silicates from

343
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,800
that makes sense yeah that reminds me of

344
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,100
the idea of with

345
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,958
table salt versus uh Himalayan salt the

346
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,879
amount of trace minerals in there is so

347
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,778
minimal that we really probably aren't

348
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,179
getting

349
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,259
uh as much of a health benefit as people

350
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,819
claim

351
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,939
um versus using you know straight

352
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,980
calcium chloride so it's all about right

353
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,300
concentrations I guess is the point

354
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,320
correct um

355
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:21,719
yeah so moving on uh you know I went to

356
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,180
a trade show quite a few years ago and

357
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,300
there was a company selling uh silica

358
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:29,819
sand and they claimed this was a great

359
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:31,799
source of uh silica for your plant and

360
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,100
and my first question to them and I'm

361
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,539
fairly ignorant on on Silicon was

362
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,040
um you know when does this become

363
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,899
available to my plant and they didn't

364
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,778
really have an answer they said there's

365
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,379
a lot of variables associated with that

366
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:45,659
um

367
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,019
what would what would you think about a

368
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,698
product like that in uh cultivation

369
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:54,839
scenario when we would want

370
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:57,120
the you know the salicylic acid Within

371
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,660
you know period of a cultivation period

372
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,698
of let's say weeks to months

373
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:06,600
right so and that's that's really what

374
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:09,179
it comes down to is is it a soil

375
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,720
additive or soil amendment or is it a

376
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:14,338
silicon fertilizer so when we think of a

377
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
silicone fertilizer that means it's

378
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,560
going to release enough salicylic acid

379
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,500
through that single growing season

380
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,539
um and you know if it provides more the

381
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,879
next or the third growing season awesome

382
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:28,439
you have an added benefit versus the

383
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,500
soil amendment which is something that

384
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,959
you're putting in to help rebuild the

385
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,059
Silicon pools within the soil which

386
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,819
really is not something that you would

387
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,979
do if you're in the soilless media or

388
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,959
more of a Horticulture floor culture

389
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,039
type of production system

390
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,778
so when we look at things like these

391
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,659
sand additives

392
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:54,240
the test that I've run on the products

393
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:56,759
that we have that are more of the

394
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,220
crystalline sand have not shown any

395
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,139
release rate of salicylic acid that

396
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,480
would provide enough silicon for any of

397
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,798
the plants that we use during a growing

398
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,099
season

399
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,740
however if we were to work that into say

400
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:13,798
a soil system where you have microbes

401
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,318
that can actually weather crystalline

402
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,599
forms of silica that would be present in

403
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,740
sand material or more

404
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,779
um highly structured amorphous material

405
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:28,400
that may work as an additive and you

406
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:32,579
might see benefits from that over years

407
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,759
but from what I've done we haven't

408
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:38,159
really seen much of a benefit using

409
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,419
those types of products so one thing I

410
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,980
would ask those companies is to show

411
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:46,380
information where they grew plants with

412
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,440
and without and they saw an increase in

413
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,100
foliar silicon with that treatment that

414
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,360
would be an indication that the material

415
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:59,038
would provide silicon to the plants

416
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,619
I mean that seems like a reasonable

417
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,058
standard for for a company

418
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,918
um you know a lot of times you'll just

419
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:06,720
see side-by-side photos but there can be

420
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,720
so many other variables associated with

421
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,819
that so correct yep and that's the thing

422
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,279
it could improve water drainage it could

423
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,798
improve so many other physical barriers

424
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:19,200
that the response they're showing you in

425
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,298
those photos is not a silicon response

426
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,120
but showing that they see a difference

427
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:27,240
in Silicon concentration in the foliar

428
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,939
tissue that suggests that it does

429
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,279
release silicon and you may have some of

430
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,779
the benefits that are mentioned in the

431
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:37,319
literature

432
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:40,079
wonderful well in a kind of a similar

433
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:42,599
product would be diatomaceous earth can

434
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,980
you talk a little bit about uh that as

435
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,019
well

436
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,298
yes so

437
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,400
um I haven't again I've just done

438
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:54,179
extraction studies with diatomaceous

439
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,340
earth it does come in lower

440
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:59,880
um so when I say extraction studies

441
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:03,899
similar to how they determine what uh

442
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,660
the water soluble nutrients are we have

443
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,220
right now A extraction that we use to

444
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,460
determine if there's plant available

445
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,140
silicon in that and so we call it just

446
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,660
shorthand of the five-day method so

447
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,340
that's what I'll be referring to as so

448
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,919
with this five-day method in the

449
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:21,178
diatomaceous earth we do see that it

450
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,660
provides

451
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:27,600
um at least 0.2 percent silicon which is

452
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,480
2 000 parts per million

453
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:34,379
um and what our application that we

454
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:38,058
suggest is anywhere from 60 uh 30 to 60

455
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:42,299
parts per million in a soilless system

456
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:46,918
and so with it coming in at 2000 it does

457
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:51,000
have a potential to be a silicon source

458
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:54,900
for uh both the Horticulture and

459
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,660
soilless type Medias or for soil as a

460
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,940
soil amendment however it probably has a

461
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,120
better advantage or if you have the

462
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,279
crust microbes in your soilless mix that

463
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,319
could help release even more of the

464
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,819
Silicon that's present so not all the

465
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,038
Silicon that's present within the

466
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:14,158
diatomaceous earth is going to be

467
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,019
released in some situations but you

468
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,720
could encourage that release depending

469
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,119
on what's present within your growing

470
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,480
environment

471
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,759
so d e does have some potential then you

472
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,380
think in in soilless media

473
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,379
um

474
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,780
what I do think it does it warrants it

475
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,000
definitely warrants more studies

476
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,019
wonderful I mean it's a very affordable

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,480
Source

478
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,119
um what so do you know what percentage

479
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,798
of salicylic acid

480
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,079
um we we could expect or how would it

481
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,079
compare to like a silicate application

482
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,100
um so it's going to be much lower

483
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:59,220
um with some of the calcium silicate

484
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,558
products that we use it releases about a

485
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,839
one percent silicon when you get into

486
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,639
things like will last the night that's

487
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,740
up to

488
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,679
with the five day extraction anywhere

489
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,140
from four to six percent silicon so it's

490
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,080
at a much lower range and you would have

491
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,960
to add more of the product into the mix

492
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:22,019
to get to those silicon levels

493
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,880
um but then again depending on what it

494
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,980
is you're growing that's going to

495
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,299
dictate how much silicon you actually

496
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,919
need additionally in that growing media

497
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:34,679
so for some

498
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,580
um fruits or vegetables the diatomaceous

499
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,400
earth might be great whereas for your

500
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:43,319
plants that accumulate silicon to the

501
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,900
levels of calcium potassium or nitrogen

502
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:49,379
you might need to bump it up with other

503
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,700
sources or use a combination of sources

504
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,419
for those

505
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,779
higher feeders

506
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,780
now in this case the podcast is focused

507
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:02,519
more for cannabis or hemp production How

508
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,558
would

509
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,658
I mean I know cannabis hyper accumulates

510
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,298
it seems like everything

511
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,620
um how have you seen any research in

512
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:12,619
relation to silica

513
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,720
um there have been some and this

514
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,798
actually came out I did get some

515
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,019
information from uh Dave who's part of

516
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,658
the dynago group and they did tissue

517
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,960
analysis for cannabis and so it comes in

518
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:33,140
about two percent SI so it's up there

519
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,179
above the calcium

520
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,000
at potassium and nitrogen that's how

521
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,280
much silicon those plants need and so

522
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,440
when we get into stuff like cannabis but

523
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,599
then even there's floor culture plants

524
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,659
verbena which takes up two percent in

525
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,879
Lantana these plants take up such a high

526
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:55,020
amount that you need to make sure it's

527
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,539
present within the media at a high

528
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,900
release rate because they continually

529
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:02,640
take it up well while they're growing

530
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,620
and while they're maturing so unlike

531
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,080
other plants that take up certain

532
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,599
amounts only during certain times of

533
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,639
their maturation these plants that hyper

534
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,038
accumulate silicon tend to take it up

535
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,259
continuously throughout their life cycle

536
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:19,500
and so they need a continuous supply of

537
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:23,400
it in order for them

538
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:26,579
to benefit and have the best health and

539
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,798
the best production that's available

540
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:31,259
yeah I realize we haven't talked about

541
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,819
the benefits yet I still want to hold on

542
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:35,298
that one because I had a couple more

543
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:39,359
questions now that we dove into this um

544
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:40,019
so in in regards to

545
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,719
um

546
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,220
you mentioned with application rates how

547
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,259
important it is that it's a consistent

548
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,558
application do we need to worry about

549
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,658
toxicities or excesses with silicon in

550
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:54,139
relation to plants if it is a

551
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:58,140
essentially a nutrient

552
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,759
so with it it is a nutrient um and

553
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,340
hopefully we'll get it to that status

554
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,900
here soon in the U.S but all that aside

555
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:09,178
one of the most amazing things about

556
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:13,380
silicon compared to all the other

557
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:15,200
elements is I believe it is one of the

558
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,419
most regulated and the most

559
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,380
well-regulated nutrients that are

560
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,559
present

561
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,120
plants only take up and absorb the

562
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,700
amount of silicon that they can deal

563
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:29,819
with at that time so what that means is

564
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,360
unlike nitrogen and phosphate copper and

565
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:34,558
all of our other nutrients we do not see

566
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,379
phytotoxicity symptoms from over

567
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,859
fertilizing with silicon

568
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,720
um so even if you're growing a plant's a

569
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,599
wide variety of plants some that are

570
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,900
hyper accumulators some that accumulate

571
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:51,000
at the micronutrient level you can apply

572
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,100
the same concentration to all those

573
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,298
plants and you're not going to see

574
00:24:53,099 --> 00:25:00,418
negative effects the only instance in

575
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:01,019
the literature where they do so

576
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,500
um

577
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:06,179
abnormal floral development is when they

578
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,759
were applying a really high

579
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,320
concentration of a liquid silicon is a

580
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,658
drench

581
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,298
um and they what I think was happening

582
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:18,840
is it was tying up low levels of either

583
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:21,599
nick nickel or zinc in the growth media

584
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:25,139
and so they were having a metal induced

585
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:28,319
efficiency but at those levels they are

586
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,538
well above the recommended level of any

587
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,240
fertilizer that's here so as long as

588
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:35,579
you're following the label rights and

589
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,720
um the fertilizer recommendations that

590
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:40,579
are on the packages that type of

591
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,819
um

592
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:47,339
a metal deficiency should not occur with

593
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:50,278
application

594
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:53,579
wonderful well finishing up

595
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,859
um these the sources conversation we you

596
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:58,859
mentioned biogenic sources one of those

597
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:00,599
being uh rice holes I know you've you've

598
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:04,319
mentioned off air to me that there are

599
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:06,778
other potential sources uh that are that

600
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,399
you can derive silicon from can you talk

601
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:11,579
a little bit about these as a category

602
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,778
and then more specifically rifles

603
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,599
yeah

604
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:17,579
um sir so obvious there are lots of

605
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,619
plants um especially within the grass

606
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:21,899
and Grains that take up high amounts of

607
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:25,619
silicon and they do so because they're

608
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:29,220
actually depositing it into uh epidermal

609
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:33,178
cells or cells that are on the outside

610
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:36,298
of the leaf tissue and so with these

611
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:39,000
deposits as the leaves go back into the

612
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:41,519
soil this helps regenerate that silicon

613
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,700
cycle and helps break down and provide

614
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,278
silicon and so a lot of different plants

615
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,460
have different mechanisms to get silicon

616
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:53,400
up into foliar tissue whether it's the

617
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,319
epidermal cells trichomes

618
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,298
um and then as those fall back down to

619
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,819
the ground it can be released so we can

620
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:02,099
take advantage of the plants that take

621
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,259
high concentrations of that like rice so

622
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:05,939
when it goes into the rice halls and I

623
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:09,179
sorry I don't have the number in front

624
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:12,298
of me but it's a I think between 40 and

625
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:15,179
50 percent of the nutrients that are

626
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:18,480
present is silicon and so it's a great

627
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:21,840
source but only if those rice plants are

628
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,179
grown and fertilized with silicon and so

629
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,879
when we think of other things

630
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:28,919
um wheat straw another great source but

631
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,039
the problem with wheat is you can also

632
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,759
get some pathogen carryover

633
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:37,259
um miscanthus has been tested bamboo

634
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,440
um

635
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,898
I'm kind of uh people are looking into

636
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,519
horsetail

637
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:47,219
and some other of these really high

638
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,460
accumulating species to see how they can

639
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,659
incorporate either that vegetation as a

640
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,298
compost

641
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:56,460
um with the rice halls I know we were

642
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,259
doing some work with the USDA where we

643
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,659
were making the rice Halls into a

644
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,398
biochar and seen really get great

645
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,340
responses

646
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:07,798
um and using it that way and with the

647
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:10,500
rice Halls too they are starting to look

648
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:14,879
at extracting the silicon and making

649
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:17,819
almost a nano silicon material from the

650
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,440
rice halls and so getting rid of

651
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:21,720
everything else and strictly using it

652
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,000
for a silicon source

653
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,860
there are other

654
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,839
um

655
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:29,699
biogenic forms though such as in pine

656
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,259
needles surprisingly enough Piney

657
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,440
needles have a really really high

658
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:36,658
concentration of silicon but due to the

659
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,880
chemical composition it doesn't break

660
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:41,159
down and release over time so even

661
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,500
though there's a lot there the phenolics

662
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,860
and everything do not make it a viable

663
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,659
source to incorporate or get any of the

664
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,139
Silicon benefits out of those pine

665
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,140
needles

666
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,100
um so there are options out there that

667
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,918
can help

668
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:01,619
as a more natural source but the main

669
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,799
thing to be aware of is how was that

670
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,898
Source material grown with silicon used

671
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,639
in the production because if it wasn't

672
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:11,278
and it's on land that had been

673
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,460
cultivated for a long time the Silicon

674
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:18,179
values are not going to be as high as

675
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,880
they should be from the trials that were

676
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,798
published in the literature

677
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,140
so you're actually seeing pretty big

678
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,359
variants there so we can't just assume

679
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,500
that because they're rice holes they're

680
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,079
going to be

681
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:35,038
high in Silicon for example

682
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:39,058
correct correct and as with rice holes

683
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,480
being a waste or a byproduct well a

684
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:45,658
byproduct waste in essence

685
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,579
they are not currently to my knowledge I

686
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,740
don't think anyone goes through and

687
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,319
there's no guaranteed analysis on what

688
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:56,519
the Silicon composition are of the rice

689
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:58,918
Falls and so it's really

690
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:01,619
um unless you're there you're doing that

691
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,840
on your own to ensure that you are

692
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:06,178
getting that silicon out of the rice

693
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,278
Halls it's it's kind of one of those

694
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,380
things that it could be hit or miss and

695
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,298
that could be why some people who have

696
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,940
tried using rice Halls to incorporate

697
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:16,740
and have not been seen the responses

698
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,919
are not seeing the responses because

699
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,079
that silicon isn't there like it is

700
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,440
um in some of the earlier trials where

701
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:29,398
we were making sure that the starting

702
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,840
material were fed silicon

703
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,898
I think that's a really important point

704
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,178
because I see these charts uh floating

705
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,619
around the internet of a variety of

706
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,798
different um

707
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:46,079
nutrient values for everything from

708
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:48,379
you know various manures fish uh fish

709
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,418
meal Alfalfa whatever

710
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,580
but people don't take into account like

711
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:56,399
what that animal ate

712
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,740
um you know what what it actually

713
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,898
accumulated and so it's important I

714
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,278
think for folks to consider testing

715
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:05,099
their sources or this is where

716
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:08,339
guaranteed analysis uh comes into play

717
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:10,259
and labeling um which we will talk about

718
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,759
as well

719
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,298
um wonderful now

720
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,980
the I think we should probably get into

721
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:18,898
why the heck people would want to use

722
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,058
Silica in their Garden

723
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:22,739
um in the first place I I kind of jumped

724
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:26,178
ahead of you there

725
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,179
um let's talk about all the benefits

726
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,979
okay well there there are quite a few

727
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,720
benefits especially if you are growing

728
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:39,659
under silicon deficient type situations

729
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,960
so really what silicon is best known for

730
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:46,200
is to mitigate stress or to reduce

731
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,399
stress in a plant's life and plants are

732
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,240
constantly

733
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:54,538
under changing environmental condition

734
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,240
um microbial attack test attack insect

735
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:59,179
herbivore lots of things are going on

736
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,880
that they're trying to compensate with

737
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:05,038
changes in water from you know over

738
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,260
watering to underwatering

739
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,440
so with all of this when we start

740
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:14,398
putting silicon back into the system

741
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:17,220
what happens is the plant is now able to

742
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:19,859
better manage the stress it has a more

743
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,019
balanced environment and it's doing this

744
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:24,778
number one what we're starting to see is

745
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:27,058
when we start feeding silicon it can set

746
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:28,980
up the barriers that are present within

747
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:31,558
the roots that can help hold the water

748
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,899
in and it can help reduce the

749
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,579
transpiration or the water loss through

750
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:38,538
the leaves

751
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:41,699
and so by maintaining that water

752
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:43,919
constantly within the plant what that

753
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,019
does is it helps maintain a more

754
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,019
balanced concentration of all the other

755
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:51,659
nutrients that are there it helps dilute

756
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:54,778
out waste products so it's just having

757
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,419
that water response helps the plants

758
00:32:54,778 --> 00:33:00,179
just better deal with everything this

759
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,640
also helps them cool faster less

760
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:05,820
susceptibility

761
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:09,120
to heat stress less susceptibility to

762
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:12,538
Drought stress but then on top of that

763
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,479
we also know that silicon is involved in

764
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:19,859
a lot of the enzymatic reactions so when

765
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:23,460
we get a pathogen attack or a heavy

766
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:26,819
metal toxicity silicon can help offset

767
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,778
what's going on within the cell and help

768
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:33,058
the immune system respond more rapidly

769
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:37,099
when it comes to say a pathogen disease

770
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:40,859
or it can also not just help with

771
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:43,379
reducing the enzymatic stress from

772
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:45,240
having too many or heavy metals in there

773
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,340
it can also keep the metals from

774
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,960
actually making it into the cytoplasm

775
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:51,480
where it's having its effect

776
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,759
so I apologize I got a little bit deep

777
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,899
there but really the responses of

778
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,778
silicon

779
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:59,579
is the plants can deal with changes to

780
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:02,240
the environment so whether it's hot or

781
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:06,599
cold wet or dry

782
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,838
too much salt too much sun it can also

783
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,338
help when we have

784
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,199
toxicities which you might not see too

785
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:14,639
much in your garden but you know if

786
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,279
you're using some of the copper

787
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,338
pesticides you might see responses it

788
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,019
can help mitigate against that

789
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:24,838
the main thing that a lot of people see

790
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:27,780
though is disease reduction especially

791
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:31,078
when we talk about our mildews or our

792
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,060
bacterial diseases and that is the one

793
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,560
coolest thing that you can see that we

794
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,898
don't talk a lot about when we talk

795
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,358
about fertilizers because then they want

796
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:41,219
to label silicon as a pesticide but it's

797
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,219
not it's a nutrient because it's not

798
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:47,219
acting directly on the pathogen but it's

799
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:50,279
reducing that

800
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:53,699
um infection process and so if you're

801
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,660
dealing with a lot of mildews or

802
00:34:53,699 --> 00:35:00,598
bacteria botrytis root rot silicon can

803
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:03,000
help the plant have a better response a

804
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,859
better immune system and so those are

805
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,019
where you're going to see more of a

806
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:09,019
visual response when it comes to Silicon

807
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:15,619
so essentially you're saying there's

808
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:20,098
research related to fungal pathogens

809
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:26,039
bacterial as well as insects

810
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:28,800
yes yep and viruses so every so and

811
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:31,019
that's you know people think that it's

812
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,880
too good to be true

813
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,759
um one thing I really want to point out

814
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,579
silicon is involved in all of these but

815
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,839
all of these responses are not directly

816
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:45,420
due to Silicon it's due to how silicon

817
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:47,578
is bringing the internal

818
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,400
um environment within the plant into a

819
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,019
balance and so it's allowing the

820
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,820
genetics that are already there to

821
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:57,719
perform to the best ability that they

822
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,640
can and so that's where silicon looks

823
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,559
like it's affecting all of these but

824
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:04,259
really what silicon is doing is it's

825
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:08,338
balancing the plant out so the plants

826
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,260
own responses can perform to the best

827
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:13,440
potential that's there

828
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,960
so using silicon your garden doesn't

829
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,358
necessarily mean you're not going to see

830
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,760
botrytus and

831
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,880
spider mites and a variety of other

832
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,500
issues but you may see less pronounced

833
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,940
damage or

834
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:32,940
it it greatly reduces these responses

835
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,960
and so that's where we we start talking

836
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,019
about

837
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,659
um you can if you go in and you're using

838
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:42,000
any type of

839
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:45,539
um if you're using a pesticide or a

840
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,579
chemical to help control what we see is

841
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,858
you can use less of that chemical you

842
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,900
can use less of these synthetic

843
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:53,119
responses because now you have a more

844
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,099
robust

845
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,380
biological response by the plant the

846
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,200
same um like if you're using beneficial

847
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,920
insects or another means to deal with

848
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:08,039
this if you don't have silicon you're

849
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,980
you're missing out on a huge part of

850
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:13,019
disease resistance or health for those

851
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:16,980
plants and so by bringing silicon in

852
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:19,739
it's going to help your itm strategies

853
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,440
um be a lot stronger and you can start

854
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:24,838
reducing costs on some of those

855
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,740
components depending on what it is that

856
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:30,719
you're

857
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:32,219
using to combat some of these issues

858
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,959
so

859
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:36,899
kind of

860
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,400
you know going off of that how do we

861
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,579
best apply

862
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,920
these silicon products

863
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:47,220
you know some are going to be applied

864
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,680
directly to our soil some are used as a

865
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:50,519
foliar application

866
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,460
um

867
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:55,320
does it make a difference in terms of

868
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,760
how we apply it like let's say I know

869
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,519
I'm starting to see but try this should

870
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,000
I be doing foliar applications of a

871
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:05,338
silicate product versus

872
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
counting on there being sufficiency in

873
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:08,000
my soil mix

874
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:15,000
so the great thing is um what I tell

875
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,760
Growers and Farmers apply it the best

876
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,599
way that you can work it into your

877
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,000
system

878
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,280
whether you're applying it so obviously

879
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,320
if you have a solid product you're going

880
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,599
to want to incorporate into the media or

881
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,519
the soil with the liquid products you

882
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,320
can apply either as a drench or foliar

883
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,719
application

884
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,720
and we're still seeing benefits from

885
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,279
both how the mechanisms are likely going

886
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,219
to be different between a foliar

887
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,560
application and a root application but

888
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:46,618
however you can get that silicon into

889
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,199
your system is going to help the plants

890
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,960
respond to that what's nice about

891
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,838
applying it as a drench when we're

892
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,400
talking about liquids is it can be taken

893
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,799
up through the root system and

894
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,858
transported all throughout the plant so

895
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,420
we know with silicon similar to calcium

896
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:05,940
and copper and some of our other

897
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,400
nutrients it doesn't load into the

898
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,320
phloem so it moves through the xylem

899
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,720
tissue which means once you apply it to

900
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,420
a leaf it's not going to move out of

901
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,819
that leaf into other areas of the plant

902
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,559
and so that's why with the foliar

903
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,019
applications you have to do a continual

904
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,338
foliar application so that the new

905
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:28,619
growing

906
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:31,259
um tissue has a silicon present for its

907
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,940
Developmental and um

908
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,859
Health needs

909
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,380
and so

910
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:39,239
even with that though we do there are

911
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,358
benefits that are shown in the

912
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:44,699
literature with foliar application and

913
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:46,858
definitely with using these materials as

914
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:49,858
a drench so

915
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:52,578
depending on the product itself they may

916
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:55,858
suggest one application versus the other

917
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:58,740
but it really comes down to what's going

918
00:39:55,858 --> 00:40:00,598
to be best to get it into your system

919
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:03,179
um to help combat that so even if it is

920
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,640
a foliar pathogen moving up through the

921
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:07,379
root system it's going to get into the

922
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,420
internal portion of the leaf and help

923
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,420
have that response because it's coming

924
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,358
from an internal response it's not

925
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,639
coming from a physical barrier that's

926
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:22,019
just being formed on that leaf surface

927
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:23,659
it's happening inside that leaf

928
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:26,039
foreign

929
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:28,799
that was exactly what I wanted to hear

930
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,960
thank you so much for sharing that

931
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,119
um so we can do soil drenches

932
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,480
essentially and still effectively treat

933
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,119
disease in a reasonable time frame

934
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,940
um for plant response

935
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,858
all of my studies that I have done as a

936
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,858
graduate student and with USDA we're

937
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:50,578
using silicon as it drives I'm just now

938
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:53,578
this year starting to get into looking

939
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:58,220
at what effects full your application

940
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:58,220
has on some of these responses

941
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,760
well that that leads me to a conundrum

942
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,598
here I want to talk about

943
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,220
um

944
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,200
you know you mentioned foliar versus

945
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:09,719
soil drench and that makes me think of

946
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,460
potassium silicate and the labeling laws

947
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,259
around it

948
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,599
um but then I also want to talk about

949
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,680
heavy metals which would you like to

950
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,160
cover

951
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:19,159
first

952
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,659
um let's talk about heavy metals and

953
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,838
then we'll get into the legalities of

954
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:31,139
everything okay perfect all right well

955
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,818
yeah talk to me about heavy metals and

956
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:35,338
um you know some of these sources

957
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:38,039
I and and how that might be uh something

958
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:40,019
that Growers should be thinking about

959
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:42,539
yep so

960
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:44,818
um going back to the Rice hall

961
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:48,300
um talk and how we want to make sure

962
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:51,358
that these materials silicons present in

963
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,579
that the same with our plants if we have

964
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,679
these hyper accumulators and we aren't

965
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,960
providing silicon

966
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,940
they're craving the silicon and it's

967
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,980
kind of like you going into your kitchen

968
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,420
late at night craving chocolate and

969
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,980
there's no chocolate in the house so

970
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,260
what happened well and I shouldn't say

971
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,780
you I'm gonna it's me it's really me

972
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,400
that does this I.E everything that's

973
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,680
present whether it's sweet whether it's

974
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,900
salty trying to get that chocolate fix

975
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,719
so when we think about plants that are

976
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,880
hyper accumulators they are trying to

977
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,858
get that silicon so they're turning on

978
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,500
different transport mechanisms trying to

979
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:28,259
scavenge any part of silicon out of that

980
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,119
system and with that what we do is we

981
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,359
get an imbalance of nutrients in the

982
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:36,358
plants phosphate's one of them but the

983
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,219
sad part about it is arsenic cadmium

984
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:40,019
some of these other heavy metals can

985
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:42,899
also be taken up

986
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:45,179
and with arsenic Arsenic and silicon

987
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,780
have very similar

988
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:48,719
um

989
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:50,280
chemical features they're very close on

990
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,739
they're right next door to each other on

991
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,019
the periodic table and so one of the

992
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:57,358
downsides that we know with rice is

993
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:59,579
silicon's not present it will pull

994
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,098
arsenic out of the soil profile and

995
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,780
people might not be aware of it but we

996
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:05,940
have quite a bit of there's arsenic

997
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:09,119
there's heavy metals there's all sorts

998
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:11,579
sorts of what we call contaminants that

999
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,079
are naturally occurring in the soil and

1000
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,940
for the most part the plants don't take

1001
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,400
them up because they have plenty of the

1002
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,619
nutrients that they need but when we get

1003
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,480
into these hyper accumulators the

1004
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:23,880
Arsenic will move up to where the

1005
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,559
silicon's opposed to so when we have

1006
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,838
something like rice halls and we're

1007
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,239
starting to use that as our silicon

1008
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:34,199
fertilizer we can start in

1009
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:37,639
unintentionally be putting arsenic again

1010
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:40,980
likely at low levels into our profile

1011
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:43,139
but if we're growing plants in a silicon

1012
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,719
limited environment they are going to

1013
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:47,699
pull that arsenic out and bioaccumulate

1014
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,459
and specifically for the Cannabis

1015
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:52,500
industry this is a big concern because

1016
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,260
of the high amount of silicon that they

1017
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,179
take up they are desperately trying to

1018
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,339
get that silicon in any way that they

1019
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:02,460
can and I think this is where a lot of

1020
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:06,358
the issues with the higher arsenic

1021
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,980
levels that were seen or the higher

1022
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:10,139
um heavy metals that are being taken up

1023
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,358
into the plant because they don't have

1024
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:16,799
those mechanisms in place that the

1025
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:20,880
Silicon would have used to reduce the

1026
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,060
movement of those Metals into uh the

1027
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,280
cell and into other parts of the plant

1028
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:29,338
and that's the same that we see not just

1029
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,900
for cannabis but for a lot of the other

1030
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:33,838
plants as well

1031
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:37,920
is as soon as we start putting silicon

1032
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:41,460
into the system we see a reduction in

1033
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:45,119
um the phytotoxicity of these Metals if

1034
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:48,000
we are on a contaminated soil and so

1035
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,500
they can kind of outgrow those negative

1036
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,318
responses and still provide a quality

1037
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,358
plant or a quality fruit

1038
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:00,719
well that's a real Gem of information

1039
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,420
that we may be able to increase silicon

1040
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:06,118
in our plant tissue as a way of reducing

1041
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,780
heavy metal uptake

1042
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,180
um

1043
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,040
right that's fascinating it's something

1044
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:13,379
that I'm going to have to do some more

1045
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,059
testing and research on myself because

1046
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,740
it's it's a real challenge in cannabis

1047
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:19,980
like you mentioned um

1048
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:23,039
and you know I do see a lot of Growers

1049
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:25,139
and soil suppliers using rifles in their

1050
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,400
mix and

1051
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,739
um you know many of them are testing

1052
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,280
their soil mixes which is great I mean

1053
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:34,379
if you use I assume if you use like a

1054
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,599
acid extraction for heavy metals you

1055
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,940
would be able to a strong acid you'd be

1056
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:42,960
able to see what is potentially in there

1057
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,700
but um one thing I want to go back to is

1058
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,079
you mentioned that because rice holes

1059
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,699
are a waste product there's no

1060
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,380
guaranteed analysis so we could get

1061
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:52,379
quite a bit of variability batch to

1062
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,780
batch so unless you're testing every

1063
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,720
every batch I don't see how you could

1064
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,980
really determine your levels of arsenic

1065
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:01,259
that you're bringing in every time you

1066
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,539
mix it into your soil

1067
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,460
well and the other thing so I don't want

1068
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:08,639
to scare people away from Rice Halls

1069
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:11,639
saying that it has arsenic I'm but the

1070
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,739
potential is there and even what you

1071
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:16,318
have to it could even be a trace level

1072
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:18,439
that's not even detectable

1073
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:22,019
but when you have a hyper accumulator

1074
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,318
it's going to bioaccumulate very very

1075
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:29,759
small amounts that might be there just

1076
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:31,679
as a very you know background no

1077
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,560
chemical is a hundred percent so even if

1078
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,379
it's at that point zero zero one percent

1079
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:40,500
it's going to be able to find it and

1080
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,960
Pull It in trying to

1081
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,679
satisfy that silicon need within the

1082
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,199
plant

1083
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,000
and so that's that's where the issue

1084
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,699
comes from it's not that there's High

1085
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,800
contamination of arsenic coming in it's

1086
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:54,838
that that background amount that's there

1087
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,000
that's no different than what's out in

1088
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,759
our natural soil system that we

1089
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,358
naturally have you know around us every

1090
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,640
single day it just gets accumulated in

1091
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,679
these species because it's trying to

1092
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,379
find the Silicon

1093
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:12,719
and that's where why it's you know we

1094
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,720
consider these hyper accumulators

1095
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,279
um that can be used for bioremediation

1096
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:19,199
silicon is one of those elements that

1097
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,519
it's going to hyper accumulate but if

1098
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,919
that's not there it's going to find

1099
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:24,838
something else to take its place

1100
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,480
yeah I think it's more we're always just

1101
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:29,699
looking for a potential vectors are

1102
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,699
because I I find water to be one of the

1103
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:35,939
biggest factors soil dust that's kicked

1104
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:36,659
into facilities can oftentimes bring it

1105
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,000
in

1106
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:41,818
um water and contact with Metals

1107
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,280
especially RO water yep we see so so

1108
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:46,079
there's a variety of other things not to

1109
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,839
single out rifles but it is something

1110
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,579
that I think right people should be

1111
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:52,318
thinking about when with all of their

1112
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:54,180
inputs but especially these ones like

1113
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:55,440
you said that could hyper accumulate

1114
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:58,919
right

1115
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,659
yeah and you know that's brings you back

1116
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,099
to the adage that you know as you're

1117
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:04,019
trying to do something that's a more

1118
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,818
natural source you still have to be

1119
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:08,280
careful because natural doesn't always

1120
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:09,420
mean the safest Source or the best

1121
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,059
source

1122
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,280
um and so it's just understanding where

1123
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,780
that natural source is coming from and

1124
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,760
what's present in there and what's

1125
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,319
lacking in there

1126
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,640
yeah now

1127
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:25,139
that made me think of something else

1128
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:27,179
does the pH of your media affect your

1129
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:29,578
silica uptake

1130
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:31,739
like with other nutrients that is

1131
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:34,619
an awesome question

1132
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:36,000
uh I would say that's kind of a loaded

1133
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:40,140
question

1134
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,159
um and in that I main thing I and I

1135
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:43,679
don't know

1136
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:47,338
um I'm not sure of studies that have

1137
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:50,338
looked specifically at pH and uptake

1138
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:52,199
um because and I'm thinking in more of a

1139
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:55,440
soilless media where you don't have that

1140
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:58,318
buffer capacity really within that the

1141
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,679
plant is the major driver of what that

1142
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:04,500
pH of the media is and I know you know

1143
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,919
um and growing systems really work hard

1144
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,679
to maintain it within a certain th range

1145
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,659
um So within those heavily regulated pH

1146
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:15,139
ranges

1147
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:17,759
um you're going to get the same probably

1148
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:20,539
I don't think it'll have as large of an

1149
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,220
effect because the solubility of silicon

1150
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:25,920
between I think it's like four and nine

1151
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:27,779
is going to be the same throughout so

1152
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,519
you're not going to get into a situation

1153
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,559
where it's below four at least in

1154
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:35,519
soilless you know you might in acidic

1155
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:38,180
soils or above nine and So within that

1156
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:41,759
range there's really

1157
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:44,719
very little difference if any in the

1158
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:48,300
availability of maintaining silicon in

1159
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,799
that 60 PPM or 2 millimolar

1160
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,420
concentration

1161
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,920
I mean if you're outside that PH range

1162
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,539
you have other problems at that point

1163
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,639
trying to grow plants right yeah there

1164
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:58,940
yeah you're going to be yeah this really

1165
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:58,940
doesn't

1166
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,480
it really does sound like a miracle uh

1167
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:04,139
element

1168
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,760
um

1169
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,558
in a lot of ways the way you're

1170
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,400
describing it

1171
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,140
um

1172
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:16,440
so I I think this is a good transition

1173
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:18,598
into sort of the labels and products on

1174
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,619
the market because

1175
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,180
um

1176
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:23,160
there's there's challenges around

1177
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:26,879
labeling and I think it's really hard as

1178
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:28,199
a grower to know how to compare uh can

1179
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,818
we start off just talking a little bit

1180
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,460
about potassium silicate because it's

1181
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:35,460
the one I'm most familiar with now it's

1182
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:37,800
approved in organic production uh as

1183
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:43,639
certain applications can you kind of

1184
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:45,480
explain the the regulation around it

1185
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:49,679
sure

1186
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,300
um so all silicon uh products here in

1187
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,039
the U.S including the potassium

1188
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:56,039
silicates

1189
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,300
um are regulated through

1190
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,599
um

1191
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,220
the fertilizer biostimulants soil

1192
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,818
amendments

1193
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:05,098
um

1194
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:07,500
portion of the state regulation so it's

1195
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:09,539
regulated at the state level the

1196
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,780
American Association of plant food

1197
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:14,338
control officials or APCO is the

1198
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,920
governing body that gives

1199
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:19,199
recommendations to the States but then

1200
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,000
it's up to each individual state to

1201
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,039
determine

1202
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,838
um how if they accept those

1203
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,719
recommendations or if they have their

1204
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:30,420
own slight changes to that and so that's

1205
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:34,019
where some of these labels that we see

1206
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:36,420
in some states such as the California

1207
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:37,920
Washington and Oregon might look a

1208
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,619
little different than some of the other

1209
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,380
midwest states

1210
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:45,720
and that can add to some of the

1211
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:49,800
confusion especially when it comes to

1212
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:55,679
Silicon as it has just recently within

1213
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:58,318
the past 15 20 years been a regulated

1214
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:02,219
fertilizer within this group

1215
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:05,159
So currently the avco recommendations

1216
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:07,500
are that when a silicon fertilizer is

1217
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:10,920
labeled it's labeled with the percent

1218
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:13,079
silicon so just percent s i and that's

1219
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,139
based off of that five-day extraction

1220
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:18,420
method I mentioned earlier so what that

1221
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:21,719
tells us is the amount of salicylic acid

1222
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,338
that we can expect to be released from

1223
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:26,159
that material

1224
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:29,880
the problem with this is it was

1225
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:32,460
developed for our solid materials and

1226
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:36,000
not our liquid materials so from a solid

1227
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,858
material basis what we tend to see is

1228
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,358
that the percent silicon that they put

1229
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:43,739
on the label for the solid tends to

1230
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:46,259
overestimate the amount that we see in

1231
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:48,479
plant grow out trials so

1232
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,280
um it tells us there's a higher number

1233
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,760
than what's actually released within

1234
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,319
that growing cycle for grass whereas

1235
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,780
with the liquid products the percent

1236
00:52:55,318 --> 00:53:00,179
that we see is lower than what we

1237
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,760
actually see from the uptake within the

1238
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:06,000
plants so it tends to underestimate

1239
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,119
liquids and overestimate solids can you

1240
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,739
explain what an example of a liquid in a

1241
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,160
solid is

1242
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:17,879
um okay yep in this case so for instance

1243
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,739
the and correct me if I'm wrong here

1244
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,559
um

1245
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:25,558
the is it the egg okay

1246
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,400
is that a solid or a liquid

1247
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:32,339
okay so with the potassium okay the egg

1248
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,099
cell with the solid egg cell sorry yes

1249
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:38,818
okay uh so egg cells of powder that's

1250
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:41,940
yep 100 soluble that

1251
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:45,000
um like for example we mix with water uh

1252
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,559
as a way of okay creating a a liquid

1253
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,780
solution so that's where I was kind of

1254
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,220
confused in terms of how you're defining

1255
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,280
these things

1256
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:55,439
yep so with that since it's applied as a

1257
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,660
liquid that would be it would fall

1258
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,579
likely under the liquid so most of the

1259
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:01,799
potassium silicates we work with are

1260
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:05,099
already in the liquid form that we

1261
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:07,140
purchase from a distributor when we talk

1262
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:09,838
about solids these are things like the

1263
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:12,500
diatomaceous earth will last the night

1264
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,940
um there's ignumberite the sand material

1265
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,858
all of these that are more solid

1266
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,980
components that would be a soil or a

1267
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:22,619
media incorporation are what we refer to

1268
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:25,440
as solid and then we have a number of

1269
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:28,920
different silicon liquid silicon

1270
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,500
products we have potassium silicates we

1271
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,300
have some that we really don't even know

1272
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:36,000
the source of

1273
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,280
um that refer back to the monosulicic

1274
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,599
acid there's calcium silicates that are

1275
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:45,599
in a liquid form and so with that again

1276
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:48,000
all of these are are recommended to

1277
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,838
provide the percent s i

1278
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,119
so that when we go in to purchase we are

1279
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:57,599
looking at how much salicylic acid is

1280
00:54:54,119 --> 00:55:01,680
released the problem is since there

1281
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:04,260
every state has the ability to allow the

1282
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:08,279
labeling there are still products out

1283
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:10,920
there that will give the percent sio2 or

1284
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,700
even the percent salicylicic acid which

1285
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:17,159
is sioh4 and so that what that means is

1286
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:19,379
they can put a higher number in that

1287
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:22,019
percent label

1288
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:25,500
and it it's still the same so if we have

1289
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:28,980
a one percent s i which is a silicon

1290
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,900
they can say that it's two percent sio2

1291
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,059
and as a consumer you're just looking at

1292
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:36,119
one versus two percent

1293
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:38,160
um and then even with the sio4 a one

1294
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:41,280
percent Si would be a three point four

1295
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,838
percent sio H4

1296
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,298
and so

1297
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:47,818
making sure that as we're reading on

1298
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:51,719
these labels and we're understanding

1299
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:53,099
what that percent s i is

1300
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:55,078
um that's where we need to make sure

1301
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:58,500
that we're looking at these accurately

1302
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:01,079
the other thing though a lot all of

1303
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:04,760
these liquid fertilizers

1304
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:08,818
um are usually in concentrations

1305
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:10,619
above at or above three percent s i

1306
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:12,900
which is really kind which is

1307
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:16,500
concentrated compared to what I would

1308
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:20,240
suggest as an application rate of 30 to

1309
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:23,219
60 parts per million which is

1310
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,358
0.003 I might have missed the zero in

1311
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,598
there

1312
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:29,460
um so whether it's one percent or three

1313
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,318
percent s i

1314
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,900
all that means is you're going to either

1315
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:37,139
dilute it out more or less to get that

1316
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:40,019
same response from the Silicon

1317
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:42,719
so if I'm understanding it correctly

1318
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:45,838
you're suggesting that we should convert

1319
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:48,719
all of these products to

1320
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,980
SI percentage just silicon so we can

1321
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,858
compare them

1322
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:55,619
Apples to Apples is that right correct

1323
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:58,798
okay that is correct and that is what

1324
00:56:55,619 --> 00:57:00,720
APCO suggests for their labeling

1325
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,679
recommendations when it comes to Silicon

1326
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:07,199
products so there's no magic bullet

1327
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:08,759
proprietary silicon

1328
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,159
chelated

1329
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,460
I don't even know what other buzzwords

1330
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:16,500
to hit here that justifies a

1331
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,500
significantly higher price point than

1332
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:22,519
really just looking at SI percent

1333
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:26,699
when we talk about these liquid products

1334
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:27,719
so there are some products when we talk

1335
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:29,298
about

1336
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:32,699
um performance

1337
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:34,559
there are some instances where the

1338
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,838
formulation some of the formulations

1339
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,700
allow the products to have a much longer

1340
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:41,880
shelf life

1341
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:44,939
um so some products only state in

1342
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,160
solution for maybe six months to two

1343
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:49,559
years and then form a really thick

1344
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:52,199
silicon gel that isn't going to provide

1345
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:54,720
anything to your plants I have other

1346
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,699
products that I've had for over 15 years

1347
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:00,439
and are still in solution

1348
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:02,598
so there are differences in formulation

1349
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:05,039
that might

1350
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,680
give an advantage of one product over

1351
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,539
another but again those aren't affecting

1352
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:12,118
the Silicon response that you're seeing

1353
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:15,058
if you apply that product at the same

1354
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:16,619
salicylic acid concentration

1355
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:19,200
um the other thing a lot of these

1356
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,900
products are not a stand-alone silicon

1357
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:24,539
product like the potassium silicates and

1358
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,660
so they incorporate other biostimulants

1359
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:29,940
or other nutrients and so it's more of a

1360
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:31,798
blended fertilizer and so you're not

1361
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:34,980
just getting that silicon but you're

1362
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:37,079
getting other nutrients or biostimulants

1363
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:39,780
that are coming along with that silicon

1364
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:42,119
component and so these are the products

1365
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:45,059
that tend to show differences

1366
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,858
in plant size and plant yield because

1367
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:49,079
usually those plant size and plant

1368
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:51,558
yields those are not coming from the

1369
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:55,318
Silicon response unless you're under

1370
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:57,059
extreme stress and so those positive

1371
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:59,900
responses in plant growth are coming

1372
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:04,140
from something else in that formulation

1373
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:07,079
aside from the Silicon component

1374
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:11,519
okay but if I'm just comparing

1375
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:15,240
silica portion of a product because what

1376
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,679
you said makes makes perfect sense for

1377
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:19,139
example I'm looking at a potassium

1378
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:22,500
silicate product right now or a

1379
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:24,358
SI product that contains urea phosphoric

1380
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,539
acid calcium nitrate you know these

1381
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:29,818
other ingredients

1382
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:31,318
along with potassium silicate but if we

1383
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:33,539
want to talk about just the silica

1384
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,159
portion that potassium silicate is going

1385
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:37,199
to be essentially the same potassium

1386
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:39,420
silicate that I'm getting from egg cell

1387
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:41,639
it's it as far as I understand it's all

1388
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:42,960
coming from the PQ Corporation

1389
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:46,019
um

1390
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,699
this idea though that we're getting a

1391
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:52,579
different silica response may or may not

1392
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:56,279
actually be accurate

1393
00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:58,980
the SI is is s i is s-i is s-i I guess

1394
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,619
is what I'm getting at is that you are

1395
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:04,260
100 correct that's safe to say it is

1396
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:07,380
silicone is silicon that is very safe to

1397
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:09,839
say it's salicylic acid is salicylic

1398
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:12,240
acid no matter where it's coming from

1399
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,980
what it's weathered from when it's in

1400
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:16,679
that form that's what's taken up by the

1401
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:19,500
plant and so when you put everything on

1402
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:22,500
that same plane as looking at comparing

1403
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:24,780
salicylic acid to salicylic acid that's

1404
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,699
why that percent s i from the five day

1405
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,280
method even though it's not the best

1406
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:31,798
method that could be out there it's a

1407
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,859
it's an extraction method that at least

1408
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:37,318
gives us a starting point to start

1409
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:40,078
looking at where they fall within that

1410
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:42,179
release rate of the salicylic acid but

1411
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,339
yes you are correct whether it's coming

1412
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,259
from a potassium silicate Source a

1413
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:48,679
calcium silicate Source whether it's at

1414
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:51,180
six percent or three percent

1415
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:53,039
silicon silicon it's going to take up as

1416
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:55,019
much as it wants of the salicylic acid

1417
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,519
and you're going to get similar

1418
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:58,280
responses

1419
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,480
independent of what that starting

1420
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,519
material is

1421
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,318
I I only say this because in the

1422
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:06,659
Cannabis industry we have

1423
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:09,058
so many products and so many companies

1424
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:10,920
promoting products and it's it's very

1425
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:12,180
confusing and there's a lot of marketing

1426
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,318
hype and

1427
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:15,019
you know

1428
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:17,400
some of these products are just

1429
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:19,019
exorbitantly expensive because with

1430
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,119
cannabis you have a crop that's high

1431
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:23,338
value people can spend the money but we

1432
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,260
don't necessarily want or need to so I

1433
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:28,259
just it's good to hear

1434
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:30,359
um that you know maybe we can look for a

1435
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,220
source that's more affordable knowing

1436
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:33,779
that

1437
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:36,480
at least the Silicon that we're getting

1438
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:38,040
is going to be essentially taken up the

1439
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,639
Same by the plant the plant doesn't care

1440
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:45,420
if it had a fancy label or not I guess

1441
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:46,019
correct correct yep wonderful okay

1442
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,659
um

1443
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:49,619
on that topic you brought up

1444
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:53,399
monocylistic I can't even say it

1445
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:56,160
monosilicic acid uh is that a different

1446
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:59,818
form of salicylic acid

1447
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:03,598
um as well no and I apologize nope so no

1448
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:06,599
it's good I I yep nope so orthos

1449
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:11,099
salicylicic acid monosilicic acid and

1450
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:13,160
salicic acid they all refer to the

1451
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:15,059
compound

1452
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:17,480
s-i-oh4 which means there's four

1453
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:20,460
hydroxyl groups surrounding the silicon

1454
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,760
and that is the natural form that is a

1455
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,619
single subunit silicon is never

1456
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,980
um by itself in nature it's always

1457
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:31,980
interacting with the oxygen and so when

1458
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:34,740
we say orthosolic acid that means it

1459
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:37,440
forms and I'm not a chemist so please

1460
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:40,019
don't quote me on all this but it's

1461
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,318
um it's just the form the chemical form

1462
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:46,019
of the formula and how the hydroxyls

1463
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:49,440
come off monosilic acid refers that

1464
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:51,298
there's just one silicon subunit of the

1465
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,700
salicic acid

1466
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:55,679
um and then I just salicylic acid is the

1467
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:59,279
easiest way to say it without adding the

1468
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:01,440
mono or the ortho to try and not scare

1469
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,680
so many people away but it's still kind

1470
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:07,740
of a mouthful you're talking about the

1471
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:10,379
single silicon compound that is absorbed

1472
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:11,699
by plants I personally I'm really glad

1473
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:14,460
you brought it up because I'll have

1474
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:16,679
someone say hey you're you know

1475
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,900
you don't want to use will last night or

1476
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:21,000
calcium silicate because I have a highly

1477
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,579
concentrated monosilicic acid product

1478
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,440
you know and making it sound like it's

1479
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:27,720
something

1480
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:32,039
you know inherently very different so I

1481
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:33,480
I'm glad that you you touched on that uh

1482
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:36,559
did you want to add anything before I

1483
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,559
move on to the last topic

1484
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:43,259
um no no just with that um really it all

1485
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,339
comes down to that percent SI so whether

1486
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:48,059
it's

1487
01:03:44,338 --> 01:03:50,400
on its own as a there are some products

1488
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:52,319
that do have a really high concentration

1489
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,680
of salicylic acid that don't have a

1490
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:57,298
calcium or a potassium or sodium that's

1491
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:00,000
in combination but they have other

1492
01:03:57,298 --> 01:04:02,219
components in that mix that's allowing

1493
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,099
it to stay in that high concentration so

1494
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:06,298
again looking at percent s i that's

1495
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:08,940
where you're going to start putting

1496
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:10,318
everything on an equal playing field and

1497
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,659
that's where that five-day extraction

1498
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,219
comes in it really doesn't care if it's

1499
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:17,639
a straight salicylic acid if it's

1500
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:19,739
combined with calcium potassium or any

1501
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:21,719
of the polymers that are out there it's

1502
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:23,459
strictly looking for how much of that is

1503
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:26,459
going to be in the salicylic acid form

1504
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,679
for the plant uptake

1505
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:31,318
you know there is one thing I forgot to

1506
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:33,659
touch on with you was uh one form of

1507
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:35,880
silicon which is silicon dioxide

1508
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:38,538
and availability can you touch on that

1509
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,539
before we move on

1510
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,260
um so again

1511
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:46,019
that's uh silica

1512
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:49,319
uh the availability is really going to

1513
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:52,259
depend on how it was formed so when

1514
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:54,779
we're talking about uh the silica from a

1515
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,000
volcanic eruption you know in a more of

1516
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:00,119
a glassy type thing it's still amorphous

1517
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
but it doesn't have the same surface

1518
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:05,039
features of a biogenic silica which is

1519
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,838
the opal that we were talking about in

1520
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,760
like the rice halls and the grass grains

1521
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:12,719
so

1522
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,880
um really how that silica was formed is

1523
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:18,000
going to play a role in the release rate

1524
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,740
because there's some recycled glass that

1525
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,960
they heat up really really high and it

1526
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:24,118
becomes really porous and we've found

1527
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:27,358
that even that recycled glass which is a

1528
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:28,920
silica releases a significant amount of

1529
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,838
silicon where we can actually see

1530
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,639
increases in Silicon and plant treatment

1531
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:36,358
when we put a certain amount into the

1532
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:39,118
growing media so it does release

1533
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:41,098
we know it can relieve salicic acid but

1534
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,640
the amount of release is really going to

1535
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:46,440
depend on how it was formed

1536
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,500
and then you're seeing good results you

1537
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:53,460
mentioned uh briefly biochar so if a

1538
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:56,960
high silicon material is pyrolyzed

1539
01:05:53,460 --> 01:06:00,659
you're getting a good silicon product

1540
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:02,639
yes and with that we were comparing we

1541
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:06,000
had rice hauls that we knew were coming

1542
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,739
from a source that had high silicon we

1543
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,679
were using the rice halls and then they

1544
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:14,459
were also paralyzed at the 700 degrees

1545
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:18,078
Celsius in the muscle furnace so the

1546
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:21,240
oxygen was deprived and we were seeing

1547
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:24,359
similar amounts of solicit or silicon

1548
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:28,019
accumulation in a graph study between

1549
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:31,558
those two types of treatments

1550
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:34,318
that's wonderful big fan of biochar in

1551
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:36,900
general so that's so good to hear but

1552
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:39,058
biochar just like everything else you

1553
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:42,180
need to know the source because not all

1554
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:44,460
biochar is going to release

1555
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:47,098
uh or have a high concentration of

1556
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:50,220
silicon it really depends on what the

1557
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:52,079
starting source is yeah I

1558
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:54,899
biochar has a lot of the labeling

1559
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:57,660
challenges and issues yes many other

1560
01:06:54,900 --> 01:07:00,420
things in this industry so

1561
01:06:57,659 --> 01:07:03,179
um okay last question uh thank you so

1562
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:06,960
much for this what are the differences

1563
01:07:03,179 --> 01:07:10,858
across various media sources in regards

1564
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:13,260
to Silicon uptake and plants

1565
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:16,318
is that too big of a question to end the

1566
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:18,420
podcast are you asked like media

1567
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:21,900
components like when we're in like

1568
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:23,760
Hydroponics versus soilless versus uh

1569
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:26,818
actual soil

1570
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:30,119
um okay are there are you seeing it's a

1571
01:07:26,818 --> 01:07:32,219
huge it's a huge question yep so with

1572
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:33,900
soils especially when we're in our

1573
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:36,419
heavier with our clay obviously we're

1574
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,079
going to have a high

1575
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,539
um

1576
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:42,900
a high potential for salicic acid

1577
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:45,839
release when we get into things like our

1578
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:48,180
sandier soils that reduces so but

1579
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:51,058
they're still seeing great responses

1580
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:53,279
when we are fertilizing with silicon

1581
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:56,160
fertilizers on the heavy Clays and on

1582
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,839
the sand so this there's still a lot

1583
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,058
more to the story that we're learning

1584
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:02,639
when we get into these hydroponic

1585
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:04,019
systems though in soilless media we're

1586
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,058
really really lacking that parent

1587
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:09,538
material and minerals that are going to

1588
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:12,059
give us that Baseline amount of silicon

1589
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:14,280
that's needed especially with these

1590
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:18,239
hyper accumulators or macro accumulators

1591
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:21,539
of silicon things like perlite and

1592
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:24,238
vermiculite can add a small amount of

1593
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:27,179
silicon to that and then if we're using

1594
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,079
certain water sources we found well

1595
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:30,239
water

1596
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:32,579
is going to give us a little bit more

1597
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:35,639
boost at least here in Ohio where it's

1598
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:39,000
percolating through clay parent material

1599
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,259
then our surface water is giving us

1600
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,838
um but you're still getting a small

1601
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:43,979
amount if that water is coming

1602
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:46,920
um

1603
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:48,238
from a non-distilled source which I

1604
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,539
don't know many people that use

1605
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:55,198
distilled water or purified water in

1606
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:57,719
those studies but still it it's greatly

1607
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,099
lacking for the responses that we need

1608
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:01,259
and then when you get into these

1609
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:03,179
hydroponic systems

1610
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:05,520
um if you're doing a beta bucket system

1611
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:07,560
with a hundred percent perlite we're

1612
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,299
actually finding that there is quite a

1613
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,600
bit of silicon that's being taken up by

1614
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:14,460
the plants and when we ran analysis of

1615
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,460
the Silicon concentration in the

1616
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,319
reservoir of our perlite buckets they

1617
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,658
were very similar to that that was

1618
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:25,259
present in our two millimolar silicon

1619
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:27,298
treatment so there is a potential that

1620
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:29,640
in those type of systems you might not

1621
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:32,460
to eat need as much of the Silicon

1622
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:35,338
fertilizer as you would in others but

1623
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:38,158
then when we get into nft systems

1624
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:40,859
um your fertilizer source for those

1625
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,658
systems and your water source are going

1626
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:44,520
to dictate how much silicon might be

1627
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:46,679
there as a background but it's still

1628
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,020
likely going to be well below that 60

1629
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:50,940
PPM concentration

1630
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,699
that you would need to add continually

1631
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:58,219
or weekly to that solution to maintain

1632
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:58,219
enough silicon for the plant needs

1633
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:04,919
am I missing any of the media no the

1634
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:06,179
only other thing that you and I had

1635
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,679
talked about

1636
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:09,480
that I thought was sort of

1637
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,880
counter-intuitive for me is I I

1638
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:13,859
mentioned this uh these you know what

1639
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,100
people call living soils these highly

1640
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:18,658
enriched soilless media

1641
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:21,420
um it's what our you know my company

1642
01:10:18,658 --> 01:10:24,539
produces uh for the industry

1643
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:27,600
um we and we had Rock dusts and we have

1644
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:30,539
a compost fraction so there are some you

1645
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,860
know silicon sources in our media

1646
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:34,500
already

1647
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:38,219
um but you had mentioned that you saw

1648
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:40,920
better results related to

1649
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:43,980
um soil applications with some of these

1650
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:47,460
you know Sands and things because of the

1651
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:49,979
the biology I believe

1652
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:53,760
right yep

1653
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:55,500
so the micro the microbiome we don't

1654
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,360
we're not even scratching the surface

1655
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:00,658
with our understanding of silicon

1656
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:03,019
weathering and movement between all the

1657
01:11:00,658 --> 01:11:07,920
different aspects within the rhizosphere

1658
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:10,560
within the bacteria and within the plant

1659
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,340
so we may see some sort of

1660
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,360
um

1661
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:17,819
SI solubilizing bacteria or archaea

1662
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,380
commercially produced down the road

1663
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:22,380
correct

1664
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:24,659
um what's interesting

1665
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,060
they're they're likely already there so

1666
01:11:24,658 --> 01:11:29,158
the bacillus species that everybody has

1667
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,159
come to know and love

1668
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:34,559
um a lot of these rhizosphere

1669
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:36,599
um species that we're already using as

1670
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,719
inoculum are the ones that have been

1671
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:42,719
identified as being important in the

1672
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:45,899
Silicon mineralization within soils

1673
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:49,380
so it is likely that we're already

1674
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:51,779
putting the potential in there as

1675
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:53,699
um silicate mineralizers now we just

1676
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:55,679
have to give them the food to help them

1677
01:11:53,698 --> 01:11:57,658
break that down even further so you can

1678
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:01,679
actually you can have that continual

1679
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:04,079
release and that beneficial response

1680
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,319
um from the nutrient

1681
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,698
see we use a very fine rock dust and a

1682
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:11,279
couple different sources of rock dust

1683
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:13,799
that are pretty high in uh

1684
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,238
silicon as well

1685
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,699
um

1686
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:20,819
as well as a couple other things with

1687
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:23,460
the idea being because folks are reusing

1688
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:25,139
their media which is not as common in

1689
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,719
you know Horticulture and floor culture

1690
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,280
industry these things will become

1691
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:31,679
available the SI will become available

1692
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:33,779
down the road even if it's not there

1693
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,420
that first cycle

1694
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:39,619
um but that's correct and the other oh

1695
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:39,619
go ahead oh no go ahead

1696
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:46,260
well just thinking about it the rock

1697
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:48,780
does being their present

1698
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:51,000
um and with reusing the media what

1699
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:52,920
you're doing is you are supporting a

1700
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,359
microbial community that I don't think a

1701
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,420
lot of people think about that are

1702
01:12:54,359 --> 01:13:00,059
colonizing these nutrient-rich areas so

1703
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,920
you're actually selecting for the

1704
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:05,880
bacteria that are able to live and

1705
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:09,179
survive and weather that material and so

1706
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:11,400
yes as you're using it year after year

1707
01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:14,100
um the efficiency of that mineralization

1708
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:17,519
will likely increase

1709
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:20,340
um as that Source you know as they're

1710
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,620
continuing to benefit from the plants

1711
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:24,480
that are growing in there and the

1712
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:26,880
nutrients that are available and haven't

1713
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,339
been used up

1714
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,380
yeah we also use a larger volume of soil

1715
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:34,100
relative to what our soilless media

1716
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:37,140
relative to what most Growers

1717
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:39,659
traditionally would use so we're in beds

1718
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:41,760
or you know 15 20 30 gallon pots in a

1719
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:46,019
lot of cases and I think that plays a

1720
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:50,219
role in in the microbiome and we we tend

1721
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:53,159
to see our better yields in plant health

1722
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:55,319
on the second or third cycle which puts

1723
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:57,299
us you know six months four to six

1724
01:13:55,319 --> 01:14:00,539
months down the road versus that first

1725
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:03,239
uh you know 60 days 55 days that that

1726
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:04,800
initial crop is in so you know that

1727
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:06,599
would I think it's an interesting

1728
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,219
hypothesis the other thing I wonder

1729
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,960
about in terms of the research you've

1730
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:14,300
seen is these types this type of media I

1731
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,960
found you know

1732
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,000
qualitatively looking under the

1733
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:22,079
microscope tends to be more biologically

1734
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:25,500
active than traditional soils that are

1735
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:28,679
agricultural soils now I'm not

1736
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:30,960
you know doing DNA analysis on what the

1737
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:34,440
you know particular

1738
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:37,380
microbes are to a to a species but I I

1739
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:39,960
wonder if um research would show

1740
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:42,659
different results versus

1741
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:45,119
um you know more a more common soilless

1742
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:46,819
media like pro-mix or something for

1743
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:50,698
example

1744
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:52,079
well like it from what it sounds so

1745
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:54,539
pro-mix

1746
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:57,539
in the soilless media that we use

1747
01:14:54,539 --> 01:15:00,300
obviously it isn't microbial inert but

1748
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:03,060
it's nowhere near what soils are but

1749
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,940
when you're talking about a highly

1750
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:08,460
Intense or you know um

1751
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:12,000
a well-blended

1752
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:14,939
uh living soil where you are providing

1753
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,600
the nutrients you're providing the

1754
01:15:14,939 --> 01:15:22,859
environment and you know one that is a

1755
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,539
well adapted for enhancing the growth of

1756
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:27,359
these microbes the growth of the plant

1757
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:30,119
that's a lot different than a soil

1758
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,279
system where we're just applying

1759
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:35,099
fertilizer to and we're putting plants

1760
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:36,779
in the ground even though we're working

1761
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:40,260
you know

1762
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:41,759
we can be putting in compost that to me

1763
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:44,460
it sounds like these types of living

1764
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,140
soils are a little bit more calculated

1765
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:49,760
and more balanced than what you would

1766
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:52,199
see out in atypical

1767
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,179
agriculture soil so the fact that you're

1768
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:56,158
seeing

1769
01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:59,760
more microbial

1770
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:02,339
um growth or more microbial action that

1771
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,679
excuse me that makes sense

1772
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:07,739
um obviously you know having some type

1773
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:10,199
of data to look at those two would be

1774
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:11,819
really really interesting but in essence

1775
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,979
that's you know you're just you're

1776
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:16,559
really working on creating the perfect

1777
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:17,939
environment to culture both the microbes

1778
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,460
and the plants and so you would expect

1779
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:23,579
to see I think a more dense population

1780
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:27,060
are a more efficient response within

1781
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:28,800
those types of situations

1782
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:31,440
yeah I mean I hope we see more research

1783
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,500
down the road but it's such a complex

1784
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:36,658
topic and it would be so challenging to

1785
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,880
research anyway just because there's

1786
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:41,579
going to be so much variability uh at

1787
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,679
the microbial level right

1788
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:47,880
um I don't know if we'll ever get there

1789
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:50,460
but yeah no no I'm sure people will try

1790
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,679
and come up with really great inferences

1791
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,719
from that but you're absolutely correct

1792
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:57,420
when you try to control the variables or

1793
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,698
you know to be able to even start to

1794
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:02,640
compare studies to one another it's

1795
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:05,519
going to be a huge challenge

1796
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:09,239
yeah well I'm I'm super excited you've

1797
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:11,159
really inspired me to uh revisit uh

1798
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:14,279
silicon and how I might be able to

1799
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:15,479
better utilize it in my garden and uh I

1800
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:17,658
really just thank you for your time

1801
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:17,658
today

1802
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,400
you are absolutely welcome and if

1803
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,679
there's anything that I can help

1804
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:27,238
yourself or your viewers please just

1805
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,940
reach out

1806
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:32,339
um I'm always open to sharing any and

1807
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:36,059
all information that I've got through

1808
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:38,219
these past 17 years with whoever is

1809
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,620
interested in learning about it

1810
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:43,380
great well I'll put some uh you know

1811
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:44,819
some links and information

1812
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:47,520
um I think what would be really useful

1813
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:49,979
is a a conversion chart if those are

1814
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,600
available so folks could easily compare

1815
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:54,000
products

1816
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,699
um and yeah hopefully as more research
