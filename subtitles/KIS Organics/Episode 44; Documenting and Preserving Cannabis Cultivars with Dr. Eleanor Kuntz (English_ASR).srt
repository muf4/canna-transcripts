00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,340
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,920
science podcast

4
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,230
I'm your host tad hussy of kiss organics

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,000
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,070
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,778
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,820
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,859
share their wisdom and knowledge now

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,140
before starting this week's podcast I

11
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,149
have a couple of quick announcements

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,100
this is episode 44 at the time of this

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,620
recording it's been an amazing journey

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,359
and I've met some incredible people the

15
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,979
goal was to really create a platform to

16
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,159
help bridge the gap between cannabis

17
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,378
cultivation and science so far I've done

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,119
all of this for free putting in hundreds

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,460
of hours with the goal of sharing this

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,409
information and also helping people find

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,579
out about me and my company it's been

22
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,558
really rewarding

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,359
however due to work demands and

24
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,329
financial constraints I'm reaching out

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,700
now for two reasons in order to keep the

26
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,340
podcast going for free I'm adding a

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,978
patreon page and also some short ads in

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,200
the podcast themselves the patreon page

29
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,959
allows listeners to donate at a monthly

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,060
tier level starting at only $1.00 with

31
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,919
other tiers offering a monthly private

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,469
Google hangout group and even the

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,329
ability to co-host an episode if you've

34
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,250
learned something from this podcast and

35
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:35,039
want to support it this is your chance

36
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:38,129
go to WWE tree on Comm backslash ki s

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,840
organics to check it out I'm also going

38
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:41,879
to be adding short sponsorships or

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,978
advertisements to the podcast itself to

40
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,599
help cover the time and costs I'm going

41
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,340
to be really selective though about what

42
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,408
companies I work with and we'll only

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,259
have products and services that I would

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,790
use in my own personal garden thank you

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,259
for understanding and support of the

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,049
show let's get back to this week's

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,718
interviews my guest this week is Eleanor

48
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,159
Koons Eleanor is a trained herbalist and

49
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,349
geneticist bridging the gap between

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,560
traditional herbalism and modern science

51
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:09,598
she is co-founder of candor the people's

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,370
herbarium the first herbarium committed

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,619
to documenting and preserving cannabis

54
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,030
cultivars and varieties

55
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,769
along with the collective knowledge

56
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,628
gained through a community engagement

57
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,789
you could read more about Eleanor's

58
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:22,039
extensive educational and experiential

59
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,030
background on the podcast page as it's

60
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,039
more than I can share in this

61
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,689
introduction I was honored to get her on

62
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,250
the show to talk about the importance of

63
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,590
her variants and how they relate to

64
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,729
cannabis

65
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,830
hey Nora thanks for coming on the show

66
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,268
today

67
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,049
hey Todd thanks for having me it's great

68
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:38,209
to be here

69
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:41,060
yeah can we start off giving listeners a

70
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,039
little bit of a little bit of a

71
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,379
background into sort of your life and

72
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:51,229
how you came to have this role with the

73
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:53,299
with candor yes oh my my life has been a

74
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:55,848
walk through a lot of different jobs in

75
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:58,129
the plant world I started off as a

76
00:02:55,848 --> 00:03:00,889
florist in high school and I've kind of

77
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:03,859
been chasing various realms of the plant

78
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:07,518
world since then I did my undergraduate

79
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:11,629
degrees in BA and biology at Smith

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,069
College and then went on really to do

81
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,989
some work fundamental work on

82
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,750
systematics through a really nice

83
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,049
internship at Q garden and that sort of

84
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,959
set the stage for my interest in plant

85
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:26,930
taxonomy and plant biodiversity and how

86
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:31,759
that biodiversity is spread across the

87
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,560
globe and from there I did a lot of kind

88
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,078
of odd jobs and things but then found

89
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,840
myself back in graduate school focusing

90
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:41,629
on plant genetics in particular plant

91
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,629
population genetics really looking at

92
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:48,979
how populations of plants are influenced

93
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:51,318
by movement so invasive species biology

94
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:54,679
and how our cultivated plants in

95
00:03:51,318 --> 00:04:00,138
particular are affected by movement of

96
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:03,349
weady sister species and pests so a lot

97
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,389
of different things so you have a

98
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:10,009
bachelors in biology with a focus in

99
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:13,930
botany and then you also have a pH PhD

100
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:16,969
it looks like to in you said genetics

101
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,329
yes and my PhD in genetics and my focus

102
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:23,240
has always been on plant systems now in

103
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,400
addition to this you also apparently

104
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,120
graduated from the sage Mountain School

105
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,918
of herbals

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,090
so you have a background in herbology

107
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,740
too is that right yes before I went back

108
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:35,750
to graduate school I was unsure of

109
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,990
exactly the direction I wanted to take

110
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,500
and I took a wonderful little detour in

111
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,449
queue the herbal world and in a very

112
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,569
focused and pointed way studying to

113
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,460
become a trained herbalist I really

114
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,800
deepened my connection to the plants

115
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:54,459
through that particular educational

116
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,228
experience there on sage mountain and

117
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:59,719
he's knowing myself and looking at

118
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:02,300
myself I realized that my love of the

119
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,620
plant in the herbalism world really came

120
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,319
from the perspective of the plant

121
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,840
whereas I I enjoyed the power the plants

122
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,409
have to heal us my particular interest

123
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,089
wasn't in helping sick people but was in

124
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,880
helping those plants which helped us

125
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:19,250
become well once I really started to

126
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,139
focus on the health of the ecosystems

127
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,478
and the plants that we were sourcing for

128
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,680
our herbal medicine

129
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:29,120
Wow so you have this fascinating

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,490
background and education level and from

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,930
that it sounds like you founded this

132
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:39,710
company called candor yes so can ya

133
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:42,740
candor is a nonprofit that we started

134
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:45,439
actually and mostly spending my

135
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,650
day-to-day running a company called leaf

136
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,788
works which is a botanical

137
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:52,879
identification company so we really

138
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:55,159
focus on identifying plants for the

139
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,529
natural products world and for

140
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,750
compliance and you know fidelity not

141
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:02,089
only in packaging and labeling but also

142
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,529
in supply chain security so are you

143
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,989
really buying the plants you think

144
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:09,019
you're buying and that's where we sort

145
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,348
of came to the party about five years

146
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:15,139
ago when we were doing a lot of

147
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:17,719
identification and realized that with a

148
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,490
lot of our friends and some of my deep

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,039
family members that had been working in

150
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,370
cannabis for a long time a lot of the

151
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:28,009
tools and reference materials that you

152
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,470
would need to really make good science

153
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,240
happen and to make good identification

154
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,729
happen weren't available

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,329
Corino many many reasons which we can go

156
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:39,930
into and so that's how we came to the

157
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:44,689
necessity to found

158
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:48,449
gender really as a landing place to

159
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:50,418
understand the diversity and types that

160
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:55,650
we have within the cannabis community

161
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:59,189
okay so what exactly is a herbarium so

162
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:01,019
an herbarium is a repository it's a it's

163
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,110
a location and a place that holds

164
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:07,198
collections of preserved plant specimens

165
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,939
and then associated data that are linked

166
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,889
to those plant specimens and they're

167
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,370
used for mole of you know multiple

168
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:18,269
purpose the most primary purpose is when

169
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,300
you find a new species or develop a new

170
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:24,209
cultivar an herbarium is the repository

171
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,780
by which you would press a sample of

172
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:29,489
that plant describe that plant and then

173
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,879
that would be used as the reference

174
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,250
sample to then move forward with any

175
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,709
kind of research so you know if you

176
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,689
discover a new species of flower you're

177
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:41,370
going to make a species description and

178
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:44,728
that species description is going to be

179
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,158
linked to at least one preserved plant

180
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:50,728
specimen and herbarium pressing of that

181
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:52,949
plant and if you are then looking at how

182
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,509
that plant is distributed across space

183
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,300
so let's say you're looking at dandelion

184
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,829
and it's all across the you know Europe

185
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,770
in addition to North America you can

186
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:04,589
look at how dandelion differs from place

187
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:07,348
to place based on voucher specimens that

188
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:09,149
have been taken in different areas so

189
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:11,639
there's kind of two levels of utility

190
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,918
for an herbarium the most prime areas

191
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,288
you know defining type and sort of

192
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,120
getting everyone on the same page so you

193
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:21,120
know when we say gala Apple everyone

194
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,530
knows what a gala Apple is and how it's

195
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,689
different from something like a Granny

196
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:29,668
Smith you know I'm making that name have

197
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:31,560
meaning in a biological sense and then

198
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:34,978
on that second level we can then see

199
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,599
okay if we grow Gala apples and 17

200
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,849
different kinds of environments how do

201
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,690
those environments affect the Apple

202
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:45,028
itself yeah so that kind of you kind of

203
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,680
answered my next question which was sort

204
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:49,139
of like how do when we talk about

205
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:52,979
different chemo type expressions of the

206
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,559
same cultivar which cannabis is shown to

207
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,330
expell

208
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,019
express itself quite differently across

209
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,580
different environments what your what

210
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,039
you're doing then if I understand

211
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,620
correctly is sort of giving us a context

212
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:09,879
for that conversation by giving us a

213
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,589
starting point absolutely absolutely so

214
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,809
in that first level just making

215
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:15,279
definitions you know we have individuals

216
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:17,139
that have been stewarding plants and

217
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,990
have been doing breeding and I've been

218
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,419
caretaking particular clones for a very

219
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,430
long time and individuals who've worked

220
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:26,829
with specific plants really have an idea

221
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:28,359
of what is the essence of that plant

222
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,009
what is the chemistry what is it

223
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,019
structure what is the production

224
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,179
qualities what kinds of environments is

225
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:37,240
it excel in like we have this knowledge

226
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:41,319
and so it's really a repository by which

227
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,690
we can link that information to a

228
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,640
physical representation of that thing

229
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,220
and then we know that if we move that

230
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,139
thing from place to place it does that

231
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,290
you know the chemistry is going to

232
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:55,210
change in a lot of ways like that a lot

233
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:56,500
of the flower color changes right we

234
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,470
know a lot of different kinds of

235
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,059
cultivars or cannabis types that will

236
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,560
express these beautiful purples and

237
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,779
pinks if they're exposed to cold

238
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,549
temperatures and they won't if you you

239
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,789
know grow them indoors and a more even

240
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:12,909
in mild climate so monitoring how those

241
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:15,009
particular tacks are the Jeanette's very

242
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:17,588
across the environment the herbarium

243
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:20,439
itself is that physical repository so

244
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:23,410
that we can really catalog how that is

245
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,960
occurring and really understand that G

246
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:28,569
by E or that genetic by environmental

247
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,240
interaction that gives us that really

248
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,360
rich and very sometimes complicated

249
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,190
phenotype that we see with cannabis so

250
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,940
what are the legal implications for a

251
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:43,060
grower in terms of preserving genetics I

252
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,459
know I'm somewhat familiar with what the

253
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,859
OCP or open cannabis project is is

254
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:50,489
attempting to do on there and with

255
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,740
intellectual property what what sort of

256
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:57,940
I guess how does how does an herbarium

257
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,278
fit into this whole landscape well an

258
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,050
herbarium is actually the most

259
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,509
fundamental and basic way in which we do

260
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:06,659
this with plants right so when we were

261
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:09,120
describing roses and then you

262
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,419
than peonies and all of the rich history

263
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,830
we have with all of these these flowers

264
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:17,000
um you know we weren't using anything

265
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:19,700
beyond an herbarium and physical

266
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,559
descriptions of these plants to really

267
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,290
dictate type or dictate you know what is

268
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,359
a Queen Anne Rose what is a you know

269
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:29,519
lady slipper pink tea rose you know all

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,070
of these different kinds of roses and so

271
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,059
the herbarium acts as a very fundamental

272
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:38,400
basic step by which a breeder can define

273
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,229
their material make a physical

274
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,829
representation of that material like an

275
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:47,730
actual tangible object that is then

276
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:50,310
linked to a description a different

277
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,259
chemistry or genetics or any other kind

278
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,409
of information can be layered on top of

279
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:58,950
that voucher specimen but the voucher is

280
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:03,360
actually the physical unit that grounds

281
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,560
that information in reality and one of

282
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,440
the things that that physical

283
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,859
representation does much like in other

284
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,040
arenas with legality it offers a point

285
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:18,600
of prior art such that you can actually

286
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:22,679
reference back to type and see if it is

287
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,029
or is not a unique object so when you're

288
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,699
talking about legal forms one of the

289
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,490
things you really need are arenas in

290
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,960
which you have information about you

291
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,000
know prior art what is in the community

292
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,670
what already exists so that you can move

293
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,529
forward with patenting or refute

294
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:45,329
patenting based on uniqueness so from a

295
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:48,809
breeder perspective by getting the their

296
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,180
plant classified with someone like your

297
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:53,849
your company with an herbarium they're

298
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:56,879
essentially preserving their preserving

299
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,629
their genetics and allowing them

300
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:04,139
potentially a way to to defend or refute

301
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:06,689
a patent on that on that final flower is

302
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,129
that essentially what you're saying yes

303
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,170
and it's actually a much more powerful

304
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:12,029
way than using genetics because of

305
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:14,250
course with genetics with all of the

306
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,620
genetic service genetic services that

307
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,720
are out there they're giving you a panel

308
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,519
of snips or a very short and small

309
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,740
window into the genome and what

310
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,569
you're working which is not an accurate

311
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,350
representation of the entirety of the

312
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,820
plant the plant itself is the most

313
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,610
complete picture of what you're trying

314
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,280
to preserve and so that becomes a

315
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,659
reference point on which all of this

316
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:40,709
additional information can be layered

317
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,299
you know if you imagine you have a

318
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,370
hundred thousand base pairs and you're

319
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:46,469
only looking at a hundred of them it's a

320
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,289
very small window into what that genome

321
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:52,019
is and that can be deceptive in

322
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:54,689
uniqueness and so the herbarium itself

323
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:58,289
you know grounds that in reality within

324
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:01,680
an object that is tangible and real so

325
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:03,959
really what an herbarium does is it it

326
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,759
gives you sort of a historical context

327
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,060
like I'm I'm thinking of Linnaeus when

328
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,799
you say herbarium sort of this taxonomy

329
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:14,250
process of identifying really dating

330
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,500
back historically quite far and that

331
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,620
would be sort of the foundation then for

332
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,450
which intellectual property or genetics

333
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,980
could then come into play around a

334
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,110
particular cultivar exactly yeah that's

335
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,340
exactly the case and I think it's an

336
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,090
interesting thing when we talk about

337
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,740
cultivar because in plants it's it's a

338
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,680
very difficult concept to even wrap my

339
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,590
own head around but genetics does not

340
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:43,019
define cultivar it never has and it's

341
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:46,019
actually a very inappropriate way to

342
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:49,949
define cultivar because we have many

343
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,860
cultivars that have disparate genetic

344
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,980
backgrounds that are that are considered

345
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,750
the same cultivar and so banana is a

346
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,870
really good example of this where the

347
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,090
ladyfinger banana that we grow you know

348
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,159
in many different locations across the

349
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,170
globe and is what services our banana

350
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,299
intake I think the bananas we buy at the

351
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:13,049
grocery store is this cultivar banana

352
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:15,269
you know in in the majority and that

353
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,219
particular banana is a cross between two

354
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,230
different kinds of banana and there's a

355
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,899
lot of genetic diversity and mom and dad

356
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,570
and it doesn't matter you know which

357
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,939
individual from those populations you're

358
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,850
using it's the cross itself that makes

359
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,640
banana and so the genetics behind that

360
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,440
cross are exceptionally variable so you

361
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,870
have the situation where different Jin

362
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,870
medic backgrounds produce the same

363
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,929
cultivar and then you have the converse

364
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,940
example where I know most of us have

365
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:47,549
witnessed this where we have a rose or

366
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,530
some kind of plant in our garden where

367
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:52,139
all of a sudden the single sector of

368
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:54,659
that plant will look different

369
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,449
it will either have modelled leaves or a

370
00:15:54,659 --> 00:16:00,259
red rose we'll all of a sudden turn into

371
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,580
a rose that has white stripes on it and

372
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,009
it'll low it'll be located on the same

373
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,410
plant and if you take a cutting of that

374
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:09,569
sector that is different you know it's

375
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:12,029
the same genome it's the same individual

376
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,960
it's almost the most identical you can

377
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:17,909
possibly get and you can clone that

378
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,129
differential sector and call it a new

379
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:22,980
cultivar right cuz it's different than

380
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:27,450
the parent even though the genetics are

381
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:31,289
99.9 percent the same and so genetics

382
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,840
itself is a very is not the most

383
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:36,589
reliable way to define cultivar

384
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,950
cultivars this entire picture of a plant

385
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:43,170
not just as its genetic background so if

386
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:46,940
I understand you correctly you're saying

387
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:50,370
that a different genetic expression of

388
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,160
essentially the same genotype with maybe

389
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,179
just one small mutation would create a

390
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:59,250
whole new cultivar and so yeah in your

391
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,349
second example so I'm just trying to

392
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,450
wrap my brain around all of this because

393
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:08,400
you're throwing a lot of information out

394
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:11,818
so all that being said essentially what

395
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:16,170
you're saying is that a cultivar is not

396
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:18,899
a cultivar is not its genetic makeup in

397
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,640
in holes only so there's more to it than

398
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,660
that

399
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,750
mmm-hmm there's much more to it than I

400
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,420
and the cultivars is is driven by human

401
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,880
selection and human definition which is

402
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,529
why the mission of the herbarium is so

403
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,380
much found in the mission of kandar's

404
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:36,539
really founded in taking the knowledge

405
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,370
from the community to define the

406
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,930
cultivars that they've enduring because

407
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:43,619
they know those plants better than

408
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:45,390
anybody else and genetics alone are not

409
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,369
the units that define what those

410
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,620
cultivars are

411
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:51,659
and in the context of cannabis I'm sure

412
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:54,089
we can all think of certain plants you

413
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,830
know are going to be clone only you know

414
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,539
there's only one Harlequin if you want

415
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:00,119
Harlequin you have to have a cutting of

416
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,440
that plant to have that cultivar but

417
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,449
then there are other plants where you

418
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,130
know it's a it's a cross it's a certain

419
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,690
cross that happens over and over and the

420
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,490
exact in those background of that cross

421
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,920
isn't what's important but it's who's a

422
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,529
mom and who's the dad and how that cross

423
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,860
plays out within that seed stock becomes

424
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:19,500
a cultivar so it's tricky

425
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,959
yeah well cannabis is this it's this

426
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,819
beautiful mess of diversity in genetics

427
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,539
right now I feel like and we don't have

428
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:30,809
any idea really what what we have as an

429
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,460
industry and I think we I think we're in

430
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,609
desperate need of some classifications

431
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,190
in a lot of ways because even even the

432
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:39,659
known genetics that are out there you

433
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,759
know people are constantly breeding

434
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,080
there we're getting new expressions of

435
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,200
those genetics

436
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,849
we're losing genetics all the time so

437
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,490
something like this would just would be

438
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:52,619
a way to take sort of a snapshot of one

439
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,130
particular are you calling them

440
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:57,750
cultivars then is that the best

441
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,610
nomenclature when talking about us yeah

442
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,190
I'm a plant biologist so I default to

443
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:05,369
that because for me that is what you

444
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:08,519
called a plant type so I I called them

445
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:10,379
cultivars I know that the the community

446
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,259
itself really likes the word strain for

447
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,730
me that's a microbiological organism so

448
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,920
I have a hard time calling the plant

449
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,660
that but I think we're all talking about

450
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,320
the same thing those units that hold

451
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,300
together as you know an essence of a

452
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,470
thing you know what we say chem dog we

453
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,730
know what we're talking about when we

454
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,829
see Harlequin you know what we're

455
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,660
talking about and you know in the

456
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:33,869
diversity that is surrounded in that

457
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:38,610
name I think really is the community's

458
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:40,259
job to come to that assessment okay so

459
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:42,689
can you explain to me how can there

460
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,250
might help the cannabis community sort

461
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,430
of document this biodiversity that

462
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,799
they're holding on to absolutely so

463
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,049
right now we're really pushing with our

464
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:55,079
our breeder allies and our breeder

465
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:57,000
friends who's been doing a bulk of you

466
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,970
know both of the work to really generate

467
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,650
new types and then also distribute those

468
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,049
types

469
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:06,710
differential farmers you know so we're

470
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:09,829
those those units are being developed is

471
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,079
our first entry into definition until

472
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:14,689
working with them to define their plants

473
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,579
make vouchers and then really follow

474
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:20,480
those types through the community and

475
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:22,759
different growing arenas you can you can

476
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,599
track not only that the sort of gold

477
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:29,089
standard of what that cultivar is but

478
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,919
then how growing it amongst different

479
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:34,099
farmers affects the type and the

480
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,289
herbarium itself becomes the resource by

481
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:39,669
which we can sort of hold that

482
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:42,680
information as a community and learn

483
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:46,279
where those boundaries are and how you

484
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,990
know we do get this diversity when we

485
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,970
grow things in different areas but the

486
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,160
herbarium itself is exactly as you put

487
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:55,150
it the container that holds that

488
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,950
information so that we can do not only

489
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:03,320
good science but also have names and

490
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,269
titles that make sense and are grounded

491
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,849
in the history of what happens with

492
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:10,910
those plants so can you take me through

493
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:13,369
the process of how a grower would would

494
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:18,200
work with with candor with this

495
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:21,319
herbarium absolutely so we visit farms

496
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,430
and right now we're visiting a lot of

497
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:28,609
mother rooms and we're taking cultivar

498
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:31,250
intake would include taking a vegetative

499
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:33,799
cutting of about 10 to 12 inches of the

500
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,369
plant and then physically pressing that

501
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,919
vegetative cutting it's done in a very

502
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:41,779
special cotton paper that's going to

503
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,920
preserve that plant for a very long time

504
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:49,069
you meant in Linnaeus earlier and he's

505
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,670
actually the human that did the type

506
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:54,529
specimen for cannabis and that pressing

507
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,850
we actually have up on our Instagram and

508
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,619
we'll probably repost it in the BIC so

509
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:01,009
it's a beautiful example of an art very

510
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:03,229
impressing but that's exactly what we do

511
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:06,230
we take a vegetative pressing and then

512
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,160
we'll also take a flowering pressing so

513
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,710
nothing you know you can't

514
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,420
once they're big glorious colas you know

515
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,759
it's pretty hard to get them into a two

516
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,570
dimensional form but you know that early

517
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,849
flowering

518
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:18,439
you can see flower color internodal

519
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:20,000
spacing any of the important

520
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,519
morphological characteristics that would

521
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,890
really define the type and will make a

522
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,269
pressing of that as well if we have

523
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,220
individual there's certain breeders that

524
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:31,940
we're working on like sub pools of very

525
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:34,610
active participant in the herbarium

526
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,250
right now and working with candor a lot

527
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:38,990
of his seeds our mother you know

528
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,730
specific mothers across the specific

529
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,430
fathers and so in that case we'll take

530
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,079
pressing or barium vouchers of both the

531
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,180
mother and the father and then a panel

532
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:49,519
of the of the F ones that are

533
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,700
consistently produced from that cross as

534
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,680
the definition of type and so whenever

535
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,110
we can we also include that pedigree

536
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,700
history to just preserve the entire

537
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,949
lineage of the plants as we have a

538
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,170
deeper understanding of where that plant

539
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,400
come from and how that plant holds

540
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,800
together as a unit

541
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,780
once those pressing their main the

542
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,259
breeder themselves will fill out some

543
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:16,930
informational forms about it you know

544
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:19,730
sort of basic stuff their flower color

545
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,560
spacing structure you know all those

546
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,250
characteristics about that plant that's

547
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,769
fine who that individual is so there's

548
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,650
some authorship in there too so you

549
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:32,539
mentioned that appeal I think and so it

550
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,350
would it would be his name on that page

551
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:39,170
associated with that particular flower

552
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:40,639
yes yep and then we have certain

553
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,230
individuals who know that our steward in

554
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,240
plants and it's you know maybe the

555
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,460
original breeder has since passed or

556
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,250
maybe it's been held in community so

557
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,680
long it's really hard to tag who is the

558
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,539
quote owner and we have a little visitor

559
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,390
plants this is a very typical thing the

560
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:59,420
carrier plants with us so it's almost an

561
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,640
odd thing to assign ownership to plants

562
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,240
but with those individuals that have a

563
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,340
more historical presence in the

564
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,250
community what you basically are doing

565
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:11,990
are offering stewardship and so you

566
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,220
might not be saying this is my plant but

567
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,039
you're saying I have skewered in this

568
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,779
plant since 82 this is where I got this

569
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,220
plant this is the history of this plant

570
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:21,289
this is who you know so you can

571
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,720
corroborate type in that way too and

572
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:26,599
historical framework where you know

573
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,730
whoever is donating that Wouter

574
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,129
aside you know signing their name that

575
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,569
they're donating it but then you know

576
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,220
that doesn't have to be the original

577
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:36,519
breeder it can be someone who's really

578
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,110
just worked to steward the plant as well

579
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,490
okay and so what is the cost associated

580
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:45,308
with something like this

581
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:49,910
oh goodness well right now we are all

582
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:54,649
user input so there is no initial

583
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:58,279
upfront cost to donate vouchers to the

584
00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:01,280
herbarium the herbarium itself is a

585
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:05,089
resource that is open to anyone who

586
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,308
wants to contribute and the work is done

587
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:09,379
by that individual to make that

588
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:11,779
contribution and we facilitate that work

589
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:16,730
at the herbarium there is no auxilary

590
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:18,408
cost right now and structuring sort of

591
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,140
data basing and things to make the

592
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:23,179
information more accessible there will

593
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,140
probably be a membership fee but that

594
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:30,110
will come once we have a platform to

595
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,730
really share that with so we can you

596
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:34,459
know open it up to the community to have

597
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:37,700
a little more access right now it's

598
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,548
really about amassing that fundamental

599
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,548
information from that you know voucher

600
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:48,019
that like breeder level to really have a

601
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:50,658
running start to get the you know the

602
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:54,470
resource to a point where it has a lot

603
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:55,760
of utility for the greater community so

604
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,120
you're right now you're in the stage of

605
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:01,220
collecting samples it sounds like and

606
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:03,739
what is the end goal of the herbarium

607
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:07,640
that once you have sort of a mass this

608
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:11,630
this huge library of genetics in this

609
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,549
form the end goal is really to have a

610
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,210
resource by which that we can have

611
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:19,009
cultivar convention and have you know

612
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,509
select panels of people who've been

613
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,009
working with these plants or who are the

614
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:24,529
original breeders really come to the

615
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:26,990
table and make coats of our conventions

616
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:29,149
such that we can move the the community

617
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,339
itself can move their own their own

618
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:35,298
naming system forward and really be in

619
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:37,399
control of that much like you know the

620
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:39,109
Westminster Abbey dog show does for dogs

621
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,080
or canines where there's judgement about

622
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:42,599
who

623
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,970
Best in Show who's best in each class of

624
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,779
dog breeds it's kind of the same thing

625
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,940
that we're trying to grow the structure

626
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:53,369
around so that the community can do the

627
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,930
same kind of work where we have you know

628
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:59,279
our different breeds or our different

629
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:01,769
cultivars in in units such that everyone

630
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,509
has some basic agreement okay getting

631
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:06,269
everyone to agree is always a challenge

632
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:09,329
but getting to the point where we at

633
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:11,639
least have classes of you know what our

634
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,869
Hays is what are our cush types what our

635
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,920
you know all of these different groups

636
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:21,359
and then that resource itself can be the

637
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:24,060
functional tool to solve maybe disputes

638
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:26,669
or to really come to terms with what is

639
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:29,960
appropriate you know it's it's much

640
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:32,370
easier to have an argument or move

641
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,799
discussion forward when you have

642
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:37,439
something to point to something to

643
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,899
reference and so the herbarium wants to

644
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,580
act as that touch to move the

645
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,390
conversation forward in a productive way

646
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:46,279
based on real things as opposed to your

647
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,020
sand story

648
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,539
so you mentioned Hayes's so let's let's

649
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:54,299
use that as an example so in theory if

650
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:56,759
you had say five hundred or a thousand

651
00:27:54,299 --> 00:28:00,329
samples of various Hayes's you could

652
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,339
then take an unknown cultivar or unknown

653
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:05,789
sample and compare it to that and say oh

654
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:07,789
this is this is of Hayes ancestry most

655
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:10,289
likely based on these morphological

656
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:12,750
characteristics like inner note spacing

657
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:16,349
or leaf shape or growth habit or that

658
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:18,240
sort of thing absolutely that's exactly

659
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:20,339
what you do and you know the more

660
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,109
historical Hayes accessions that you

661
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:24,990
have or vouchers that you have that

662
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:28,079
links back to particular breeders in

663
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,029
particular collective then you can go on

664
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,189
and do exactly what you say take an

665
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:33,930
unknown and then compare it to really

666
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,320
figure out how does it fit into that

667
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:40,650
context into that framework is it is it

668
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,909
a member of that group or not yeah so I

669
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,470
see I see this as being really

670
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,420
fascinating and I think it's something I

671
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,480
would that would be wonderful to look at

672
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,680
in a museum especially getting to see

673
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,559
all of these different samples

674
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,279
throughout various generations and just

675
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,139
how many

676
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,839
different ways this plant has been bred

677
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,060
and expressed I still don't feel like I

678
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,279
have a complete grasp though of how this

679
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,529
how this relates to breeders in relation

680
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,740
to intellectual property because I know

681
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:10,319
that's a huge concern right now in terms

682
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,089
of preserving genetics either from the

683
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,609
perspective of profiting off those

684
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:17,129
genetics or from the perspective of

685
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:19,559
sharing those genetics like what the OCP

686
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,250
is attempting to do how does that relate

687
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:23,460
cuz it's still a little confusing to me

688
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,059
yeah

689
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:29,069
so the OCP is really focusing on data so

690
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:33,539
the problem with data is that data

691
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:35,519
ownership is not truly linked to the

692
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,460
individual that generates the data for

693
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,700
example any one of us can go to a

694
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,960
dispensary and buy any number of plants

695
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,460
in the form of flower and sequence them

696
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,269
that does not mean that any of us own

697
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,529
those plants right we've just like if I

698
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:55,369
went to the grocery store I bought a

699
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:58,889
gala Apple and I sequence gala Apple

700
00:29:55,369 --> 00:30:03,379
doesn't mean I own gala Apple and so the

701
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:06,090
amount of sequence data in the general

702
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,830
populace on GenBank or NCBI

703
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:10,409
through the oakland cannabis project or

704
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:12,179
whatever gives information to

705
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,370
individuals about the diversity of

706
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,519
cannabis that's out there but it does

707
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:22,379
nothing to link genetics to tangible

708
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:25,109
plants there's no reference point so if

709
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,180
I would just to take a step back as a

710
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:30,809
scientist if I'm going to go and study a

711
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:33,210
kanesha the first thing I'm going to do

712
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,009
if I want to make some kind of

713
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,779
assessments about the genetics of a

714
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:39,890
Canisius I'm going to go to an herbarium

715
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:43,230
and get a bunch of different akinesia

716
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,660
vouchers from you know the eight most

717
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,940
prevalent species of a kanesha's are in

718
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,550
my area and I'm going to use those

719
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,680
tangible voucher specimens as my

720
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,129
reference point for the science I'm

721
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,019
doing and that's what's missing is the

722
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,260
tangible reference point that links

723
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:06,349
abstract data which is genetic a CPG

724
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:06,349
kind of data to a real living organism

725
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:12,060
and so that's that's you know there's a

726
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:18,509
lot of different ways to encourage

727
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:22,339
emetic or you know IP but having the

728
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:25,190
genetic data linked to a real plant is a

729
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:27,509
fundamental importance to generate IP

730
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,630
because without the ownership of the

731
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:33,119
plant like genetic data is just genetic

732
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:36,120
data anyone can generate that does that

733
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,289
answer your question at all I think so

734
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,949
I'm still trying to wrap my brain around

735
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:43,259
it so it's a little confusing in my head

736
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:46,350
no matter what but essentially if I

737
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,670
understand you correctly what you're

738
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:51,569
saying is there needs to be a link

739
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:53,640
between what we're getting is from a lab

740
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:55,649
analysis and then the actual physical

741
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,440
plant itself so what I'm trying to

742
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,400
figure out is if I'm if I'm a breeder

743
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,200
and I want to preserve these genetics

744
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,390
from let's say let's say purely a

745
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,860
financial perspective

746
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,110
profit off of these genetics because

747
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,750
I've created a plant that has these

748
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:16,169
characteristics or this particular

749
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:18,769
genotype mm-hmm how does I guess how

750
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,360
does the OCP fit in and then how does

751
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,519
Kandor fit in what's sort of the

752
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:27,509
difference is there and what's the

753
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,369
importance well candor is going to be

754
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:32,339
the location where you would physically

755
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:34,529
define that plant and then make her your

756
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:38,129
physical pressings of that plant to

757
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:41,670
define type and then from that point on

758
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:43,200
any any definition that you know in the

759
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,120
individual breeder who's making that

760
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,009
accession is gonna keep copies of those

761
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:51,689
vouchers as well right so if I make it

762
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:53,579
let's say you have made you know purple

763
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,309
cherrybrook drop number two that's your

764
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:58,409
new plant you're gonna you're gonna make

765
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,759
a voucher I'm gonna keep one of the

766
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,440
herbarium it's going to be held in

767
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,119
posterity as a reference point and then

768
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,150
you're also going to keep that voucher

769
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:08,819
for yourself and then as these vouchers

770
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,860
build up it becomes a resource to the

771
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:14,039
Patent Office that when they are looking

772
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:17,219
for definitions of type 2 C is a unique

773
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,079
and plant I am not a lawyer and so the

774
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,640
intricacies of plant patenting is

775
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,089
exceptionally difficult and

776
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,890
it is very difficult to patent a plant

777
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:29,099
normally to patent a plant you have to

778
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:31,530
genetically modify it if you want to get

779
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,939
a varietal patent so that's the

780
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:35,399
difference between a cultivar and a

781
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,360
variety a variety is just a flavor of

782
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:44,780
cultivar that has a legal framework

783
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:48,139
around it like gala or arctic apple

784
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:51,180
would be a genetically modified variety

785
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:54,150
and so it's it's actually very difficult

786
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,400
to patent a plant itself but if you

787
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:59,540
wanted to define that cultivar the

788
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,340
physical representation is your first

789
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:04,379
step and then if you're going to do any

790
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:06,389
kind of genetic or chemistry you would

791
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,260
layer that on top of that physical

792
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:12,809
voucher as you know definitive of that

793
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,280
voucher right because you can have two

794
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:15,509
very different plants that if you're

795
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,570
just so that you're just looking at

796
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,830
chemistry can come up the same you know

797
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,240
and it doesn't mean that those plants

798
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:24,719
are the same just because the the

799
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:27,509
handful of 10 chemicals you're looking

800
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:33,119
at in a you know pantheon of the 500

801
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:35,159
chemicals happens to be similar so the

802
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,549
Oct is really from my understanding

803
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,740
really amassing data such that there's

804
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:46,580
more information in the academic

805
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:50,099
community to really get at diversity and

806
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:51,750
you know those types of questions well

807
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,159
I'll have to get Beth on the show here

808
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,260
to sort of explain a little more about

809
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,289
the OCP so I won't know I won't expect

810
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,770
you to explain about another program but

811
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:03,630
I do think that's really interesting so

812
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:05,909
you've mentioned apples

813
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,260
you know I would just I would say let's

814
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:10,500
stick with that example maybe with a

815
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:14,010
Honey Crisp apple for example so if I

816
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,519
created Honey Crisp you know I would

817
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:20,640
then go to an apple or barium and give

818
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:23,219
them again a pressing or a voucher of

819
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,679
that Honey Crisp apple and then from

820
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:27,929
there would I also go and get the

821
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:31,949
genetics done on an apple and at that

822
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:33,750
point what I own that particular IP or

823
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:34,289
how does that work I guess it's not

824
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,480
really

825
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:39,029
at that point yeah so what you do is you

826
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,590
would really so yeah so the PME society

827
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,630
has a really good forum if you google

828
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,920
keone society and they have new varietal

829
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,110
submission or new clothes of our

830
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,690
submission and basically what you do is

831
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,460
you would describe that Apple you would

832
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,559
describe why it is different what are

833
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,079
the unique attributes of that Apple so

834
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,509
you know maybe sugar content it might be

835
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,369
time to flower it might be height of the

836
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,950
tree you know if it's not a grafted

837
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:06,239
apple with most of them are you know it

838
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:10,230
might be of course flavor profile color

839
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,819
of the skin shelf-life time time to

840
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,519
ripening all of these characteristics

841
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:18,510
would be included in that definition and

842
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:20,670
then your consortium or your your group

843
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,230
so for peony that's the peony Society

844
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,349
for apples I'm sure they have their own

845
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,449
Society and they would make a judgment

846
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,849
is this a unique thing that deserves a

847
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:31,559
title in enough of itself right does it

848
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:33,210
deserve to be a named thing that is

849
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,150
unique and different from the rest of

850
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,190
the cultivars that we have in that Apple

851
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,840
come you know in that Apple group and if

852
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,369
it's deemed to be unique then it would

853
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,380
have its own name assigned to it and

854
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:46,139
those definitions would then be attached

855
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,599
to that name there is no need to do

856
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:51,179
genetics genetics is never in the

857
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,719
history of cultivars been a definite

858
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:56,129
defining and like the way you define

859
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,230
something I mean genetics is really

860
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:01,380
modern and cultivars and a concept of

861
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:04,860
cultivars is really old so it's kind of

862
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,769
a we're in an interesting place in time

863
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:12,150
where we are using modern technologies

864
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:15,239
for things um it's kind of overkill in a

865
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,829
lot of ways and not just Edmund I mean

866
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:18,869
I'm a geneticist it's not to pooh-pooh

867
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:20,880
genetics genetics are amazing and

868
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,539
powerful we can learn all kinds of

869
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,090
things from genetics but they aren't the

870
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:31,500
primary tool to do this work and they

871
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:34,769
never have been so from an ownership or

872
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:38,130
property perspective they're an

873
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:40,110
herbarium makes a lot more sense yeah it

874
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:44,550
makes a lot more sense especially as a

875
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:48,140
first pass because it's very very basic

876
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:51,170
and it is very attainable for anyone

877
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:53,359
there's no big cost there's no special

878
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:56,869
equipment there's no relying on anyone

879
00:37:53,360 --> 00:38:01,539
elses analysis or data panel you know

880
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:04,279
marker set it is very very

881
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:05,960
straightforward this is my plant I'm

882
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,910
going to voucher it and then any of

883
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,579
those other technologies that you may

884
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:13,429
feel are beneficial to additionally

885
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:15,529
describe your material just as you know

886
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:19,039
it's just like icing on that cake just

887
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,310
adds to your definition that makes more

888
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,489
sense

889
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:24,799
so you're the foundation and then having

890
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:26,509
other things like the genetic makeup of

891
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,030
the genotype of that plan and even it's

892
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:32,060
maybe even it's chemo type expression

893
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,690
would be more assertions to support your

894
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:37,219
ownership of this unique cultivar

895
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,260
exactly exactly

896
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:41,959
and when synthetics I mean most of the

897
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,660
time like to get ownership of plant

898
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,210
material you actually have to physically

899
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:48,949
change the genetics of the plant and

900
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,079
most of our breeders aren't doing that

901
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:53,869
we're not using modern genetic

902
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:57,579
techniques to and in in most of our

903
00:38:53,869 --> 00:39:00,019
classic community breeding to do that

904
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:04,099
and so I think that there's also like a

905
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:06,829
little bit of false hope that genetics

906
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:10,599
gives to people of surrounding ownership

907
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:13,279
that isn't completely based in reality

908
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,079
ok so just thinking this through what's

909
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,540
to prevent someone from bringing a

910
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,610
cultivar to you that maybe they did not

911
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:23,690
breed themselves maybe it originally was

912
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:26,240
a haze or a blueberry or something like

913
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,909
that and then claiming authorship of it

914
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,649
because they were the first ones to get

915
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:33,440
it into whatever accepted herbarium

916
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:36,079
becomes you know conventional standard

917
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,820
for the industry yeah well that's a

918
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,969
really good question that question kind

919
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,820
of persists over any of these ownership

920
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:45,619
modalities or is it the first-to-file is

921
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,440
it the first sequence I mean all of

922
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:50,299
these issues are very much the same the

923
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,920
beauty of the herbarium is because it is

924
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:56,660
a community run resource those

925
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,869
accessions those inputs are vetted

926
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:01,460
against the panel and the entire group

927
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:03,960
of

928
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,900
inputs right so if we look like Hayes

929
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,570
for example or chem dog maybe is a

930
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,910
better example you know if you have

931
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,640
someone who's submitting something and

932
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:19,079
they're calling it you know by a certain

933
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:22,859
name and we are comparing it to another

934
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:27,029
thing with the same name you then look

935
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:29,099
to history and the community knowledge

936
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:32,070
of that plant to make the decision about

937
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:34,650
which type is actually accurate you know

938
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:36,450
and I am very much not the person to

939
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,579
make that decision just like I don't

940
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:40,199
think you know anyone in the genetics

941
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,789
community I don't think it's their job

942
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:44,489
to make that decision I think it really

943
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:47,849
is the community itself coming together

944
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:49,739
and arguing or whatever it is to come to

945
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:53,610
consensus about where these plants come

946
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:56,069
from and what plants are what and the

947
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:59,820
nice thing about the herbarium is those

948
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:02,000
those accessions remain and then you can

949
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:05,190
come back to them and have dialogues

950
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,949
about what is real and what is not based

951
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:11,760
on tangible pieces of evidence and

952
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:13,710
tangible units so I see it being much

953
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,890
like the American Kennel Club model

954
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,809
where you have a group of individuals

955
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:20,909
that have been breeding dogs for a long

956
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,980
time and you have consensus about what

957
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:25,079
is a terrier type you know if you're

958
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,539
going to come to them at a Casey and say

959
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,759
I'm bred a new breed of dog you have

960
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:32,579
that entire group that you have to then

961
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,000
interact with and justify why this

962
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:39,299
particular group of crosses and your

963
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,460
dogs justifies becoming a new breed and

964
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,380
so in the same thing in the plant world

965
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,079
you know if you have someone coming a

966
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:49,769
thing this is you know the original haze

967
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,230
and it just doesn't match up with the

968
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:54,360
other ten you know accessions of haze

969
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:59,340
then you start looking at your you know

970
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:02,010
we have partners that do the historical

971
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:04,769
aspect like the 420 archive is a partner

972
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:07,290
for us or a collaborator where then you

973
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:09,210
know the historical context news stories

974
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:12,150
and the history of those plants come in

975
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:15,380
to really help parse out what's real and

976
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:16,639
what's not real it's not easy and it

977
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,250
in a straightforward answer to that

978
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,960
question no I really liked I really

979
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,309
liked that answer I thought I thought

980
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,159
you really captured it and I think that

981
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:26,839
the dog-breeding example really sort of

982
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:28,278
solidified in my head exactly what

983
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:31,429
you're describing there with a new breed

984
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:34,639
or a new cultivar so it sounds like

985
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:36,889
everyone who has a plant that they think

986
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,118
it's special or that has unique origins

987
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:41,210
they really should be reaching out to

988
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,710
you to contact you yeah which I want to

989
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,420
I want to give you that have you give

990
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,970
out that information but before I do I

991
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,680
didn't want to forget one question I had

992
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:50,239
is you keep mentioning the word voucher

993
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:55,460
can you talk a little bit about what a

994
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:58,699
voucher exactly entails yes a voucher is

995
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:01,639
like the gold standard of the type and

996
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:04,960
so if I've made a new new cultivar that

997
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:07,879
that voucher is the collection of those

998
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,170
vegetative pressing in the early

999
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,119
flowering pressings in concert with in

1000
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,400
any of that additional information that

1001
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:19,220
goes along to describe that that flower

1002
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,470
that entire packet or that entire unit

1003
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:25,308
would be considered the voucher of that

1004
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:28,929
pays or of that 10 dog or you know of

1005
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:31,490
that cherry pie number 10 whatever it is

1006
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:33,858
so the voucher is just that gold

1007
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:38,508
standard thing that once we've come to a

1008
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:40,338
consensus this is the plant that worked

1009
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:44,088
you know the name and the plant have

1010
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:45,949
become solidified that voucher is the

1011
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:48,170
sort of gold standard by which we can

1012
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:51,618
compare other things to it to see are

1013
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:54,528
there are they not that thing so you're

1014
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:56,480
keeping the physical you're taking one

1015
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:58,400
sample pressing that and that's the

1016
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,318
physical sample that stays with the

1017
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,108
herbarium but then I assume you're

1018
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:04,909
creating a sort of a replication I'm

1019
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:08,058
picturing like a color piece of paper

1020
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:09,139
like a color printed version of this

1021
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:12,410
that then would be considered the

1022
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:15,078
voucher is that right so the the voucher

1023
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:17,509
is actually the physical plant and then

1024
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,450
those are digitized and they're

1025
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:22,579
beautiful I mean it's just amazed I'm

1026
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:24,679
eeen they're gorgeous the physical

1027
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,539
pressings of these plants if you weren't

1028
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:28,250
in love with cannabis already this will

1029
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,120
make you just love them even more

1030
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,210
because

1031
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,099
you know their art and that's that

1032
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,039
physical pressing that becomes digitized

1033
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:39,110
and then the voucher of Hays would then

1034
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:42,079
be that gold standard and then let's say

1035
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:43,730
that I'm growing in an indoor grow in

1036
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,429
Southern California and you're growing

1037
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:50,000
outdoors and humble we could then each

1038
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:52,489
donate to the herbarium field accession

1039
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,929
so a version of the plant grown in the

1040
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,309
field so I'm not saying I'm the original

1041
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:57,769
breeder I'm just saying I know I'm

1042
00:44:55,309 --> 00:45:00,139
growing this plant and I'm growing it in

1043
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:01,849
this environment and then you add to the

1044
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:03,859
panel of information that really

1045
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:06,409
surrounds that G by E like how do those

1046
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:09,140
plants interact with their environment

1047
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:11,299
to have that flexible phenotype that we

1048
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,909
see so often in cannabis so then that

1049
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:16,550
would be the the field level the field

1050
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:19,399
accession and then all of those also

1051
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:21,200
become digitized to become a resource

1052
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,960
for the community that is contributing

1053
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:26,659
to the project so if someone wanted to

1054
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,269
get a voucher of Khem dog for example

1055
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:32,089
from the herbarium down the road that

1056
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:34,400
would be a digital copy that they would

1057
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:37,220
be receiving it's not a physical thing

1058
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,400
that you have to keep this tissue yeah

1059
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:42,559
so so what you would do is you the the

1060
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,809
voucher itself lives in the herbarium

1061
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,059
and if you have reasons and because that

1062
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:49,190
ear material then you would use the

1063
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:50,929
voucher as the reference point but you

1064
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,570
wouldn't actually get the voucher you

1065
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:55,460
know you'd be using it as your reference

1066
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:57,140
point much like you would for in this

1067
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,909
science I'm like if I'm going to the

1068
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:00,829
Smithsonian looking for those echinacea

1069
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:03,049
vouchers because I want to do a project

1070
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:05,059
with met in this space of

1071
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:08,539
differentiation in you know how Kenisha

1072
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:09,980
across you know the Prairie I'm not

1073
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:11,630
they're not going to physically give me

1074
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:15,500
those samples they may give me what I

1075
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:17,119
need whether it's a reference point to

1076
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,139
go back to or if I'm doing chemistry

1077
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,849
they can give me some chemistry

1078
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:21,889
profiling or if it's genetics they can

1079
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:24,469
give me some genetic profiling so that I

1080
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:26,420
can make sure that I'm looking at what I

1081
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:29,149
think I'm looking at and based on that

1082
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,889
voucher that they're holding about

1083
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:34,400
yourself lives in the herbarium and is

1084
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:37,519
digitized so all of this data once you

1085
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,750
have collected sufficient amount is this

1086
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:40,429
something that's going to be published

1087
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,429
online or is going to be publicly

1088
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:45,788
available down the road

1089
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:48,639
and no it will not be publicly available

1090
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:51,309
at the moment it is a hundred percent

1091
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:54,909
for the community itself so if you are a

1092
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:56,859
contributing member of the herbarium you

1093
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:59,649
have access to the resources of the

1094
00:46:56,858 --> 00:47:03,038
herbarium and that's really important

1095
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:05,980
it's it's not for us to you know sell to

1096
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,510
any other outside group that's not the

1097
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,150
point the point here is to really make

1098
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,250
definitions for and about and by the

1099
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,318
community such that they can own their

1100
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,880
material and they can leverage the

1101
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,460
information that they're collectively

1102
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,760
gathering through the repository their

1103
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,858
burial itself okay so if i donate

1104
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,380
material would i have access then

1105
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:28,778
specifically to just my material or

1106
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,940
would i have access to other material in

1107
00:47:28,778 --> 00:47:35,980
there a barium that relates to my

1108
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:38,650
donation yes so you if you are giving a

1109
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,900
voucher of a particular type then you

1110
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,250
have access to the voucher set like all

1111
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,170
of the vouchers that are in the

1112
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:47,980
herbarium if you are giving here a

1113
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:50,349
farmer and Mendo and you're growing in

1114
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,028
that area and you are contributing field

1115
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:53,380
accession like these are the plants I'm

1116
00:47:52,028 --> 00:47:56,380
growing and I'm gonna give you these

1117
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:59,619
accessions in my fields then you have

1118
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,920
access to the Mendocino herbarium to

1119
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:04,088
really understand how those plants are

1120
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,769
expressing themselves within your area

1121
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:08,650
so that you can utilize the resource

1122
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:10,869
that you are contributing to okay so

1123
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,400
this really is a community resource in a

1124
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:14,440
sense even though it's not a public

1125
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,079
resource I just I want to clarify that

1126
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,139
because yeah if people are giving you

1127
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:23,710
essentially this you know these genetics

1128
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:25,269
or this this data just finding out sort

1129
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,818
of what the long-term goals for that

1130
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:29,318
data is and the mission of your you know

1131
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:32,079
of your nonprofit I think is really

1132
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:34,389
important yeah the mission is really to

1133
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,589
help the community to find their own

1134
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:40,239
cultivars that they have the power to

1135
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:44,170
not only maintain access to those

1136
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:46,328
cultivars but you know own those plants

1137
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:49,659
and the names and the history of those

1138
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:52,839
plants any other you know all of our

1139
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:54,489
partnerships that would surround you

1140
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:56,659
know chemistry partnerships of genetic

1141
00:48:54,489 --> 00:49:00,779
partnerships would really be all

1142
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:03,239
done in alignment of defining cultivar

1143
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:08,100
types so that those individuals donating

1144
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:10,500
those types have ownership of those

1145
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:13,380
types so there's no there's no in the

1146
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,869
herbarium is not is not set up to do any

1147
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,269
you know we don't have the financial

1148
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:20,460
prowess to you know genotype all these

1149
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:22,050
things or chemically analyze all these

1150
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,059
things all of those bits of information

1151
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:27,210
would come from the breeders and the

1152
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:30,269
cultivators themselves submitting that

1153
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:32,760
information to support the cult of our

1154
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:34,320
definitions that they're defining so

1155
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,760
essentially what you're saying is

1156
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,070
they're not you're not giving up any

1157
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,260
ownership of your plant by sharing this

1158
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:42,120
and creating a voucher but what you are

1159
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:46,320
doing is sort of adding to the richness

1160
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:47,549
and history of this plant and preserving

1161
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,240
essentially doing the opposite

1162
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:54,269
essentially preserving your your

1163
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:56,039
property and/or your you know what the

1164
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:59,730
work that you've done in this greater

1165
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:01,559
you know semi public forum or collect

1166
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,139
yes and you're actually yeah you're

1167
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:06,380
actually increasing your legitimacy of

1168
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:09,059
ownership because you have a third-party

1169
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,670
herbarium that's holding the material

1170
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:15,029
that actually defines your type and so

1171
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:17,220
it's actually a very effective way to

1172
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,730
create precedent and ownership precedent

1173
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:23,339
that is linked to you as the owner of

1174
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,500
that material so if anything it actually

1175
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:29,430
contributes to the lineage of ownership

1176
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,989
by contributing you know it's it's

1177
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:32,549
that's a stake in the sand you know I've

1178
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:34,739
had this plant and this is the plant

1179
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:37,710
then and this is how it's fine and it's

1180
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:41,250
mine like the the passing of that

1181
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:43,710
ownership is not is not anything but

1182
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,250
solidified like it's only solidified for

1183
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,690
that individual by making a contribution

1184
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:51,840
well this sounds wonderful it sounds

1185
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:53,929
like something everyone should do how do

1186
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:59,700
people do this though if they're not

1187
00:50:53,929 --> 00:51:02,969
located near you yeah you know how do we

1188
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:05,069
deal with state lines and and other

1189
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:08,069
challenges like that around around

1190
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:10,380
getting into their barium well this is

1191
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:12,059
real grass roots so we you

1192
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,210
we got herbarium scattered everywhere

1193
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:17,789
we've got a very mean New England we

1194
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:19,440
have many across the state of California

1195
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:21,119
we got some talks of people who are

1196
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,059
relate to house or variables up in

1197
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,009
Oregon and Washington and so the state

1198
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:28,049
line issue will become hopefully knock

1199
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:31,400
on wood less of a problem as we marched

1200
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:34,500
forward into sanity with our government

1201
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:37,230
but as it is now the vouchering process

1202
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,480
is happening everywhere and local or

1203
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,969
barians are working to house that

1204
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,820
material so that the entirety of the

1205
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:46,739
community can really reach in and dig

1206
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,830
into this resource and utilize it as a

1207
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:51,509
collective so right now we're running

1208
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:52,949
around to a lot of different places or

1209
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,240
having press parties and different

1210
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:56,309
things where people can come together

1211
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:59,969
and start vouchering their plants in a

1212
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:02,519
very social environment we have a lot of

1213
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:03,989
farm meetings set up and we're touring

1214
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:07,019
around in particular in Northern

1215
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:08,969
California and the the northwest at the

1216
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:12,000
moment and so it's really contacting us

1217
00:52:08,969 --> 00:52:15,539
and figuring out when we'll be in your

1218
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,780
area and how we can connect because you

1219
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:21,570
know state lines are really fake in the

1220
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:24,720
trade of a plant so giving everyone

1221
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:28,350
access as much as we possibly can right

1222
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:30,569
now is a huge priority great so I'm

1223
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:31,980
gonna post links and information on the

1224
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,480
podcast page but can you go ahead and

1225
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,550
just tell people where to find you and

1226
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,070
how if I'm a grower how I can go about

1227
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:42,830
getting getting my plants into their

1228
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:48,390
Berrien absolutely our website is Kander

1229
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:51,599
org CA nn dor org and our Instagram

1230
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:53,789
handle is just candor herbarium and

1231
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,589
either way Instagram is a really great

1232
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:57,539
way to get a hold of us and we announce

1233
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:00,150
a lot of our travels and where we're

1234
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:03,539
going to be on the Instagram but both of

1235
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:05,849
those media outlets are quick and easy

1236
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:06,840
ways to get ahold of us great well

1237
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,639
thanks for your time today and for

1238
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,860
explaining a little more about this it

1239
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,329
sounds like a wonderful program what you

1240
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,910
guys are doing so thank you for your

1241
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:17,579
work does there anything else you wanted

1242
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:20,129
to share with podcast listeners before

1243
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:22,279
signing off oh my goodness it's just

1244
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,240
been so fun to talk about this it's

1245
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,240
that's a lovely

1246
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:30,629
to be able to talk about science and the

1247
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:32,909
fun kind of cool aspects of what's going

1248
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,380
on in the scientific community and how

1249
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:37,679
it intersects with all this wonderful

1250
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:40,200
history and just love of plants so it's

1251
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,480
super exciting so thanks for taking the

1252
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:45,659
time to listen to what we're doing and

1253
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:49,588
yeah motivating us to continue on with

1254
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:51,149
the work hey guys so the end of this

1255
00:53:49,588 --> 00:53:53,279
podcast is a little different than

1256
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:54,599
normal after signing off I continued to

1257
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,210
chat with Eleanor and learn more about

1258
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:59,430
candor and herbariums I thought what she

1259
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:01,108
shared off air was valuable and really

1260
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:03,088
solidified my understandings so I'm

1261
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:05,369
including it as bonus material at the

1262
00:54:03,088 --> 00:54:08,549
end of this podcast yeah I'm interested

1263
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:11,970
to see you know how much it's so hard to

1264
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:13,560
get momentum around anything you know

1265
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:14,730
like I'm thinking about certifications

1266
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,500
like trying to get an organic

1267
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,730
certification for cannabis has been such

1268
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,530
a challenge and I kind of see this

1269
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:22,710
falling into the same category there if

1270
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:24,839
just if you can get enough people around

1271
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,699
to create enough momentum to hit that

1272
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:29,039
tipping point then it could be it could

1273
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:32,759
really be this amazing thing not that

1274
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,588
it's not amazing already but no no the

1275
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,510
snowball needs to get bigger to roll

1276
00:54:34,588 --> 00:54:38,460
down by itself right like that's

1277
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:40,440
definitely true and that's why it's it's

1278
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,510
just been such a lovely time in this

1279
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,220
last year too we've really been

1280
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:45,599
connecting with a lot of those you know

1281
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:47,069
the breeders that are really selling a

1282
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,470
lot of the proper tools in the market

1283
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:51,420
it's just a really good entry point in

1284
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:53,309
doing that because those are the places

1285
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,510
where farmers are getting their material

1286
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:56,099
if they're not generating their own

1287
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:58,800
material and so that's a really good

1288
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:02,660
layer to start with and then from that

1289
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:06,180
you get a lot of the more home town home

1290
00:55:02,659 --> 00:55:08,219
home cultivated material starting to

1291
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:09,899
come and people start and get interested

1292
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:11,939
in realizing oh what I have is unique

1293
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,760
and different and you know we had this

1294
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:18,750
Renaissance in the you know Victorian

1295
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,700
era with breeding of roses you know it's

1296
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,920
not much different it's really the same

1297
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:26,250
and it's really just harnessing the love

1298
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,460
of that plant as a community and then

1299
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:31,320
moving that forward so do you think

1300
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,539
potentially we're setting ourselves up

1301
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,519
though down the road for at least maybe

1302
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:38,130
not so much me but maybe with you with

1303
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:41,369
like a big legal fight with

1304
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:43,380
to growers or even a corporation's

1305
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:44,880
getting involved just because this

1306
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,769
industry is worth so much money

1307
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,430
this isn't podcast stuff by the way I'm

1308
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:52,559
just curious like it's almost and less

1309
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:54,389
or unless you're genetically modifying a

1310
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,340
plant it's almost impossible to get

1311
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:58,170
plant pests because you can't patent

1312
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,600
life and I think most of us agree with

1313
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:02,519
that statement you know we don't want to

1314
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:06,539
patent plants in general like that's

1315
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:08,670
ludicrous and so but we have plants like

1316
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:10,710
for example I so I have an edible

1317
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,360
nursery we had a plant that came on the

1318
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,579
market a few years ago called raspberry

1319
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,900
shortcake and Monrovia was the one

1320
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,829
selling it it was part of this brazzle

1321
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:22,230
berry series and it's this thornless

1322
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:24,449
container raspberry did self-fertile is

1323
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:26,280
awesome plant and yeah you're not

1324
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:28,889
allowed to propagate that plant legally

1325
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,540
I mean in theory I could but legally

1326
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:33,179
you're not allowed to do that they own

1327
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:35,730
the rights to that plant how does that

1328
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:37,949
happen or like because that's a varietal

1329
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:39,240
patent so they have a varietal patent on

1330
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:41,279
that plant and that's because the

1331
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:42,929
thornless trait so this is a great

1332
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,220
example of that it's the same plant as

1333
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:45,869
the next-door neighbor it just got a

1334
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:47,759
mutation it's and no longer producing

1335
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:49,710
stores but everywhere else in the genome

1336
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,470
it's probably exactly the same as the

1337
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:54,119
mother plant and so because of that

1338
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:56,039
because it's unique and different enough

1339
00:56:54,119 --> 00:57:00,960
you can get a varietal patent but a

1340
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:02,820
varietal patents a lot like a what is it

1341
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,220
like a pharmaceutical patent they're

1342
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:07,320
only for a certain amount of time and it

1343
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:11,549
doesn't say that I can't grow that plan

1344
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:13,620
it just says I can't sell propagule okay

1345
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,730
so I could in theory propagate I just

1346
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:18,389
can't make money off of that

1347
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:20,909
exactly and that's because it has a

1348
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:24,089
varietal patent associated with it and

1349
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:25,859
so that's a lot like all of the you know

1350
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:29,970
there's a really great example of like

1351
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:31,230
blushing beauty pretensions we just what

1352
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:35,039
ISM in English there's like base

1353
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:36,780
hydrangeas so blessing Beauty hydrangea

1354
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:38,639
it doesn't matter how much acid you put

1355
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,430
on the soil you know hydrangeas turn

1356
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,900
blue if they're in acidic soil this one

1357
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:44,730
there's something wrong with a gene that

1358
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,250
makes it blue so doesn't matter how

1359
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:50,400
acidic your so your soil is that

1360
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:51,929
hydrangea will always be pink and so

1361
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,400
they have a varietal patent

1362
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:55,589
it's called blushing beauty and like

1363
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,220
loath has an exclusive right to sell the

1364
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:01,789
plant okay and you know that is I think

1365
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:05,429
their 15-year patent salt like 15 years

1366
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:07,019
protections and they're not patents and

1367
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:09,239
like on the plant

1368
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:11,309
it's a varietal pest it's the name

1369
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:13,109
associated with the type associated with

1370
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:17,519
the ability to sell the profit you'll

1371
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:20,280
huh so how do we end up with seed stock

1372
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,960
then I I get what you're saying but I'm

1373
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,920
wondering too like you know every year I

1374
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:28,139
go out and buy Sakura red tomatoes or

1375
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:32,579
you know whatever a variety of tomato

1376
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:36,629
seed that is someone's making royalty on

1377
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:39,690
that who created that original yeah they

1378
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:41,070
have a it's a varietal patents and I

1379
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,200
think it's like kind of a semantics

1380
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:45,390
thing but it's not because a patent on a

1381
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:48,329
plate you can get a patent on a plant

1382
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:51,719
such that no one can do anything with

1383
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:53,069
that plant is it the GMO plants but if

1384
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:54,779
it's a variety like either

1385
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:58,289
naturally-occurring are based on

1386
00:58:54,780 --> 00:59:00,720
selection that patent bets like perky

1387
00:58:58,289 --> 00:59:03,869
and all the seeds like Silver Queen corn

1388
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:06,209
and all of the stuff the reason why they

1389
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:09,150
have a Riedel patents well they have a

1390
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:11,429
Riedel patent and so you can only buy

1391
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:14,300
the seeds from them but those only are

1392
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:18,299
certain breath of time for which those

1393
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:19,860
varietal patents are valid and then

1394
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,019
after that they're kind of like eminent

1395
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,610
in the genetic germ plasm of the

1396
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:26,039
community and you can't have ownership

1397
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:29,190
anymore and it also doesn't mean that i

1398
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:30,869
can't breed with that thing and change

1399
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:34,500
it and make it different it just means i

1400
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:35,969
can't sell that particular tomato oh but

1401
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,150
if i took it and bred it with another

1402
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:40,889
tomato dave the original person wouldn't

1403
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:43,829
have ownership over it it would be

1404
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:45,269
different right oh I just want kids like

1405
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:47,460
when I was at the Emerald Cup this year

1406
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:50,400
there was a huge line for one particular

1407
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:53,610
breeder seeds and he was making a

1408
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,559
killing on selling the seeds but then I

1409
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:57,390
was I got me wondering like if he has a

1410
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:59,820
plant that's considered so valuable to

1411
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:01,469
this community that they're willing to

1412
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,610
wait in line for five hours just for the

1413
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:03,949
seeds because it's the latest and the

1414
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:05,730
greatest

1415
01:00:03,949 --> 01:00:07,469
what other

1416
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:09,869
does that plant have them what is he

1417
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:12,480
giving up by you know selling a Caesar

1418
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:13,829
essentially sharing these genetics and

1419
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,230
that's kind of what got me thinking

1420
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:18,029
about all this yeah and I mean and then

1421
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,829
there's a coke bottle right where you

1422
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,660
don't ever give up that recipe or you

1423
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:23,250
never give that clone out you grow it in

1424
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,839
house and you only saw the product

1425
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,400
because you don't have and you held it

1426
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,250
as a trade secret that's actually the

1427
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,730
way to hold IP more tightly than any

1428
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:33,989
other way mm-hmm it's just not to let it

1429
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,369
out but it's hard to get traction

1430
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:37,979
because you've got to be able to make a

1431
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:41,250
market and supply the market without

1432
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:43,710
letting it out yeah yeah and plants are

1433
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:46,170
just weird and like plant IP like my god

1434
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:48,179
please have a plant patent attorney on

1435
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:50,159
your podcast I mean that's the person to

1436
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:52,349
really ask because it is not easy or

1437
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,719
straightforward and there are different

1438
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:57,809
rules whether you are genetically

1439
01:00:54,719 --> 01:01:00,719
modifying a plant as to what you can do

1440
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:03,630
as compared to if you're just doing like

1441
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,819
normal selections from populations of

1442
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:07,050
naturally occurring plants so do you

1443
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,869
think that basically what's going to

1444
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:12,840
happen is all these legal nuances will

1445
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:15,930
come out until it actually becomes a

1446
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,940
case like an actual case and then we're

1447
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:21,239
going to see what what the law really is

1448
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,650
around this stuff I think I think that

1449
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:24,809
is definitely going to happen and I

1450
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:26,940
think that having resources like the

1451
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:29,549
Open cannabis project which is like data

1452
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:31,349
dumping and herbarium where you have

1453
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:34,109
physical repositories of plants that are

1454
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:36,299
defined well then all of a sudden their

1455
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:39,150
importance is going to really come up

1456
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:41,820
when the PPO has to say oh we didn't

1457
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:44,160
look at all of the all of the prior art

1458
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,410
that's out there nor do we understand it

1459
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,809
that's one thing that I get told

1460
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:50,549
repeatedly with patent lawyers or you

1461
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:52,920
know in conversation with us about how

1462
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:55,410
can we utilize the herbarium in our

1463
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,150
patent searches is they don't even know

1464
01:01:55,409 --> 01:02:00,029
where the resources are to know how to

1465
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:02,160
analyze that right like that's a bad

1466
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:03,990
situation to be in when the patent

1467
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:07,019
examiner's don't even know where to look

1468
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:08,699
to know how to approach the bat just

1469
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:10,829
because nothing exists currently on it

1470
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:13,589
yep it's a hole because it's a whole new

1471
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:15,630
market yeah they won't just use the

1472
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:18,030
framework from other agricultural crops

1473
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:19,200
or industries well the problem is the

1474
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,390
frameworks rather

1475
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,669
they look at the herbarium look at the

1476
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:25,949
society that is in charge of definitions

1477
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:29,490
and we don't have that oh and so you're

1478
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:31,679
trying to create that yeah got it that

1479
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:33,899
makes more sense to me sorry

1480
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,460
yeah and the community itself should be

1481
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,900
in charge right it shouldn't be all

1482
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,369
these genetic companies are saying oh

1483
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,260
we're defining groups it's like yeah but

1484
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:42,510
you're defining this is how I look at it

1485
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:45,180
they're defining groups based on going

1486
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:47,940
to the dog pound and sequencing every

1487
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:49,500
dog in the pound and it's like well

1488
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,510
that's making an assumption that all the

1489
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,159
dogs in the pound are purebred and

1490
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,109
you're making types based on those and

1491
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:56,129
that's not true

1492
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:59,338
ninety-nine percent of those dogs are

1493
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:00,990
mutts and so you're kind of confounding

1494
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:02,539
the issue by doing that and you're

1495
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:06,598
actually making a lot of false data

1496
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:10,380
which is not helpful to anyone so with

1497
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:13,079
enough samples and enough vouchers we'll

1498
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:16,108
have the community we'll have a concept

1499
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,849
for what the actual genetic lines look

1500
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:21,210
like and what what you're like

1501
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:23,240
essentially what a purebred plant or our

1502
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:25,769
dog would look like in your example

1503
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:28,019
absolutely and then if we have arguments

1504
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:30,420
about it you have reference materials to

1505
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:34,469
go back to to actually answer questions

1506
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:39,269
based on data as opposed to hand waving

1507
01:03:34,469 --> 01:03:42,179
and you know non data huh okay that

1508
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:43,679
makes so much about Hays all of a sudden

1509
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:46,019
you can say okay these are a thousand

1510
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:48,088
hanging examples that we have out of

1511
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:51,119
these thousand these hundred come from

1512
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:53,369
vetted sources or these hundred are

1513
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,980
corroborated based on more than one one

1514
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:59,010
line of evidence and then you can you

1515
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:01,789
know you can tear data you can structure

1516
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:03,900
questions to answer them correctly you

1517
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:06,029
can't do that without a resource you

1518
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:10,250
can't you can't do good science without

1519
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:12,810
tool that's another tool to do that

1520
