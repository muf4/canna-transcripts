it hi Ted thank you yeah so I wanted to

47
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,118
start off talking a little bit about

48
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,599
your background you've shared a little

49
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,319
bit off air with me about uh how you got

50
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,118
into horiculture and teaching can you

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,519
share a little of that uh with our

52
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,799
audience sure I'd love to I I have kind

53
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,560
of a an odd background in that I was

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,560
interested in plans from age five and I

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,719
I always wanted to work with plants I

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,840
mowed lawns I worked in green houses I

57
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,439
worked in nurseries even as a kid um

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,080
when it came time to go to college of

59
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,759
course I wanted to go to plant science I

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,120
wanted to be in horiculture so I went to

61
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,959
the University of New Hampshire and I

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
was majoring in plant science and I was

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,680
just loving it except I felt like I was

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,439
getting only science only science I was

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,360
I I even asked my botney instructor

66
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,000
could you relate this to a

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,040
plant and she was insulted she's like

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,719
excuse me and and I just thought wow and

69
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:50,400
then the problem came up when I when the

70
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,560
plant science instructor intro said that

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,120
we must put a 51010 fertilizer in a

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,158
compost pile and I raised my hand and I

73
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,080
said is this really necessary in an

74
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:00,479
organic situation and he basically

75
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,800
pulled me in his office office after

76
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,479
school and said there's no place in the

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,200
State University for someone like you

78
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,840
and so I I had a rough two years there

79
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,839
science-based science based science

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
based so I

81
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
quit and moved to Seattle and worked in

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,360
the industry worked in a greenhouse

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,519
nursery in Seattle and um for a couple

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,120
years had a great time but I became

85
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,879
increasingly um unhappy with the

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,680
wonderful practitioners that I was

87
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,438
working with because I kept saying well

88
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,560
why is this happening

89
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,959
why is this happening and they'd say

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,799
just do what you're told why do you have

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,680
to ask why all the time so I was now

92
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,080
frustrated that that I couldn't

93
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,680
understand the science part of it all so

94
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,719
I went back to college went to

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,480
WSU and uh uh finished my degree got a

96
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,479
dual major in education as well as uh

97
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,318
horiculture but then I student T and I

98
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,318
hated teaching I hated teaching I hated

99
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,719
the whole scene so I went to work in the

100
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,158
industry after after college and um

101
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,598
worked for a while until I heard Lake

102
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,280
Washington was going to start a Hort

103
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:09,719
program and I thought I could do that

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,719
and so I walked literally walked in

105
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,120
sight unseen there was no job posting

106
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,519
and I said I understand you're thinking

107
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,879
of starting a Hort program and I could

108
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,439
do that for you and they said really sit

109
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,719
down and then I got the job and then 40

110
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,959
years later um I just retired so the

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
interesting thing is I had the

112
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,959
opportunity to marry the science and the

113
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,519
practice which is what the college

114
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,038
wanted and for me it was a gift from

115
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,159
Heaven because I could always be

116
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:37,279
challenging people to say why is that

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,520
happening why is that happening as

118
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,959
opposed to you prune here because the

119
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,439
plant does this and so it was a very it

120
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,120
was a very great um situation for me

121
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,959
because I could always be looking at

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,759
both sides of the

123
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,000
street well so many people I know so

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
many people who have been through your

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,038
program uh locally that are now

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,360
wonderful horticulturalists and uh you

127
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,159
know you had such impact on this area

128
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
here in terms of the education that you

129
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,400
delivered um I wanted to get you on the

130
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,360
podcast to talk about some of the stuff

131
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,638
that uh I've learned from you from the

132
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,879
you know the classes I've taken from you

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,199
uh can we talk about some of these basic

134
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,079
plant Concepts and the why uh that that

135
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,120
you mentioned from a a plant physiology

136
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,519
perspective yeah that'd be great that'd

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,160
be great um what what one would you like

138
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:32,120
to start with I know you we had talked

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,479
off air about uh root hairs and plants

140
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,360
right maybe that's something we could

141
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,800
start

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,000
on that'd be that'd be a great one I

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,600
think to back up just a hair I think as

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,918
a grower as someone working with plants

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,560
every day you need to be a critical

146
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,839
thinker you need to really have be a

147
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,399
Discerning

148
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,918
practitioner

149
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,279
um trying to teach

150
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,839
yourself what is actually happening so

151
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,000
let's talk of root root hairs root hairs

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,439
are a great example because because if I

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,120
over fertilize sorry I've got on my

154
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,598
throat if I over fertilize a

155
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,199
plant then the result is I get marginal

156
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:13,598
Leaf necrosis or more dead tissue on the

157
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:17,199
margins if I overwater a plant I get

158
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:18,839
yellow leaves and so if I underwater a

159
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,478
plant then I get a lot of yellow leaves

160
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:25,519
and I even get marginal Leaf necrosis

161
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:28,560
and so here's a here's a a view of a

162
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,079
plant here's looking at a situation and

163
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,720
saying what is wrong with this plant why

164
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,478
is this happening when you when you go

165
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,800
down to the soil level when you go down

166
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:41,199
to the to the root

167
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,360
level you see you see really what's

168
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,240
going on is root hair death and root

169
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,319
hair is let's remember for your audience

170
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,720
root hairs are an extension of the root

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,000
epidermis that is one cell thick one

172
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,759
cell thick and that's where all the

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,759
moistures coming all the water is coming

174
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,960
in all the nutrients are doing their

175
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,560
anion and cation exchange and all the

176
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,560
stuff is going on I mean it's quite a

177
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,000
bit of activity and it's at the root

178
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,680
hair level not the root lit level not

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,879
the small root level it's at the

180
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,360
microscopic root hair which is one cell

181
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,720
thick and so when you over fertilize a

182
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,038
plant you have moisture coming out of

183
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,680
the cells and dehydrating and and um

184
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,279
excuse me and the cells die and those

185
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,879
root hairs dying doesn't allow the plant

186
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,399
to take up moisture the same thing that

187
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,400
happens in dehydration actually the same

188
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,959
thing that happens in overwatering

189
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,359
because you have root hair death and so

190
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:41,478
here's an example

191
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,038
of what happens when roots are damaged

192
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,839
due to overwatering underwatering over

193
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,478
fertilizing

194
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,119
um high salt content in the soil you

195
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,639
know those kinds of things uh and yet

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,959
the top growth look exactly the same and

197
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,120
so if we're a

198
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,079
practitioner we often will say well it's

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
because you overwatered the plant what

200
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,800
was going on you overwater the plant and

201
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
the plant

202
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,000
suffocated the plant doesn't suffocate

203
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,120
it's root hair death and actually

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,639
overwatering causes drought

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,918
stress just as overwatering causes

206
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,598
nutrient

207
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,279
deficiency because of root hair because

208
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:20,680
it because they can't take up nutrients

209
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,359
through the root hairs now root hairs of

210
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,800
course are rejuvenated very quickly and

211
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,598
and things can come back back pretty

212
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,759
fast but it in the meantime you're

213
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:33,158
getting yellow yellowing leaves in the

214
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,959
meantime you're getting marginal Leaf

215
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:38,120
necrosis you're just getting some weird

216
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,239
stuff that that as the Discerning

217
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,719
practitioner you have to kind of step

218
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,600
back and say okay think critically what

219
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,519
is actually happening here what's going

220
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,440
on what's the history what's what's my

221
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,360
employee doing meaning this person has a

222
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,240
tendency to

223
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,360
overwater and that may be what's

224
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,480
happening because what I find with with

225
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,159
employees or stud students is that first

226
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,680
they overwater everything and that's

227
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,240
three months and then they underwater

228
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,519
everything and that's three months until

229
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,399
they find that happy median and so

230
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,600
that's why it takes time to develop

231
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,919
people uh it takes time to to say Can

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,399
you look because if you just say water

233
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,879
Monday Wednesday

234
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,759
Friday that may not be the same all year

235
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,120
or that may not be the same in the

236
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,838
different areas of the growing room or

237
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,799
the greenhouse because you've got fans

238
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,519
in this area and you've got a a dead

239
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,519
spot in that area meaning that there's

240
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,000
no air circulation um you know our

241
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,919
structures our growing structures have

242
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,039
all kinds of

243
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,759
microclimates and that impacts water and

244
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,240
nutrient

245
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,679
absorption kind of rambling here but um

246
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
no that was great I want to go back and

247
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,838
touch on two things that you said that I

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,759
thought were really interesting one was

249
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,800
that overwatering causes drought stress

250
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,799
because it has the exact same effect on

251
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,278
root hairs and root hair root hair death

252
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,958
because that's just so um contrary to

253
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,039
your thought you think you're you know

254
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,518
like you said you're suffocating the

255
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,360
plant but actually it's a drought stress

256
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,679
issue so I think that's really

257
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,919
interesting and I want to highlight

258
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,159
that uh the second thing that you

259
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,078
touched on in in there that I think is

260
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,199
interesting is this marginal Leaf

261
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,359
necrosis that same

262
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
symptomatic uh effect that you get on

263
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,919
the leaves regardless of what the

264
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,360
condition is in you listed you know over

265
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,399
fertilization high salt under and

266
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,278
overwatering uh traditionally in the

267
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,399
industry people will immediately say oh

268
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:35,799
that's a that's a nutrient deficiency

269
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,958
and they'll look at either applying well

270
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:41,919
cmeg which is not even a a nutrient you

271
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,759
know it's two nutrients or uh nitrogen

272
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,439
those seem to be the the two main things

273
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,799
I hear a lot of times in those cases but

274
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,519
really it's it what you're saying is it

275
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,799
could be sufficient in the soil and

276
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,078
really an issue of uptake related to uh

277
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,000
root

278
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,679
hairs right that's exactly right it

279
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,039
could be root hair death and root hair

280
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,319
remember everything is going through the

281
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:08,199
root hairs and so lack of root hairs

282
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,440
damage to root hairs death of root hairs

283
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,160
will manifest itself in the above ground

284
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,279
portion as either a deficiency or a

285
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,159
wilting or a gray green color in the

286
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,919
foliage you look at the foliage and like

287
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,278
doesn't have that vibrant green that it

288
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,879
should there's an off

289
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:30,278
color and and sometimes we even get this

290
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,879
off color and we blame it on a fungus

291
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,600
when in fact the fungus is an

292
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:37,480
opportunity opportun opportunistic

293
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,159
organism that is living off of dead

294
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,399
roots and in fact it didn't kill the

295
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,278
plant or it isn't attacking the plant

296
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,679
it's attacking dead

297
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:50,480
tissue so it's it's really it's really

298
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,879
one of those things where you have to

299
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,519
kind of become a Sherlock Holmes that's

300
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,000
why I encourage people when I when I was

301
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,480
teaching them to walk in your facility

302
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,278
whether it's a greenhouse or a grow room

303
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,278
or whatever every morning morning even

304
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,559
before people come even before you get

305
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,439
your day going when you're walking

306
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,078
around with your coffee and just do a

307
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
wellness check how's everybody doing

308
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,239
how's everybody doing here let's kind of

309
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
walk around and take a look not with the

310
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,959
task of writing a list I got to get this

311
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
done or this done or that done just kind

312
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,479
of a a a a well person check you know as

313
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,199
they do in the hospital are you okay or

314
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,560
not okay do I need to be worried here

315
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:27,719
and so that that totally can help you

316
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,278
catch things early and then become a

317
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,800
teacher to your employees or to whoever

318
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,439
is working with you on take a look at

319
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,159
this because what you do is you Empower

320
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,240
people and yourself when you configure

321
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:44,159
this out early and catch it

322
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,120
early so when you see a plant or a

323
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,679
section of plants that has an issue

324
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,600
going on what's sort of your mental

325
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,958
checklist you know you've already talked

326
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,800
a little bit about watering and over

327
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,319
fertilization how do you start narrowing

328
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,159
down the variables to getting to what

329
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
the real you know the root of the

330
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,639
problem is no pun

331
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,439
intended I yeah I look at the

332
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,240
environment I start looking around and I

333
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,720
start going yeah this is my this is my

334
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
quiet Zone meaning there's no air

335
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,800
circulation in this corner that's why

336
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,800
they're not they're not drying out as

337
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,679
fast as the ones over by the fans I I

338
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,479
just start really looking at my

339
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:24,000
environment because so many of our

340
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,199
problems are

341
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,600
environmental and in a greenhouse so

342
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:30,799
many of our problems are um envir Al

343
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,159
because maybe in the winter time we're

344
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,599
not getting the air flow maybe we're not

345
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,679
doing an air circulation maybe we're

346
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,120
worrying about Heating and so therefore

347
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,359
we don't want to do an air

348
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
exchange and an air exchange causes a

349
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,519
buildup of of humidity which causes them

350
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,800
not to take up as much moisture and now

351
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,959
we're watering them the same as we were

352
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:52,599
in July when we were having more air air

353
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,159
movement or more air uh exchanges so

354
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,639
really the way you start that is you

355
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:01,439
just become very aware you develop the

356
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:03,000
six fence of walking around looking at

357
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
the facility looking at the plan and

358
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,320
saying that's funny these three are all

359
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,519
in the same corner or these are not in

360
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,480
the same Corner they're in three

361
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,759
opposite areas what's the commonality

362
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,039
here what is going on and you have to do

363
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,800
it when you're fres you can't do it at

364
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,439
five o'clock you know you have to do it

365
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,758
when you first walk in when your energy

366
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
level's High when you're not stressed

367
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,839
with with people saying what do I do

368
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,399
next or what needs to happen or what

369
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,120
needs to happen you know you kind of

370
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,679
have to take a breath walk around I used

371
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,440
to get there early just so I could walk

372
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,719
around and say how's everybody doing

373
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,600
today um that's where you start you

374
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,440
really start with a with a with a well

375
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,240
plant check and say how's it going and

376
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,639
then then you have more confidence to to

377
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,959
tell people this is what needs to happen

378
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,480
this needs to happen and hey what's

379
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,119
going on in these Corners how often when

380
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,560
do you have that timer set or when are

381
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,600
you watering by hand how often are you

382
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,198
watering these um what I'm seeing is a

383
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,720
gray greenness to the color to the plant

384
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,319
not that vibrant green and he change

385
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
your over

386
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,040
watering even though in your head you

387
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,399
know about the root hair stuff you could

388
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,838
explain them if the employee is

389
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,000
interested or if they're you know the

390
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,399
person is interested um sometimes

391
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,240
they're

392
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,879
not Yeah so basically it's it's

393
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,600
important

394
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:21,198
to gather all the information and and

395
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,639
really dive into what's what's

396
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,240
potentially going on and in my head I'm

397
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,959
thinking about the fact that I every day

398
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,839
I see people posting pictures of their

399
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,239
plants online asking

400
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,040
you know essentially that what's wrong

401
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,959
with my plant and I have a standard

402
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,240
answer of I can't diagnose plants from a

403
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,359
photo just because I don't really feel

404
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,000
you you can fully diagnose a situation

405
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,519
from a photo um and uh I I just see

406
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,480
people getting answers and jumping to

407
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,600
conclusions and making you know pretty

408
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,399
big changes in how they're maintaining

409
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,319
their plants based off of this

410
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,799
information and right essentially what

411
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:58,318
you're saying here is that there's a lot

412
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,919
more information out there that we need

413
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,399
to gather before we can really determine

414
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,639
what's really going

415
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,039
on right and one thing we we haven't

416
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,440
even discussed is the need to not only

417
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:10,000
look at the top growth but knock it out

418
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,680
of the pot knock it out of the pot look

419
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,958
at the roots smell the root mass um Feel

420
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,958
The Roots the Roots should be white and

421
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,439
should tug when you tug when you tug on

422
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,518
them they should tug back a little bit

423
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,040
or they should snap or break if they

424
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,318
break off if they slime in your hands

425
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:31,559
you've got root death H okay what that

426
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,559
root death who cares what's going on up

427
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,039
top what's going on with this root

428
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:39,198
system because that's where all of this

429
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,759
is going on and so that's where you know

430
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:44,000
the the above ground portion is kind of

431
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,639
the final here it is this is this is the

432
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,958
result of what happened in our root

433
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,159
system so you really got to start down

434
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,879
there you got to get comfortable

435
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,759
knocking stuff out of their pots without

436
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,480
disturbing The Roots You know you just

437
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,560
kind of pick it up with one hand tap it

438
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,440
with the other hand tap the pot with the

439
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,318
other hand and the the whole thing comes

440
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,240
apart and you look at it and you smell

441
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:06,159
it you feel it with your fingers you

442
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,480
look at the color um you look at the

443
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,120
side of the pot where the roots are

444
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,919
meaning if you're in a greenhouse very

445
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,239
often The Sunny Side of the plant The

446
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,559
Sunny Side of the pot has no

447
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,120
roots because they've died and they've

448
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:24,078
all migrated to the cooler side because

449
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,519
that black pot is absorbing so much heat

450
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,038
so I mean you know those are things that

451
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,440
you'll notice wow there's no roots on

452
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,759
this half of the plant they're all on

453
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,798
the North side well maybe I need to

454
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,319
shade that south side of the greenhouse

455
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:38,160
I get a lot of heat coming in there I

456
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,759
thought that was good but with that heat

457
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
and that black pot we're actually

458
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,240
damaging some of the

459
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,599
roots so those are the kind of things

460
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,279
you see when you when you um knock it

461
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,719
out of the pot and and again the root

462
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,599
hairs you know the root hairs are so

463
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,440
important those are harder to see often

464
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,599
because you know again they're one cell

465
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,679
thick they're an extension of the root

466
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,519
epidermis so that's pretty small

467
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,280
but carrying a magnifier is a good thing

468
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,759
you

469
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,079
know so talk to me about root girdling

470
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:12,200
or why it's important when we transplant

471
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:14,119
plant plants to uh break up the roots

472
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,319
and how that relates to this this root

473
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,678
hair

474
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,759
concept right and you know and my theory

475
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,840
too on uh we have a tendency to put

476
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:27,240
human emotions into plants plants don't

477
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:29,759
like this plants don't like that um

478
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,839
plants are drowning when in fact plants

479
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,480
are responding to their environment and

480
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,158
so what we're doing with with roots when

481
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,079
we're

482
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,200
transplanting is we're knocking a plant

483
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,480
out of the pot we should be scoring the

484
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,159
root ball which means cutting Roots

485
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,798
damaging Roots because remember Roots

486
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,000
have no nodes and inner nodes like a

487
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,400
stem does a stem has nodes and inner

488
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,919
nodes and you know that if you cut a

489
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,519
stem um and and you leave an in node on

490
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,919
it'll die back to the node and then the

491
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,558
node will Sprout and that's typical you

492
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,880
know above ground dealing well below

493
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,079
there's no nodes and interner nodes so

494
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,000
wherever you cut it they're going to

495
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,199
sprout wherever you cut it they're going

496
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,960
to they're going to Branch they're going

497
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,038
to send out roots um a root system once

498
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,840
established in its Position will stay in

499
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:16,839
that position meaning if you take that

500
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,599
6inch pot and you put it in a five

501
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,918
gallon container and you don't score the

502
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,719
root mass then most of the roots are

503
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,960
going to stay in that 6inch pot and

504
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,839
continue to get thicker some will

505
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,000
venture out as opposed to if we took

506
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:35,079
that 6-in pot we scored the root ball in

507
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,679
four places um and the bottom or we

508
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,000
ripped off some roots and then put it

509
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,880
into the five gallon it would suddenly

510
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,519
Branch where we broke it and they would

511
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
score and they would venture out into

512
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,960
the new

513
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,558
environment another big mistake I see is

514
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,720
that people take a 2-in plant or a

515
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:56,960
cutting and they put it in a gigantic

516
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,000
pot and very often they say well I did

517
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,960
it and really I'm not getting any top

518
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,440
growth I better be fertilizing more or I

519
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,679
better be watering more or whatever when

520
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,919
in fact the The Cutting is actually

521
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,400
filling up that pot slowly with roots

522
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,480
and you're not seeing a lot of top

523
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,640
growth so what I like to do is I like to

524
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,360
go from a cutting to maybe a four or a

525
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,600
cutting to even a six let it root let it

526
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,199
establish let it grow well let it fill

527
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,399
up that pot with soil then bump it up to

528
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,720
a five or to a large your pot but we

529
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,200
have a tendency keep in mind that when

530
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,839
you've got a cutting and you put it in

531
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,519
this gigantic

532
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:40,480
tub and you continue to water it or if

533
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,000
you water it heavily that water plants

534
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,120
thrive on that air water relationship

535
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,359
where they they get watered they take up

536
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,959
the water it dries out there's oxygen

537
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,119
they need oxygen and so the the air

538
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,840
around there remember oxygen is a part

539
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,558
of

540
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,959
respiration which means that's how

541
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,519
they're getting their plants and

542
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,880
respiration is not breathing it's

543
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:03,519
converting that sugar that the plant has

544
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,520
into energy and so um by keeping that

545
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,200
soil Mass super saturated because you've

546
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,038
got this cutting in a 20 gallon

547
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,519
container you start to get less oxygen

548
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,679
you start to get less

549
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:17,798
exchange and you start to get less

550
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:20,400
growth and slower growth and root growth

551
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,720
that is being hindered uh and hampered

552
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,600
by the by too much

553
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,360
water so man it all goes down to air

554
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,798
water relationships it all goes down to

555
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,158
root hair life

556
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:35,079
um and then hence the need to score the

557
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,559
the root ball prior to moving into a

558
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,439
larger container that was kind of a

559
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,519
long-winded answer wasn't it no that was

560
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,679
great uh can you describe what you mean

561
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,918
by scoring for people who may not be

562
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,600
familiar with that

563
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:51,200
term yep scoring is a term where you can

564
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,719
take a Hy Hy or you can take a pair of

565
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,640
shears or a knife and when you're in

566
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,200
production you don't have time to be

567
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,240
fussing with it and teasing the roots

568
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,400
and all the kind of stuff that a

569
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,558
homeowner might do and so scoring is

570
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,360
simply taking a h Hy um or a knife or a

571
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,240
pair of shears and cutting the root

572
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,399
system in maybe four places and the

573
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,558
bottom and doing it in a in a in a

574
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,720
timely fashion I you know teaching is

575
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,759
always is always uh susceptible to

576
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,679
criticism and people would say well in

577
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,278
Industry we don't have time to do this

578
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,480
you're not in touch with reality it's

579
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,880
like if you don't have time to do it

580
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,880
well then maybe uh you shouldn't be

581
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,799
doing

582
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,480
this because I really feel like you can

583
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,839
you can balance doing it well doing it

584
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,798
fast and doing it properly and so proper

585
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:44,759
scoring is really if you're if you're

586
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,519
moving right along you know you can do

587
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,000
the bottom you can do four sides you can

588
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,519
put it in a pot you don't have to worry

589
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,359
about teasing taking 10 extra minutes

590
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,079
with that one plant I don't have time

591
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,839
for this because I'm busy I know you're

592
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,278
busy so am I let's move on and so you

593
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,480
score it you move on you score it you

594
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,919
move move on you plant it so I don't

595
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,599
think it has to be I don't think we have

596
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,880
to sacrifice quality I don't think we

597
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:08,639
have to sacrifice doing it right because

598
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,080
you don't understand I'm trying to do it

599
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
fast well I'd say we have the other

600
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,119
problem with cannabis cultivation where

601
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,640
they people see this plant and they want

602
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,239
to be so cautious and careful and gentle

603
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,440
with it that they don't score the roots

604
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,519
enough you know in a lot of cases okay

605
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,400
okay but good good because I'm used to

606
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,839
dealing with industry that is like well

607
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,360
we're not being fast enough for not

608
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:34,839
being fast enough so so those who are

609
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,678
who are um scoring too too much you

610
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:38,119
don't need to take all that time you

611
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,840
just need to do it well need to do it

612
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,038
completely maybe four spots is enough

613
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,519
because remember wherever you cut it's

614
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,480
going to

615
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,639
branch and that's what's important you

616
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,000
don't have to worry about the top growth

617
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,360
where it's like well go to a node go to

618
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,798
a node you don't want to leave an in

619
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,079
node I want to do it right you know

620
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,720
that's above ground pruning this is

621
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,960
below ground prun pruning where it's

622
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,558
just like just cut it so I I see these

623
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,960
photos online of roots just wrapped over

624
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,038
and around each other you know it's

625
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,640
completely filling a pot um as the

626
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,200
people use as good examples of root

627
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,840
growth but that's not what we want from

628
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,679
a plant perspective right can you talk a

629
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,839
little bit about

630
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,559
why why root girdling is is bad or or

631
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,158
why that might not be

632
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,480
optimal you bet root girdling is is

633
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,440
basically it goes down to water

634
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,880
nutrients doesn't it root girdling is

635
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,640
basically strangling or cutting off the

636
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,159
vascular system of roots and so as these

637
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,120
remember Roots increase in girth you

638
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,559
know they they have a meristematic they

639
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,038
have a lateral meristem uh they have a

640
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:42,278
lateral layer of tissue that is growing

641
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,759
in girth and as it grows in girth and

642
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,079
you have two growing in girth they're

643
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,679
causing

644
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,960
pressure um it's like it's like staking

645
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,440
a plant above ground and as it increases

646
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,480
in girth if that twist tie or whatever

647
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,080
you've used to attach it is not loosened

648
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,319
then the stem

649
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:04,519
basically starts to become girdled or

650
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,480
strangled and it impacts water and

651
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,918
nutrient

652
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,240
flow so that's why girdling is bad

653
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,559
because it's impacting water and

654
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,079
nutrient flow and so that's why the need

655
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,519
every stage of

656
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,759
repotting is is necessary to do that

657
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,798
scoring or that cutting of roots so that

658
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,839
they can expand so they can go into

659
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:26,639
their new environment the purpose of

660
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:29,119
roots is seeking out water and nutrients

661
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:34,440
and so that anything you do to to not

662
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:40,079
help that happen is going to impact top

663
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:42,320
growth great answer thank you okay um so

664
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,599
just to highlight you brought up

665
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,480
something that we hadn't talked about

666
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:49,038
before but I I have struggled to explain

667
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,399
well when on the phone with people in

668
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:55,000
terms of of the need to transplant now

669
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,319
you mentioned not going from because a

670
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,599
lot of people want to skip that

671
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:01,119
intermediate transplant

672
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,000
um let's assume you're growing in a in a

673
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,000
bed or a large pot as your final

674
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,880
flowering container whether a tomato or

675
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,720
cannabis you know people want to go

676
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,440
straight from a 4 in into that 30 like

677
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,798
you said or from a clone into that large

678
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,600
Plant because it seems like less labor

679
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,879
can you just I I know you kind of

680
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,719
covered this but could you just

681
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,080
highlight again the reason why those

682
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,880
transplants are so critical from a from

683
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,960
a plant Health

684
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,440
perspective right right that's great and

685
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,480
I see that too and I see that that

686
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,919
really they've got to go back to

687
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,159
remembering it's all about air water

688
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:40,120
relationships in the soil and so putting

689
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:42,278
that plant into a six or a gallon uh is

690
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,079
going to let that cutting establish it's

691
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,720
going to let it fill up that pot with um

692
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:48,480
with roots you're going to be able to

693
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,720
knock it out you're going to say wow

694
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,679
nice roots and then put it into the 30

695
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,120
put it into the bed because you know

696
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,759
you're putting something that's really

697
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,119
well established what we find is we get

698
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,798
loss you have plant loss when you put a

699
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,839
cutting into a 30 and it's usually

700
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,558
because of overwatering and it's not an

701
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,398
overwatering it's just that that soil

702
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,798
Mass especially if you have an organic

703
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:12,199
matter in there that soil mass is a

704
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:14,879
sponge and it's just holding on to all

705
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,919
that moisture and not allowing that air

706
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,000
waterer relationship which is encour

707
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:23,720
encouraging the roots to grow so I think

708
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,640
it's really wise to to do that next

709
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,159
stage which is to take that cutting put

710
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,278
it into a gallon let them establish

711
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,960
then move them into the 30 I think you'd

712
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,119
be ahead um by doing that you would also

713
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,600
be able to Rogue out plants that are not

714
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,918
establishing and some plants that what

715
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,319
is wrong with it and sometimes cuting

716
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,960
just don't root well for whatever reason

717
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,918
and you thought it looked pretty good

718
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,919
but then you put it in the one gallon

719
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,120
and it

720
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,600
died well that's a lot less labor than

721
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,000
moving it to the 30 and then having it

722
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,639
die and it's like oh great now would

723
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,480
I've got these holes

724
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,640
here um so I think it's a I think it's

725
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,240
wiser to take that interim

726
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,320
step yeah and I would add that I to me

727
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,200
it seems like too when you go from uh

728
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:10,119
you know the two small of a plant in a

729
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,720
large pot uh the like you said that pot

730
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,199
may still be heavy and feel like it has

731
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,798
a lot of water but that area right

732
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,038
around in the root Zone which is a

733
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:20,918
pretty small area may be completely

734
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:22,398
dried out and it's really hard to water

735
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,559
especially when you're watering on scale

736
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,000
like let's say you had 50 or 100 of

737
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,200
these plants that you had to water I

738
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,839
think it's really hard to water them

739
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,440
effectively when they're really small

740
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,319
relative to the mass of soil that

741
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,679
they're

742
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,720
in

743
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,759
and oh go

744
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,679
ahead well I was just going to say and

745
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,319
sometimes the rooting media is a

746
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,200
different texture and structure than

747
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,798
you're planting and growing

748
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,159
media and so that that difference of

749
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,839
media often the the rooting media maybe

750
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,440
is hydrophobic it doesn't want to take

751
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,798
in moisture and yet the and yet the

752
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,679
growing mass is super saturated

753
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,038
and yet they're not Crossing they're not

754
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,038
Crossing those barriers because of the

755
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,038
repelling of the water going on from the

756
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,759
rooting media to the growing

757
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,319
media interesting phenomena well that

758
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,720
brings up another important point when

759
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,879
transplanting into the ground or into

760
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,000
different you know into a different

761
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,799
media uh one thing my dad's always

762
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,398
emphasized with me is that you it's

763
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:25,359
really important to uh mix to remove

764
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:28,558
that barrier between the two media by

765
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:31,000
mixing in uh some of the Native oil or

766
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,158
this the New Media in with the you know

767
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,720
the old that the plant is in so that uh

768
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,559
The Roots will want to reach out of

769
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,000
their

770
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:40,038
current media into the other one so you

771
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,200
kind of remove that barrier do you have

772
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:44,679
any thoughts on that oh yeah absolutely

773
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,840
and you know even when I was in college

774
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,320
we were taught you know you

775
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,639
a plant you get rid of the soil and you

776
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,759
put in good growing media into the pot

777
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,440
into this into the ground so that the

778
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,319
plant will root and establish and what

779
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,840
what science shows later is that

780
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,599
basically that's a pot inside the ground

781
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,959
and so absolutely your dad's right you

782
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:10,719
want to take and and and co-mingle the

783
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,960
two the new and the old um even in a

784
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,558
landscape you know they're they're

785
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,519
saying organic matter you know add

786
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,678
compost add compost well if you dig a

787
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,240
hole and you add a plant and then you f

788
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,399
back fill it with compost the root

789
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,120
system will stay in that nice soil

790
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,359
structure of the compost and won't

791
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,558
Venture into the native soil so yes you

792
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,119
want to mix the the new soil with the

793
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,359
old soil or the new soil with the

794
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,719
existing soil um so that the root

795
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,519
systems say oh this is the same texture

796
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,200
oh this is no problem and they go from

797
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,480
one one uh one texture into another one

798
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,600
structure into

799
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,880
another again we're putting human

800
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,240
characteristics into a plant but that's

801
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,278
just for the sake of

802
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,480
discussion sure so we've been talking

803
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:59,000
about everything sort of below ground uh

804
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,759
can we talk a little bit about what's

805
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,599
going on above ground with a plant as it

806
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,879
grows sure um

807
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:09,158
yep boy I don't know where to start here

808
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,559
I mean we could talk about plant growth

809
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:15,240
from a hormonal perspective or we could

810
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:18,678
talk about them from say a a pruning or

811
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,359
training what's going on when you

812
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:25,278
um when you when you cut a at a node or

813
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,439
you know in an inner node uh what what

814
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,000
would you want to tackle here well those

815
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,600
two are those two kind of go hand in

816
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:38,119
hand meaning why are we pruning and why

817
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:40,119
what's actually happening um so keep in

818
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:42,759
mind that the apical meristem the

819
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:46,199
growing point the terminal Bud of the

820
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:48,359
plant has hormones growing in it um and

821
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,720
or the hormones growing in it sorry

822
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:52,558
hormones are produced in that apical

823
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,600
meristem which is the growing Point

824
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,879
that's the top of the Christmas tree

825
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:59,398
right that's right it's the very tip

826
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,120
it's it's the is inside the butt of the

827
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:04,079
top of the Christmas tree you know I

828
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:06,518
mean you you take away the let's go to a

829
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,398
top of a Christmas tree it ends in these

830
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:12,319
Buds and in those buds those buds are

831
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:14,638
covered by Bud scales deep inside those

832
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,798
Bud scales is an apical

833
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:19,519
meristem okay it's it's a group of cells

834
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:20,960
that are kind of your Wonder cells and

835
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,839
they produce everything everything

836
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,519
starts there one of the things that

837
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,759
starts there is

838
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,558
hormones many hormones not all of them

839
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:33,079
but one group called oxin which is a

840
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:35,398
group of hormones and so um those oxin

841
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,240
control lateral growth and terminal

842
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:38,959
growth and those oins basically tell

843
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,759
that apical meristem we're growing up

844
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,558
we're not growing out uh let's keep

845
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,000
going and so the tip of a Christmas tree

846
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,240
keeps growing straight up the farther

847
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,159
you get away from those oxin that

848
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,278
terminal

849
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,080
Bud uh that apical meristem farther you

850
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:57,278
get away the less impact those hormones

851
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,960
have and that's why you start to get

852
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:03,200
branching below eventually you get

853
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,840
branching below that um where those oxin

854
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,440
are not impacting so by pruning by

855
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,879
removing the apical mirror stem you

856
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,480
basically remove that control that's

857
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,840
what's called apical dominance you

858
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,839
remove that control and you get

859
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:21,079
branching so when we're pruning we'll go

860
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:23,558
to a node and the node is where the bud

861
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:27,119
comes out of the stem and the inter node

862
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:29,960
is the distance between buds um you go

863
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:33,158
to a node you prune it you cut it above

864
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,919
that and what happens it branches

865
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:38,039
meaning um the bud just below where

866
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,559
you've above where you've below where

867
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:44,319
you've pruned starts to grow and the one

868
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,319
below that starts to grow and the one

869
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:50,480
below that starts to grow and those

870
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:52,439
start to to grow and get larger and they

871
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,639
in turn have an apical marem and they

872
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,840
control their own lateral

873
00:33:54,638 --> 00:34:00,519
growth and so there so therefore if you

874
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,398
want those side branches to Branch then

875
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:03,839
you tip out that apical meristem as well

876
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,879
we do that with fuches for instance

877
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,079
where we let them grow a couple nodes

878
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,679
and then we tip them and then they

879
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,239
branch and then we let those branches

880
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,358
grow a couple nodes and then we tip them

881
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,959
and then we let those branches grow a

882
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,918
couple nodes and then we tip them why

883
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,639
because we're trying to encourage

884
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:23,918
bushiness and all this pruning is

885
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,919
successful because of hormones that are

886
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,598
that are encouraging and that are um

887
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,598
inhibiting branching

888
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:37,079
so from a cannabis perspective

889
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:42,000
by removing or limiting by pinching for

890
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:45,879
example the amount of uh oxin coming out

891
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,280
of that the apical marem we allowing

892
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:52,118
other branches to grow and and getting a

893
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,280
fuller canopy uh is essentially what

894
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,800
what what you're getting at more of like

895
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,960
a I guess a

896
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,359
candelabra design versus a a Christmas

897
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,000
tree if we're going to use visuals good

898
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:06,199
choice good choice of words yep is a

899
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,838
great choice that's right right calabra

900
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,078
is right you know by pinching you

901
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,400
develop the Candelabra you develop the

902
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,760
bush by not pinching you you have a

903
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,880
Christmas tree telephone pole and it

904
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,240
will eventually Branch lower once those

905
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,079
hormones have less impact um but you get

906
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,319
a strong what's called apical dominance

907
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,079
it's the dominance of that apical Mir

908
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,760
stem to control the lateral growth

909
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,640
that's what apical bomin ances and as we

910
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,119
get this bushier plant we're getting a

911
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:39,480
lot of you know interior branching and

912
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:43,200
lower branching which may not be have

913
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:47,079
access the same access to light and air

914
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:49,639
flow uh so why what what is the

915
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,519
importance of pruning a plant and

916
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,159
removing those branches or leaves uh

917
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:57,440
from a plant Health

918
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:59,199
perspective good so so you're right

919
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,280
there's 's less light down there there's

920
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,838
less air flow down there the thing you

921
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,079
want to keep in mind is then when you

922
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:07,880
take that Branch out to the point of

923
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:10,760
origin on the stem you're not

924
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,800
encouraging any more lateral growth if

925
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,280
you just took that side choot and cut it

926
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,960
back you're encouraging more lateral

927
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,839
growth so that's an important concept

928
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,400
yeah can you explain that again so or

929
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,318
say that one more time I'm not sure that

930
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,960
I fully caught

931
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:31,079
that so you've got a plant whether it's

932
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,159
cannabis or whatever and you've got side

933
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,560
branches coming off at the bottom and

934
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,118
you're saying I want to improve the

935
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,838
quality of this plant and so I'm going

936
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,200
to reduce it by

937
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:44,960
20% because I want more light and more

938
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,759
air circulation going on so you take

939
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,559
that side branch and if you prune it

940
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,079
back to the point of origin what I mean

941
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,920
by that is back to the point where it

942
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,680
came out of the

943
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,800
stem okay if you prune it back to that

944
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,719
point then nothing's going to sprout

945
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,240
from that point say you have a leaf out

946
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,199
Leaf there that leaf is going to stay

947
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,799
there you're not going to get a new

948
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:07,679
shoot coming if you were to just tip

949
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,960
that lateral Branch it would in fact

950
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,318
Sprout lateral branches and you would

951
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,199
have more

952
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:17,119
bushiness okay so that's why I'm saying

953
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,679
on that side choot if you want to

954
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,720
improve um light those lower branches

955
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:24,039
then you're going to take it out

956
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:26,239
completely and I call it the point of

957
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:27,920
origin what we see a lot of if we're

958
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,039
talking about an indoor facility ility

959
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,599
would be uh static light coming from

960
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:39,400
above from a a light artificial light um

961
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:44,079
and so what'll happen is we'll create a

962
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:47,280
a canopy using trellis netting that's

963
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,640
essentially even and then everything

964
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,760
below a certain point is De leafed and

965
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:54,318
removed from the plant uh but for the

966
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,000
most part the branches the lateral

967
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:58,318
branches are left and and people are

968
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
just removing the the leaves cuz

969
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,838
essentially they're not

970
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,239
getting I mean the idea being they're

971
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,199
not getting enough light and air to

972
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:09,479
where they would be more of a a nutrient

973
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:14,480
sink than a you know photosynthetic

974
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:17,119
benefit right okay okay any thoughts on

975
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,159
that um not a lot except that when

976
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,318
you're growing with lights your quality

977
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,879
is often better meaning than the sun

978
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:27,960
because you often have less Shadows I

979
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,599
believe

980
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,199
um less shading so that's a really you

981
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,640
know growing strictly in lights like

982
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,838
Grow rooms and things like that I have

983
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,000
friends that that that are growing

984
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,519
cannabis and Grow rooms and and Bo the

985
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,719
light quality is so bright compared to a

986
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:47,880
greenhouse sometimes you

987
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:50,639
know yeah the actual uh the actual light

988
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,000
intensity in a greenhouse I mean

989
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,799
depending on where you are is usually

990
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,559
can be quite a lot higher but the the

991
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,160
spectrums um of of sunlight allow for

992
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,559
that in a lot of ways then we were able

993
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:04,879
to mitigate that um yeah whereas

994
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:07,639
indoors uh light spectrum's gotten so

995
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,519
much better especially since you you

996
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,838
initially started and I I don't know

997
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,759
that you had lights in your in your

998
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:14,440
Greenhouse out there in uh at Lake

999
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,599
Washington did you did you guys use

1000
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,079
stuff on we did we did but you know

1001
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,920
first of all on the prop bench we just

1002
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,280
Ed cool white fluorescent because that's

1003
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,480
what we had and and and we were in the

1004
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,240
process of doing a lot of changes and

1005
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,760
and my co-teacher that took off took

1006
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,799
over after me has done a lot of of

1007
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,240
adjusting and making you know updating

1008
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,000
and things like that with with good

1009
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,919
quality grow lights oh okay cool yeah

1010
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,199
exciting one thing I want to touch on

1011
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,039
because this was something I learned

1012
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,159
from your class that shocked me was uh

1013
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,920
looking at

1014
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:54,358
oxin um you you gave us this uh this

1015
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,720
handout I remember on oxin and light

1016
00:39:54,358 --> 00:40:00,519
and can you maybe you know where I'm

1017
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:02,399
going with this uh my my understanding

1018
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,639
was the exact opposite of what was

1019
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,960
actually going on with oxin

1020
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,159
right without without saying it myself

1021
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,639
do you want to kind of explain y what's

1022
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,000
going on there yeah so so we've all been

1023
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,118
in situations where we've put lights by

1024
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,358
windows or something and the plant bends

1025
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,240
towards light is that what you're

1026
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:21,759
thinking yeah yeah so what's actually

1027
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,879
going on inside the plant I think that's

1028
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,440
fascinating that's so funny that's right

1029
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,800
it's it's so fascinating because we

1030
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,760
always say well my plant love loves my

1031
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,280
window it bends towards the light or or

1032
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,720
even even even under grow lights you see

1033
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,599
the ones on the edges growing towards

1034
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:40,078
pointing towards the light source and so

1035
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,000
we have tendency to think the plant is

1036
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
really enjoying that and bending towards

1037
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,599
the

1038
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:48,719
Light When in fact the reality is that

1039
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,480
oxin which is a hormone is responsible

1040
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:55,199
for cell reproduction cell

1041
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:58,719
enlargement um cell development and it

1042
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:01,838
also is damaged in the Pres of light and

1043
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,719
so what happens is oxin migrate to the

1044
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:07,880
Shady Side of the plant therefore and

1045
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:10,318
causing cell cell reproduction cell

1046
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,480
enlargement causing that one side of the

1047
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,279
stem the Shady Side of the plant of the

1048
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,800
stem to actually

1049
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,000
enlarge at a faster rate than the ones

1050
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,680
on the Sunny Side therefore causing it

1051
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,639
to be nodding towards the sun because

1052
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,279
the back of its neck if I can use that

1053
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,920
analogy the back of its neck is actually

1054
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,400
growing faster than the front than the

1055
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:35,519
throat and so what do we do we turn the

1056
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,400
plant and so that the sun is so that the

1057
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:42,920
pointed part is now in a different

1058
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:45,519
direction and it evens out now in in re

1059
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,838
in nature outside plants don't have this

1060
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,400
because the sun is moving across the sky

1061
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,078
and if you've ever looked at slow motion

1062
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,440
pictures of plants they're always in a

1063
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:57,640
constant of Mo constant state of motion

1064
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,519
they're moving in a very small way and

1065
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:02,039
following that sun and hormones are

1066
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,759
actually moving around the stem in the

1067
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,318
same way so yeah it's it's it's kind of

1068
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,960
a misunderstanding that people are

1069
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,880
saying yeah my plant's bending towards

1070
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,559
the light which it is bending towards

1071
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,838
the light but for different reasons of

1072
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,599
what most most people think because the

1073
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,838
cells are elongating and growing because

1074
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,039
of ox oxin essentially on the Shady Side

1075
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,558
that's Shady Side yeah see that's a

1076
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,239
really surprised me I remember learning

1077
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,480
that and being pretty yeah pretty

1078
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:30,118
impressed by yeah it's kind of it's kind

1079
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,599
of cool yeah fun to think about that so

1080
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,119
uh I had a couple more questions I

1081
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,318
wanted to change subjects again and just

1082
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:39,358
talk a little bit more about how plants

1083
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:41,558
eat to use a human term for for plants

1084
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:46,039
again um I know you had talked a little

1085
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:48,040
bit about um root hairs already but can

1086
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:51,039
we just talk a little bit about how that

1087
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:52,719
the nutrients and water uh and a

1088
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,480
littleit about photosynthesis too sort

1089
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,399
of the the important aspects of how

1090
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,960
plants grow

1091
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,039
wow this is huge I know it's a big

1092
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,240
question yeah I don't even know where to

1093
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:06,639
start um let's skip the photosynthesis

1094
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:08,759
respiration part at this point let's

1095
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,318
just talk about nutrients and and water

1096
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,960
and what's going on at the root hair

1097
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:18,079
level it's a it's basically

1098
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,318
chemistry um goes down to I'm trying to

1099
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,640
summarize all this goes down to anions

1100
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:25,358
and cations which are positively charged

1101
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:29,118
ions and negatively charged ions and

1102
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,119
that these roots have a

1103
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,079
um homeostasis if I can use that word

1104
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,759
where where there's an electrical

1105
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,359
balance in the root hairs and so it's an

1106
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,200
active process we have a tendency to

1107
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,400
think we water the plants and they

1108
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,118
passively suck everything in and all the

1109
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,280
nutrients with it kind of like opening

1110
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:52,358
your mouth and having someone pour in a

1111
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,400
hose and you just kind of swallow

1112
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:56,000
whereas actually what they found is that

1113
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,000
it's actually much more involved and

1114
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,519
much more detailed and more scientific

1115
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,679
than that in that plants are actually

1116
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:03,800
having carrying on their own cation and

1117
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:06,679
anion

1118
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,079
exchange with the organic matter with

1119
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:12,318
the soil solution with the minerals that

1120
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,559
are in the soil and so they are giving

1121
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,318
off a cat I they are taking in a cation

1122
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,559
so they're giving off a positively

1123
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:24,039
charged ion of hydrogen and they're

1124
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:26,319
taking up a positively charged ion um of

1125
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,440
ammonium or something like that and so

1126
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,679
all these neut nutrients I mean this is

1127
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,200
like a whole quarter chemistry class

1128
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:37,960
these nutrients are in an ionic form

1129
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,480
cations and anions and the root hairs

1130
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,838
are going through their exchange process

1131
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,400
and so it's an active process and oh

1132
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,440
let's do it anyway it's an active

1133
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,639
process and this active process requires

1134
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:54,800
respiration requires energy and energy

1135
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:58,558
is achieved through respiration

1136
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,240
respiration is the is the

1137
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,319
uh transfer of the sugars that are

1138
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:05,399
created in

1139
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:08,400
photosynthesis into energy therefore

1140
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,519
using that energy in the root hair level

1141
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,318
to carry on this process of cation and

1142
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,920
anion

1143
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:19,759
exchange this this is a

1144
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:23,760
lot it is uh one of the things did any

1145
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,400
of that make sense yes yes um in in

1146
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,880
terms of that cation anion exchange you

1147
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,440
know you you mentioned like there's

1148
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,920
certain basic cations ions that we talk

1149
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,760
about with you know calcium magnesium

1150
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,599
potassium sodium and annion like uh you

1151
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,359
know I think of nitrogen and and

1152
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,640
phosphorus being the main two uh sulfur

1153
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:44,199
yes sulfur is a big one because it

1154
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,838
allows us to lower the ph and a lot of

1155
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:48,759
what that comes back to is pH and I

1156
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:51,279
don't want to spend a lot of time on ph

1157
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,680
but I I would like to mention that I

1158
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,480
think in Organics people underestimate

1159
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:58,598
the importance of pH in a lot of cases

1160
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,119
and when we talk about the plant's

1161
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:04,640
ability to uptake nutrients by

1162
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:07,160
having by having a pH in a Range that's

1163
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,960
optimal for a plant it just makes it

1164
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:13,279
easier for the plant to make these

1165
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:16,079
exchanges so it's using less energy to

1166
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:20,359
receive the nutrients that it

1167
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:24,000
needs okay okay and it also yeah yeah

1168
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:25,598
that's true and pH also impacts the form

1169
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,239
that the nutrients are

1170
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,640
in in the the ground for for instance

1171
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:33,519
plants want to take up nutrients in a

1172
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:35,279
certain form they want to take up

1173
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,318
nitrate they don't want to they won't

1174
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,960
take up

1175
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:44,000
nitrite well nitrate is NO3 nitrite is

1176
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,559
NO2 and they're both an

1177
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,039
anion and given too low of a pH too high

1178
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:52,480
of a pH these nutrients although they're

1179
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,000
present are not available to the plant

1180
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,318
because they're in a form that the plant

1181
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,358
can't take up and that's why pH which is

1182
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:01,519
one major reason why pH is so important

1183
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:05,199
because it keeps nutrients in an

1184
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,719
available form to the plant you know if

1185
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,879
you want a box of C you want to eat some

1186
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,318
cereal you have to take it out of the

1187
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,119
bag and put it into a bowl so it's in a

1188
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:15,440
form you can eat as opposed to just

1189
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,880
eating the box and the plastic and then

1190
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,000
and the um

1191
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,960
cereal I don't have a lot to add to

1192
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,199
that so it's kind of a weird weird

1193
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:30,199
analogy but just came to me yeah no so

1194
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,318
uh when we're talking about optimal

1195
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:34,159
Plant

1196
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:36,599
Nutrition um all of these things you

1197
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,920
know we're talking about root hair death

1198
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,440
and you know water and and over and

1199
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,880
underwatering and all of these things

1200
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,119
all affecting nutrient uptake and then

1201
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,119
we talk about nutrient availability from

1202
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:50,760
a a pH

1203
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,358
perspective um there's all of these

1204
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,880
things playing together so it's not a a

1205
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:56,039
simple concept when you like you

1206
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,519
mentioned when you say how plants grow

1207
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,279
or uptake new nutrients um is and we

1208
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,800
have a tendency to think that presence

1209
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,359
is the same

1210
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,760
as um availability so we do a soil test

1211
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,318
and unless we really tune into that

1212
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,520
pH

1213
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:16,480
um Well here here's a great example so

1214
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,119
people will test their soil their lawns

1215
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,760
because I deal with a lot of homeowners

1216
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,720
and they'll test it in the wintertime in

1217
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,599
the Northwest and in the winter time

1218
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:24,919
what do we have we have a lot of rain

1219
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,160
and in the winter time we have a lot of

1220
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,000
leeching and so they test their oil and

1221
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:32,799
it comes back that nitrates are zero and

1222
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,480
they go no wonder no wonder my lawn is

1223
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,839
so bad I've got to fertilize I have no

1224
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,000
nitrogen when in fact nitrates are an

1225
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,599
anion or are moving with the groundwater

1226
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,079
and therefore in the winter time you're

1227
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,240
not going to have any

1228
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,519
nitrates and you don't want to you don't

1229
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:48,759
want to apply nitrates in the winter no

1230
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,880
because it's just going to move with the

1231
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,720
groundwater whereas you have plenty of

1232
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,960
nitrates in the summer if you have

1233
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,838
organic matter and ammonium because the

1234
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,240
microorganisms are converting that

1235
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:03,239
ammonium into a nitrate and so it's so

1236
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:06,239
that's why that's why the pH needs to be

1237
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:08,318
really looked into and dealt with um

1238
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:12,159
because it's not only a nutrient present

1239
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,159
issue it's a nutrient availability

1240
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,480
issue you this is a little off topic for

1241
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,359
this podcast but I I thought this was

1242
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,838
really interesting in your class when

1243
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:25,598
you talked about fruit trees and when to

1244
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:26,960
fertilize and when to prune uh because I

1245
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,400
know a lot of people that listen to this

1246
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,358
podcast also grow food could you give

1247
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,760
that quick synopsis because this is

1248
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:38,078
something I I always forget and I I I

1249
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,559
want to keep it fresh in my head too as

1250
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,519
as something that I think is important

1251
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,000
because because of you when I look at a

1252
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,159
plant now I don't look at a Rasberry

1253
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,199
plant and just say oh I prune it you

1254
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:50,598
know right I can prune it right now I

1255
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:53,078
start thinking you know when does it

1256
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:55,798
when and how does it grow what is the

1257
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:58,000
optimal time for me to prune it and I

1258
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:59,599
think see the biggest the biggest

1259
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,679
mistakes happening with fruit

1260
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,480
trees yeah well that's great because you

1261
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:07,798
know I was doing a lot of consultation

1262
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,838
in my Heyday and I'd get a ton of

1263
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:11,838
questions from homeowners or from people

1264
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:14,480
who were saying well when do I prune

1265
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:17,639
when do I fertilize when do I this when

1266
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,639
do I that and I and I used to think man

1267
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,118
I'm getting a lot of these same

1268
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,279
questions so I started teaching in class

1269
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:25,599
think like a

1270
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,119
plant how does a plant grow what is

1271
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,880
going on at certain times of the of the

1272
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:32,358
year and

1273
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,720
so and we're often sold to bill of goods

1274
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:36,558
by fertilizer companies by chemical

1275
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:39,078
companies that are basically saying it's

1276
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,280
February time to fertilize your lawn and

1277
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,400
so let's let's talk fruit trees for

1278
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,519
instance so what's going through the the

1279
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,599
life cycle of or of a plant in the

1280
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,719
winter time it's dormant and so it

1281
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:54,559
doesn't need nutrients in the wintertime

1282
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,798
um in the spring March it's going

1283
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,599
through a grow surge so does it need

1284
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:01,239
nutrients no how's it getting this grow

1285
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,200
surge the grow surge is coming from

1286
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:06,118
stored food in the root system that it's

1287
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,159
stored last fall and so we don't need to

1288
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,240
be fertilizing in February and in March

1289
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,480
and in fact it's just going to be

1290
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:14,078
leeching away in the Northwest even

1291
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,920
though the weather is getting better um

1292
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,839
we need to resist that Temptation and so

1293
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:22,760
as a plant grows it puts out it starts

1294
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:25,358
to grow um say we've pruned it in

1295
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,119
February March it starts to grow in

1296
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:30,480
April it bloom rooms it puts on this

1297
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,599
massive amount of Chute growth it puts

1298
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,760
on flowers those flowers are fertilized

1299
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:38,838
by the bees and other pollinators and

1300
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:41,480
then it starts to develop fruit at that

1301
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:44,159
point in the Pacific Northwest at that

1302
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,679
point when that when that fruit starts

1303
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,039
to come on those leaves are fully

1304
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:51,159
expanded its food reserves are at its

1305
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,920
lowest E I mean that's the time to

1306
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:55,558
fertilize I usually tell people around

1307
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,200
here Memorial Day because Memorial Day

1308
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:00,240
the end of May that that's when plants

1309
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:02,480
are are really needing some

1310
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,479
nutrients but usually we've done it in

1311
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,639
March so Memorial Day they need those

1312
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,358
nutrients and they need to to be storing

1313
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,358
food they need to be they've already

1314
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:14,719
exhausted a ton of energy by producing

1315
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:18,239
lots of leaves they're now producing

1316
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:21,078
fruit the fruit is is taking taking um

1317
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,358
products to photosynthesis to sugars and

1318
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,798
starches and those kind of things it's

1319
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:26,199
just taking a lot of energy so like I

1320
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:28,559
grow a lot of blueberries you know so i

1321
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:30,118
f flize them in May for I fertilize them

1322
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,559
miday and mid

1323
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,559
June because I'm going to be harvesting

1324
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,160
in

1325
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:38,640
July and then as we move into fall

1326
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:42,039
what's going on what's going on in late

1327
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:45,400
summer in late summer in August

1328
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:47,838
daylength is shorter um nutrients are

1329
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:51,160
migrating from the leaves back to the

1330
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:53,639
stems so that's not the time to prune

1331
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:55,838
because you've got to again I always try

1332
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:57,480
to get people thinking like a plant

1333
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,000
think like a PL

1334
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,960
you don't want to be pruned when you're

1335
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,480
when you're trying to um take those

1336
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,720
sugars and starches and nutrients and

1337
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,679
store them into your root system then

1338
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:11,480
someone comes along and cuts off 30% of

1339
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:14,039
your foliage it's like whoa whoa whoa so

1340
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,440
and in fact we've had bad fruit years

1341
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,639
when we've had a early

1342
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,119
Frost when we've had an early hard

1343
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,879
freeze first of November when the leaves

1344
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,480
have not finished migrating sugars back

1345
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,838
that impacts our fruit production for

1346
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,358
the next year

1347
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:32,318
so so always getting people to think

1348
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:34,960
like a plant and what is actually going

1349
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:37,759
on will help you answer questions on

1350
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:41,000
when to do things when to fertilize when

1351
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,280
to prune um if you prune a plant in

1352
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,719
October and I was taught this growing up

1353
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,400
in New England you don't plant a you

1354
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:47,838
don't prune a plant in the fall because

1355
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,000
it will send out a lot of new growth

1356
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:52,400
that'll get frozen off well that's a

1357
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,480
Croc that's been shown that's not true

1358
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,318
at all the plant pruned in the fall

1359
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,639
doesn't suddenly over overcome daylength

1360
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,519
cool night

1361
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:04,480
temperatures um the migration of sugars

1362
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:06,559
back and suddenly put out a ton of New

1363
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,760
Growth it can't do that what happens

1364
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,119
actually it start it may just die or it

1365
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,720
may just die back if I want growth

1366
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,798
Resurgence when do I prune I prune right

1367
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:21,078
before growth Resurgence which would be

1368
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:23,719
February for us in the Northwest because

1369
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:26,000
right before growth Resurgence is when I

1370
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:28,279
prune and then I get this massive amount

1371
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,280
of stored food coming from the root

1372
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,839
system encouraging new branching and I

1373
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:37,640
get this explosion of growth so always

1374
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:39,239
encouraging people to think about how

1375
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:41,719
plants grow and what's actually going on

1376
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:44,078
in their natural cycles with daylength

1377
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:46,000
with night temperatures um and what

1378
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,519
impact will this have if I want to

1379
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,440
rejuvenate a plant well I'm going to put

1380
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:52,239
them in

1381
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,440
February if I want if I want a hedge to

1382
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,239
stay the height that I want it to stay

1383
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:59,519
at when am I going to prune it I'm going

1384
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:01,519
to approved it in July because in July

1385
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,880
it's already gone through its grow

1386
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:06,838
Surge and its food food reserves are at

1387
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,280
their lowest de therefore pruning that

1388
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:11,239
hedge in July it'll stay nice until next

1389
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,599
spring I had a client that said I want

1390
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:15,318
you to prune my hedge I said I can PR it

1391
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,039
now and you can pay me to PR it again in

1392
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:19,279
eight

1393
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,838
weeks why would I do that I said because

1394
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,200
if I pr it now it's going to have a grow

1395
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,920
surge well it looks Shaggy I said let's

1396
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:27,639
let it look Shaggy till July then I'll

1397
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,480
prune it and it will stay nice for

1398
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:33,480
almost a year oh well that would be a

1399
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,920
lot better so understanding how plants

1400
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,079
grow helps you to be a better

1401
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,159
practitioner and I I know that uh one of

1402
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:44,160
the things that you talked about too is

1403
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:47,639
different plants fruit differently for

1404
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:49,358
example um in terms of like raspberries

1405
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:51,400
fruiting on second-year wood can you

1406
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:56,798
touch on that quickly

1407
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,119
too sure uh different plants bear fruit

1408
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:59,199
and that's a question you ask yourself

1409
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:01,640
if you're trying to say I don't know how

1410
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:03,598
to prune this thing ask yourself on what

1411
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:06,358
wood does it produce

1412
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,920
fruit is it seconde wood is it first

1413
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,759
year wood with raspberries if it's a

1414
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,000
single crop raspberry as opposed to an

1415
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,440
Ever bearing a single crop raspberry

1416
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,358
will produce fruit on seconde wood and

1417
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,119
then the cane

1418
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:23,440
dies so you cut it down to the ground

1419
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,960
you cut that cane down to the ground

1420
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,079
because all during the summer while one

1421
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,119
one cane was bearing fruit another Cane

1422
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,599
was growing up and living its life and

1423
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,960
it will produce fruit next

1424
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,440
year and people always say well how do I

1425
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,480
know if I have ever bearing or single

1426
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,440
crop raspberries I say well you look at

1427
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:45,880
the plant and you say well here's where

1428
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:49,119
this here's where the fruit was from

1429
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:51,798
last year Well if you scratch the bark

1430
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,119
on that cane and it comes up green that

1431
00:56:51,798 --> 00:56:56,798
means that cane is still alive and that

1432
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,400
means it's an everbearing

1433
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,000
because everbearing raspberries bear

1434
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:04,200
fruit on the tip in the fall of the

1435
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,358
first year and on the midsection of that

1436
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,798
same cane the next year and then the

1437
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:11,960
cane dies with raspberries canes are

1438
00:57:09,798 --> 00:57:13,719
banial meaning they die after two years

1439
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,000
but the roots are perennial they

1440
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:18,118
continue to live we could have a whole

1441
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,119
topic on raspberries

1442
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:22,798
here I know well I so we recorded when

1443
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,798
you came out to the farm and did a

1444
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:26,480
pruning video we recorded that I still

1445
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,038
watch that periodically cuz have to

1446
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,679
refresh for myself with the plants that

1447
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,839
I have you know like think like a plant

1448
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:36,480
you know why when and why do I want to

1449
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,480
be pruning and I realize for this

1450
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,960
podcast you know a lot of people are

1451
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,838
focused on cannabis production but

1452
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,000
they're growing other plants and even

1453
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,038
with you know cannabis it's good to have

1454
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,639
an understanding of why we're pruning

1455
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:52,039
the plant the way we are and what what's

1456
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:53,400
causing the effects that we're seeing

1457
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:56,280
when we do

1458
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,519
so yep and and and I think even in this

1459
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,839
time you know of pandemic food security

1460
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:02,519
is on everybody's mind and I think the

1461
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:04,000
more we can do to produce our own food

1462
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:07,559
and part of that is understanding on

1463
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,239
what would am I going to get fruit we

1464
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:10,839
all want food security and we all want

1465
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:12,558
to be producing we all want to go out in

1466
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:14,759
our Landscapes and our Gardens no matter

1467
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,920
how big or how small they are and pick

1468
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,319
an apple and say oh this is pesticide

1469
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,240
free I know

1470
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:24,079
that and you know we can't control a lot

1471
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:26,118
but we can control what we're

1472
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,559
growing yeah and you mentioned blue

1473
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,079
blueberries and I know I had uh I had an

1474
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,280
issue growing blueberries I put a

1475
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,839
blueberry plant in the ground and it I I

1476
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:37,000
put some of the our biochar soil in with

1477
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:39,480
it and the thing just didn't grow for

1478
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,440
two years and I had to stop and think

1479
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,679
about that and then I realized well our

1480
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,559
soil tends to run a little more alkaline

1481
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:49,960
biochars alkaline I've got this

1482
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:54,920
blueberry bush growing in soil that's

1483
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:57,079
you know close to S 71 in some cases uh

1484
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,079
it's not it's not happen

1485
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,760
you know because it wants it's working

1486
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:02,400
really hard just to stay alive because

1487
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,160
the nutrient availability even though

1488
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,039
there was a ton of nutrients in that

1489
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:11,118
biochar soil it wasn't available to the

1490
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:14,400
plant wow wow what a great learning it

1491
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:16,160
likes four five to four to five five pH

1492
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,240
yeah we weren't even close I mean

1493
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,798
especially because you know it's a

1494
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:22,199
logarithmic scale just like uh the RoR

1495
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:24,599
scale with earthquakes like it's uh we

1496
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:27,279
were so far off from what that plant

1497
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:30,640
wanted um and I frankly haven't I

1498
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:34,160
haven't grown a lot of great blueberries

1499
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:37,279
um unfortunately um but I've had good

1500
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:39,279
success with raspberries and other crops

1501
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,440
um but I look forward to learning you

1502
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,839
know and think thinking about how how a

1503
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,519
plant grows and what it wants and then

1504
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:47,920
trying to structure a soil because I

1505
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:49,719
know if I go back to grow blueberries

1506
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,599
now I'm going to approach it entirely

1507
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,598
differently and really think about how

1508
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:57,079
do I create that acidic soil that uh you

1509
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:59,640
know and very like

1510
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:01,240
heavy moisture soil that that

1511
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:03,440
blueberries are going to want like what

1512
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:05,519
environment do they normally grow in you

1513
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,679
know that they grow in bogs which is

1514
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:10,960
heavily moisture but is also heavily

1515
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:13,199
oxygenated and so therefore people say

1516
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,760
around here they say my blueberries

1517
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:16,798
won't grow and and we've got an acid pH

1518
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,359
in the whole bit well it's because

1519
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,119
they're putting them in heavy clay

1520
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:22,798
blueberries don't grow grow in heavy

1521
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:26,680
clay they want they want a bog they want

1522
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:28,838
air they they want air at their roots

1523
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:31,078
that airwater relationship so it's pH

1524
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:33,480
it's airwater relationship they're a bog

1525
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:35,880
plant so what does this boil down to it

1526
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,798
it goes back to where we started which

1527
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,480
is critical thinking isn't

1528
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:45,599
it yeah I mean when you say that I think

1529
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:48,559
of moss in uh in Turf in in grass and

1530
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,039
Lawn around here you see that so much

1531
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,240
and people say how do I get rid of my

1532
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:54,280
Moss you know and they'll they'll take

1533
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:57,078
it out and put in you know new sod MOS

1534
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,599
kill yeah or MOS kill and yet it doesn't

1535
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:01,760
really solve their problem because their

1536
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:04,760
problem is compaction it's shade it's

1537
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,400
you know excessive water in that area

1538
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,480
that doesn't allow the grass to out

1539
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,880
compete the Moss you know right right

1540
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,960
and and they don't understand that Moss

1541
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,400
is not I mean you see tons of moss in

1542
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,440
full sun

1543
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,838
areas and that's because they don't

1544
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,920
understand that Moss is a function of

1545
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:24,960
poor nutrition low ph and

1546
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,838
environment well if you've got poor

1547
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,960
nutrition low ph ag even though it's in

1548
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,239
full sun you're going to have a lot of

1549
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,199
MTH yeah I mean we see moss on roof

1550
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:37,838
around here all the time obviously it's

1551
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:40,480
getting light yeah right right so it's a

1552
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:42,078
it's a yeah it's that critical thinking

1553
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,119
what what's really going on

1554
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,680
here and plants because we've grown up

1555
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:50,119
with plants because plants are

1556
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:52,399
comfortable there's a ton of room

1557
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:56,599
for home

1558
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,880
Elixir hearsay and you know plants like

1559
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,359
this and plants don't like this instead

1560
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,599
of really looking at the plant and

1561
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:06,119
saying okay what do you need you know

1562
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,359
what's going on here becoming you know

1563
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:09,519
becoming

1564
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,440
Discerning that's a really good point

1565
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:14,199
because in the Cannabis industry

1566
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,159
especially there's millions of products

1567
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:18,759
and uh you know people you'll talk to

1568
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:21,038
someone and they'll say you need you

1569
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,760
know product X in order to grow a good

1570
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,960
canvas plant I put this product on and

1571
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,799
my plants took off you know and they

1572
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,000
grew so much better so people think they

1573
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:31,519
need that product uh but with a little

1574
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,119
bit critical thinking you can think well

1575
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:38,000
that product contains high nitrogen and

1576
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:41,200
my my that person that was growing with

1577
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,358
it had a nitrogen deficiency so by

1578
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,639
adding this product and getting that

1579
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:46,960
nitrogen in there that was the

1580
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,440
underlying issue uh they were able to

1581
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,519
grow a better plant but if you have a

1582
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,920
soil that has high nitrogen and you

1583
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:55,038
apply this special product you're not

1584
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,039
actually helping your plant you could be

1585
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,680
making things worse worse and so right

1586
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:01,119
that's a great example some people put

1587
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,318
in high nitrogen because they have a lot

1588
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,880
of bark in their

1589
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:06,960
soil all the bark is break is the

1590
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,519
nitrogen is is helping the microbial

1591
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,039
activity break down the bark and that's

1592
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,358
why that's working and maybe that whole

1593
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,599
scenario is working but then you're

1594
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:15,038
right you take somebody else with a

1595
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:19,920
different soil mix and it doesn't work

1596
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:21,760
at all great great great comment so I

1597
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,000
know I could I could probably keep you

1598
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:27,920
on the phone here chatting all day but

1599
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:32,159
in the interest of uh your time uh we

1600
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:34,680
can sign off here can uh since since you

1601
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,159
established Lake Washington College uh

1602
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:38,440
can we give a little plug out for that

1603
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,558
program because uh it's such a great

1604
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,318
sure a great program can you just you

1605
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,319
know a quick two minutes on on what it

1606
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:47,239
is and and if people are interested if

1607
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:49,278
they want to take courses there great L

1608
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:52,399
Lake Washington Institute of Technology

1609
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:56,039
which is in Kirkland Washington um has a

1610
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:59,079
great horiculture program it is a i i I

1611
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:02,119
had a co- teer who who was with me for

1612
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:05,240
gosh almost 15 years is now is now

1613
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:07,240
running it it's doing very well it's a

1614
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:10,479
program that is very strong in the

1615
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:13,558
basics it's strong in science it's it's

1616
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,798
meant to give people a strong foundation

1617
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,278
so they can go into cannabis or they can

1618
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:20,480
go into nurseries or retail or wholesale

1619
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:22,599
or or growing or whatever they want to

1620
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,719
go into in this industry the field of

1621
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:27,519
horiculture is so Broad and so vast but

1622
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:30,639
people need a strong Foundation the

1623
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:33,599
basics because once you understand the

1624
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:36,358
basics then you can branch and become a

1625
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:38,559
professional uh in a certain specific

1626
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:42,078
area but it's it's really strong in

1627
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,119
providing a wide range of of topics that

1628
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,119
that would help you understand soils and

1629
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:49,039
botney and propagation and you know all

1630
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,798
those things that that you can find your

1631
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,359
Niche and and sometimes people think I

1632
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:53,519
don't even like this part of it I don't

1633
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:55,400
like that part of it that's great but

1634
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,358
then the next class you take you're like

1635
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,358
this is it these are my people and so

1636
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:03,078
we've had a lot of a lot of cannabis

1637
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:06,239
people we've had a lot of of landscape

1638
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:10,359
designers landscape um practitioners in

1639
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:14,000
the field in many ways and it's a place

1640
01:05:10,358 --> 01:05:16,759
to really develop skills and develop the

1641
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,760
eye of looking from some I think that

1642
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,640
you need to be there a year and it's a

1643
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,640
one-year program certificate or degree

1644
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:24,838
um and basically you need to be there a

1645
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:26,400
year before you even know what's going

1646
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:28,119
on in the greenhouse before even know

1647
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,480
it's they've got 12,000 square feet of

1648
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:33,400
growing space and so it's a very

1649
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,400
practical Hands-On um approach to

1650
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,400
horiculture and you know you need to be

1651
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,000
doing it for a year before you see some

1652
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,720
re repetition of oh this is what happens

1653
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,400
in October in November so anyway I could

1654
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:47,199
talk forever it's a it's a great program

1655
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,358
it's a great College it's full of really

1656
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:52,118
caring people um and it's Lake

1657
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:53,798
Washington Institute of Technology in

1658
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:56,160
kirkburn Washington thanks Dad for

1659
01:05:53,798 --> 01:05:58,440
letting me say that well I would add too

1660
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:02,118
that you recently added a Growers

1661
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:04,318
program um not specifically listed for

1662
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:06,798
cannabis Growers but targeted towards

1663
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:08,798
people that are headed towards that

1664
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,278
industry and that you've taken out a few

1665
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,798
courses that may not be as useful for

1666
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:14,599
someone that that already has their

1667
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:16,679
heart set on the canvas

1668
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:17,880
industry boy and that was a challenge

1669
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:20,558
you know that was something I did right

1670
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,599
before I left and it was a challenge

1671
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,079
because the college was worried about

1672
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:28,160
Federal funding and so our president

1673
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:30,880
said very concerned about this and so I

1674
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:34,118
had to convince her that someone taking

1675
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,920
the grower program would also be able to

1676
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:39,559
transfer that knowledge into growing of

1677
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,559
any type and so we you're right we took

1678
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:44,240
out the landscape design part we took

1679
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:46,760
out the things that that people may not

1680
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:49,558
want that are becoming cannabis Growers

1681
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:52,200
um but it's still strong in botney and

1682
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:54,880
in soils and in Pest Management um

1683
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:57,879
integrated Pest Management um using

1684
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,640
beneficial and all those things that

1685
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,400
that are helpful for a cannabis grower

1686
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:03,639
but we've taken out the the design part

1687
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,000
and some of the other things that are

1688
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:07,598
not as not as beneficial and the the

1689
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,039
college is behind it and the president

1690
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,760
was behind it once I first she nixed it

1691
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:13,680
and I said could we talk about this and

1692
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,880
let's she said well this is my concern

1693
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,480
and I said well let me expand your view

1694
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,960
of this program a little bit and by the

1695
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,240
time we were done she said wow I'm so

1696
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,798
glad you came and talked to me because

1697
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:27,358
she was very open to it and said this is

1698
01:07:23,798 --> 01:07:28,719
a good idea um so yeah it's a it's a

1699
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,038
pretty exciting

1700
