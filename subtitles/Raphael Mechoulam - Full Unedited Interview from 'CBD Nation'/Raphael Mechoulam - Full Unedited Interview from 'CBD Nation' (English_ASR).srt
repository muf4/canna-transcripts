1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,579
I didn't want to do it in the lab

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,460
because it just everybody has to stop

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,740
working when they're filming and I can't

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,300
afford it yeah and they and they

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,940
complain of course

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,560
is it is it why is there so much

7
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:22,140
interest well uh because there is is

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,939
being used so widely in the U.S and so

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,859
many

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,198
states have approved it and the same is

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,439
happening in Europe

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,859
so uh when something which is not well

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,299
known is being so widely used

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:39,420
people come out and start asking

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,819
questions how where what are the type of

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,079
diseases it can do what is the

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,420
scientific background what are the

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,579
side effects and so on and so forth so

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,399
quite a lot of people come around and

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,620
start asking questions can I ask you

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,379
both something do you feel like a weight

22
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:01,320
do you feel a weight and a sort of a

23
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:04,018
pressure to keep discovering things or

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,560
to live up to your discoveries in a way

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,200
I'm not sure that I

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,040
think along those Pathways we've been

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,478
doing

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,118
yeah

29
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:20,158
in the lab in Jerusalem we've been

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:23,400
working since 1964. uh Lumia Dr hanus

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:30,020
worked in the Czech State a little bit

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:34,080
later and these are two in individual

33
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:38,280
separate researchers then Lumi joineda

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,099
lab about 20 years ago and no I don't

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,618
think that we have to find new things

36
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,839
all the time that's part of

37
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,000
of what we do all the time I mean we do

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,280
things some of them succeed and some of

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
them don't sometimes we find new things

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,060
and sometimes we don't so it depends on

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,659
what we're doing you see

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,478
most people are interested in the plants

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,500
canopy dial THC in the plant and so on

44
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:09,419
this is something that we didn't Lumia

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,120
and the Czech researchers did it

46
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,238
separately

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,800
I don't know 30 40 years ago we did it

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,580
about 50 years ago

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,140
work on the plant

50
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,160
identification of the active compound

51
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:28,139
see the active compound THC was only

52
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,780
partially known when we started working

53
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,238
it the structure was unknown it couldn't

54
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,878
it it was not available for research and

55
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,340
of course that's a major problem this is

56
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:40,378
contrary to

57
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,500
uh morphine which had been isolated from

58
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:46,439
opium 150 years previously or cocaine

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,560
which had been isolated from coca leaves

60
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,739
100 years previously and of course they

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,259
had been investigated thoroughly here we

62
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,259
had a strange situation that is a plant

63
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,598
that's being widely used in various

64
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:04,199
forms marijuana Ashish

65
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,839
etc etc but the science behind it was

66
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,419
rather weak because the active compound

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,620
or compounds had never been isolated in

68
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,759
pure form and they could not be

69
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,780
investigated

70
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:19,259
so in the 60s we went first into that

71
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,620
direction isolating the THC and many

72
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:25,259
other compounds and we I re-isolated

73
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,539
cannabi dial and quite a lot of other

74
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,759
compounds quite many of them new

75
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,579
compounds that had never been isolated

76
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,919
previously we identified their

77
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,519
structures and then we started looking

78
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,039
at the metabolism the activity and so on

79
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,200
and this went for quite a long time this

80
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,919
is essentially the first stage of

81
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,560
cannabinoid research work on the plant

82
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,899
chemistry biology clinical effects and

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,719
we did some clinical trials just as well

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,120
now this is something that we did in the

85
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,878
uh

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,739
60s early 70s we did some clinical work

87
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,719
and I can tell you about it later

88
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,180
but that was the first stage one thing

89
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,580
that was not known

90
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,700
at that point how how does it work

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,099
what's the mechanism of cannabinoid work

92
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,719
and

93
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:19,699
uh

94
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:22,579
it turned out that they are receptors

95
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:26,160
proteins in the brain and in the body

96
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:29,639
that THC binds to them

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,439
and these receptors that two of them won

98
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:37,079
when activated causes the well-known

99
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:40,379
effects of marijuana the high the other

100
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,478
one does not binding of THC to that

101
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,978
particular receptor causes only

102
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,360
protective actions and no it doesn't

103
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,659
cause the high

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,580
so THC bind to both these receptors now

105
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,040
we don't have receptors in our body

106
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,740
because there is a plant out there we

107
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,379
have receptors in our body because we

108
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,019
produce compounds that activate these

109
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:09,019
receptors when needed so we went ahead

110
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:12,120
looking for these compounds at that time

111
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:15,000
a fellow who had worked on The receptors

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,560
a joint is a postdoctoral fellow and

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,779
Lumiere hanus came from the Czech State

114
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,300
as a visiting

115
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:27,119
a scientist and then he's he has been

116
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,340
here with us now for the law he came for

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,519
six months 20 years ago and he's still

118
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:37,799
here and he just retired so um uh we

119
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,779
retired I think he's he's completely an

120
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,500
entrepreneur now yeah that's something

121
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:45,299
else you see retired from the university

122
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:49,500
the university one has to retire the age

123
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,020
of 68 or something like that so um we

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,538
went ahead looking for the compounds

125
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:57,000
that our body produces that activates

126
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:59,279
these receptors so we believe I see it

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,959
as the second stage of cannabinoid

128
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,659
research the second stage meaning

129
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,758
another compounds from the plant the

130
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,180
compounds that we produce that activate

131
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:13,199
these receptors and cause a lot of

132
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:16,860
effects and indeed we worked and at that

133
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:21,180
time as I said Dr hannus had joined us

134
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,280
and Dr Devane had joined us in quite a

135
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,620
few others when this was in

136
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:30,000
collaboration with several groups abroad

137
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,180
these the compounds that we were just

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,319
covering were also tested in the UK and

139
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:40,019
tested in the U.S and we found

140
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,360
eventually two compounds that our body

141
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,379
produces chemically they are completely

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,960
different

143
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,300
from the compound that the plant

144
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,099
produces but they have the same activity

145
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,160
more or less

146
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,280
so we called one of them anandamide and

147
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,860
the other one 2ag Ananda in Sanskrit of

148
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:02,959
course you know Sanskrit I speak it

149
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:08,280
every day yes so we found that

150
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:11,698
Ananda is supreme Joy anyway we call the

151
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,638
compound the nandamide and we elucidated

152
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:18,060
its structure and synthesized it and the

153
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,538
same with the second compound 2ag and

154
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,139
these two compounds are present in the

155
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,279
body made by the body when and where

156
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,639
needed

157
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,459
and they act when and where needed for

158
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,220
example if somebody

159
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:38,879
has been injured and there is pain

160
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:42,360
the body will produce anandamide and 2ag

161
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,279
in that area in order to lower the pain

162
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,520
but they are involved in a huge number

163
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,098
of additional actions in the brain as a

164
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,500
matter of fact the researchers at NIH

165
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:56,038
National Institute of Health in the U.S

166
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,839
I had a review and they said these two

167
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,959
compounds as a matter of fact the whole

168
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:04,379
system of endocannabinoid system The

169
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,138
receptors the compounds and so on are

170
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,519
involved in essentially all human

171
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,120
diseases

172
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,459
and this is a very strong statement

173
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,899
but they are because they do several

174
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:20,038
things they regulate some of the other

175
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,439
neurotransmitters in the body and they

176
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,659
have actions of their own so they are

177
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,719
extremely important and therefore there

178
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,039
has been a huge amount of work on them

179
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,879
thousands of papers have been published

180
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:35,819
on an antibyte in 2ag and we know quite

181
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,679
a lot about their activity within the

182
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,379
body

183
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:43,739
so we see that as the second stage of

184
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:46,799
cannabinoid research showing how this

185
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,500
endogenous cannabinoid system works in

186
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,559
the mammalian body in our body and how

187
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,580
it is associated with

188
00:08:52,559 --> 00:09:00,539
everyday life mood happiness sorrow and

189
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,700
so on and with disease states is it sort

190
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:05,179
of like like a part of the immune system

191
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,480
well it is uh

192
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:12,059
uh parallel to the immune system

193
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,278
the immune system guards us against all

194
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:16,979
kinds of things happening to us without

195
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:21,600
the immune system will be dead within 24

196
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,240
hours the activation of the one of the

197
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,639
receptors it's called the CB2 receptor

198
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,639
activation of one of the receptors helps

199
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:37,559
basically activation

200
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:42,120
of the endocannabinoid system of the CB2

201
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:44,939
receptor is a apparently extremely

202
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,959
important in guarding us against all

203
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,519
kinds of

204
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,919
things that are happening in the body

205
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,259
and we want to prevent them we don't

206
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,539
know enough about it but we know quite a

207
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,720
bit and we have seen that in many

208
00:09:54,539 --> 00:10:00,778
diseases activation of CB2 is important

209
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,720
it does not completely parallel the

210
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:06,480
immune system maybe it adds to the

211
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,300
immune system and at some point we shall

212
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:14,100
know I hope much better how these two

213
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:17,579
systems work together for someone who

214
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,540
twice a week about this you seem very

215
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,540
very energetic well I have to be at my

216
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:26,759
age but I'm

217
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:30,719
but now we have moved to the third stage

218
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,519
of the cannabinoid research and there

219
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,820
are very few people interested in that

220
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,580
stage at the moment and I can tell you

221
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,560
in a few words what's going on the

222
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,660
endogenous cannabinoids we have in the

223
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,419
body

224
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:47,719
formed a not very complicated compounds

225
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:51,179
they are

226
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,120
conformed from fatty acids like oleic

227
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:56,939
acids which is present in olive oil and

228
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,440
amino acids which form the proteins in

229
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,140
the body

230
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,420
so here we have a simple relatively

231
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,720
simple compound but the body has

232
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:09,659
prepared almost 100 of these maybe more

233
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,600
of compounds of the same type fatty

234
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,519
acids Mountain amino acids and it

235
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,399
doesn't make a hundred compounds because

236
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,339
it has nothing to do it makes them

237
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,500
because of it knows how to make them and

238
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:26,880
it needs them and we have found that

239
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:30,059
these compounds about 100 of them those

240
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,799
that we have investigated are of major

241
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,039
importance in our body

242
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,240
so this is the third stage of

243
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,179
cannabinoid research we found that one

244
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,240
of the compounds acts in osteoporosis

245
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:44,819
the breaking down of Bones

246
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,860
the background of that women after the

247
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:51,920
age of 50 with all the changes are

248
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:54,980
happening in the hormone levels then

249
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,019
they should have a lot of

250
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,459
bone damage

251
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,639
osteoporosis it's not all not all women

252
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:04,319
have that and the reason is women as

253
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,259
well as men but women in this case

254
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,140
produce a compound which is closely

255
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:14,458
related to the endocannabinoids closely

256
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:16,559
related to anandamide which blocks

257
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:20,639
osteoporosis

258
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:23,299
in another field with Professor shohami

259
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,039
we found the compounds of this type

260
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:29,699
affect brain damage

261
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,860
and if somebody has brain damage the

262
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,100
brain starts producing them and lowers

263
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,440
the brain damage wait but if someone

264
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,940
with osteoporosis creates these

265
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,660
compounds then how come they still have

266
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,360
osteoporosis well uh

267
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:47,838
they do not block completely they act

268
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,399
against those operas they say the body

269
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,740
starts

270
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:56,039
breaking down the bone see

271
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,060
our bones are not stable to this in the

272
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,159
sense that

273
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,799
the same bones that you had when you

274
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:04,559
were six years old will be when you're

275
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,379
six years old and the body changes them

276
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,419
I mean brace them down and build them

277
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,958
again breaks them down and build them

278
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:15,000
again they are cells

279
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:19,338
that build the bones and cells they

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,278
break the bones so these compounds

281
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:26,160
endogenous compounds limit the action of

282
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:29,700
the cells that break the bones and

283
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:33,899
enhance the action of the cells that

284
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,820
uh buildabouts so it's a regulator in

285
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:38,458
this case the same is true for brain

286
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,800
damage we recently found something else

287
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:43,439
which is also of major importance I

288
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:47,299
believe we have to find out

289
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:51,420
our body makes one compound of that type

290
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:54,500
that tries to block certain addictions

291
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:57,539
in this case we've worked only in uh

292
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,379
nicotine addiction we found that our

293
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:04,219
body makes a compound

294
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:07,338
that tries to block nicotine addiction

295
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,680
and tries to block the

296
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,779
the effects

297
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:15,899
that are caused by addiction the effect

298
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:17,100
that caused after one stops taking an

299
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,100
addictive drug

300
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,680
now it doesn't succeed almost but

301
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,800
sometimes apparently it does succeed

302
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:28,199
most of the research and addiction has

303
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,740
been done on the addicted people or

304
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,060
addicted animals very little work has

305
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,159
been done on those that are not addicted

306
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:42,359
we have with

307
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:44,219
a different addictive drugs only partial

308
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,519
addiction

309
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,980
only depends on the drug it may be

310
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,159
twenty percent sixty percent seventy

311
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,980
percent get addicted why don't the other

312
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:59,639
get addicted why don't we have because

313
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,820
the body produces a compound and maybe

314
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,180
compounds we so far identified one

315
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,160
compound and published it

316
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:11,000
showing that it blocks nicotine

317
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,838
addiction and it can block the

318
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,320
withdrawal effects both of

319
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,940
nicotine and of opiates in animals we

320
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,600
haven't tested in that in humans that's

321
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,079
complete that's uh the next phase so if

322
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,159
we if the body does that

323
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:30,838
it's a major

324
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,958
advance

325
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,660
towards using such compounds is

326
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:38,219
anti-addictive compounds so here we are

327
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:41,219
at the third stage of cannabinoid

328
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,160
research working on compounds that are

329
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:50,180
somewhat related to the endogenous

330
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:50,179
cannabinoids but have a huge uh

331
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:57,179
effects in many many other medical

332
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,180
situations

333
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,179
um

334
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:04,620
um so if I want to ask you a few

335
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,000
things about different things do you

336
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,759
feel is if you haven't discovered THC

337
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,500
and if Lumiere hadn't discovered

338
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,240
nonetheless

339
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,919
would would someone else have discovered

340
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,259
it oh yes

341
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,838
I mean

342
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:24,120
it's nice to think that we are the only

343
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,680
Geniuses in the world but no it doesn't

344
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,339
work that way

345
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:32,519
science advances

346
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:36,180
people are happy to make an important

347
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,820
step but chances are that if we hadn't

348
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,758
done it somebody else would have done it

349
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,459
even with cannabis that's so it's it's

350
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,019
it's rare it was rare for many years for

351
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,958
anyone to study it do you think we would

352
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,919
be very far behind if you guys didn't

353
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:53,758
well we have contributed yes definitely

354
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,838
but uh

355
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,180
uh

356
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:02,459
science moves ahead it's based on

357
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:06,259
individuals but science moves ahead and

358
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:10,980
chances are that if we had not

359
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:13,318
discovered or identified the structure

360
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,360
of THC of cannaby diode somebody else

361
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,418
would have done it maybe a few days

362
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,779
later maybe

363
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:23,640
the things we did pushed the whole field

364
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:26,399
ahead but China's aside would have been

365
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,460
by done by somebody else the discovery

366
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,798
of anandamide and 2ag

367
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,980
again chances are that it could have

368
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:37,440
been discovered later as regards the

369
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,960
third stage who knows

370
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,220
the guy I can't remember his name Gill I

371
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,259
think I can't remember the guy who runs

372
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,240
Debbie mealy's lab with him told me that

373
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,579
when they first opened the lab the

374
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,679
technion was against it and they they

375
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,259
said okay we'll let you open it but they

376
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,960
were embarrassed by it or something and

377
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,179
I'm not so sure about it the they got a

378
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,679
lot of money they got millions in order

379
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,679
to set up the lamp yeah

380
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,019
they wouldn't they wouldn't come to show

381
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,120
them yeah and what what I'm getting at

382
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,700
is do you think is is there a sense of

383
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,639
is there a fear of the establishment in

384
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,058
studying not that the Hebrew University

385
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,820
as a matter of fact when I moved here

386
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:23,359
1965 they asked me to move over after I

387
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:26,879
was at the Weitzman Institute and uh

388
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:30,599
here they offered they suggested they

389
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,480
should set up a independent unit which I

390
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:37,558
did and the university never had any

391
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,919
objections to what we were doing as a

392
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:43,859
matter of fact uh

393
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,960
the professors at the University didn't

394
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:48,538
look at it it's something that well

395
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,380
maybe should not be done and the fact is

396
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:56,579
that I was well accepted personally and

397
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,880
my research was well accepted and many

398
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:01,139
years ago I was elected by the

399
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,340
professors by the Senate of the

400
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,440
university to head the University's

401
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,899
academic head of the University as

402
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Rector they thought it were working on

403
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,038
something that is

404
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,559
well objectionable they wouldn't have

405
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:18,240
done that so

406
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:21,359
it's a

407
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,380
positive sign why why did they not think

408
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,538
that you were working on something

409
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,940
objectionable it was illegal in Israel

410
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,740
just like everywhere else so why why was

411
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,759
it acceptable do you think why was it

412
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,538
okay

413
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:37,259
well uh it's illegal to use it's not

414
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:40,619
illegal to do research I mean people do

415
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,538
research on on illegal things most of

416
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:45,719
the

417
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:48,240
investigations in law have to do with uh

418
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,700
breaking the law who knows what no uh

419
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,380
there are two different things we were

420
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,779
not doing anything illegal as a matter

421
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,960
of fact our work was supported

422
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:01,139
originally not by a financially by

423
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,679
giving us without having to pay anything

424
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:07,460
and we got cannabis from the police the

425
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,960
original work was done by

426
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,480
quite a lot of cannabis that I got from

427
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,460
the police I never had any problems with

428
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,919
the Ministry of Health as a matter of

429
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,380
fact they consulted me I never had any

430
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,660
problems with the National Institute of

431
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,940
Health in the U.S as a matter of fact I

432
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,700
was given an award

433
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,179
by the National Institute of Health for

434
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,580
our work on cannabis and it's very

435
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,980
different in America well no but I got

436
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,859
the award in America no I mean for our

437
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,640
research

438
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:41,579
well

439
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,038
the laws are complicated there more

440
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:47,639
complicated than here I mean people have

441
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:50,038
to get all kinds of approvals the same

442
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,538
is here but here it's just we're a small

443
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,119
country and I have no problems getting

444
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,798
the approvals uh

445
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,000
the Ministry of Health actually

446
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:02,700
sometimes have some of my students there

447
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,940
we've never had any problems getting

448
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,919
approvals as long as we did our work

449
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,820
legally and we always did our work

450
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,520
completely legally we never had any

451
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,859
um legal problems

452
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,879
why

453
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,879
why worth studying

454
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:30,058
well we bother because it's a something

455
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,058
of importance but in a in a university

456
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:37,798
this is

457
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:42,178
a little bit strange to ask why uh

458
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:44,639
you see something exists we know that

459
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:47,400
cannabis it has been known for thousands

460
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,520
of years that cannabis has two types of

461
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,759
effects it causes what we call the high

462
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:57,058
today but it also has medicinal effects

463
00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:00,119
we should study that we should know why

464
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:02,759
cannabis does that are there different

465
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,339
compounds that cause the recreational

466
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,319
effect versus the medicinal effect we

467
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:10,099
should learn about all kinds of things

468
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:14,879
academics

469
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:17,418
try to work on things that are in there

470
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,419
are is important not necessarily

471
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:24,440
important to the community in general

472
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:28,320
they have to decide and sometimes

473
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,380
it turns out that academics find things

474
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:34,139
that later on turn out to be of major

475
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,720
importance I can give you numerous

476
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,020
examples of that

477
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,240
breaking the atom who cared about

478
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:44,700
the atom being broken down it's a nice

479
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,519
thing well it did matter because it it

480
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,679
is the basis of

481
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,599
atomic energy and unfortunately atomic

482
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,019
bombs and so on there are many other

483
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:58,019
things who cares about a certain place

484
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:02,519
in the brain who cares well we do care

485
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:04,319
so we try I mean individually we're not

486
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,839
told from above that's the major

487
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,558
difference uh

488
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:13,439
academic a professor at the University

489
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:16,079
decides on his own what he wants to do

490
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,019
research on he's not being told from the

491
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,939
top do research on this one he has to

492
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,900
decide on his own and this is the best

493
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:27,840
way of doing it and this is why

494
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,360
universities in the West in Europe in

495
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,899
the U.S obviously in England Germany

496
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:37,019
France and so on uh has has advanced

497
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,500
much more than in many other countries

498
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:43,200
because they're the individual decides

499
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:47,419
what he has to do not somebody who is on

500
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,419
the Trap and decides for everybody else

501
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,200
working in front of a microscope do you

502
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,900
think about greater context about

503
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,179
societal context at all or or do you

504
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,460
just look for what you're looking for

505
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:03,380
well

506
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:09,000
Louis Pasteur in the 19th century said

507
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:11,520
that chance helps the prepared mind

508
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,919
so you look for something you have a

509
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,359
plan you look for something but if you

510
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,059
know

511
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,119
a little bit more you know what's going

512
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:24,178
on and you see something happening then

513
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:28,500
chances are you can explain something

514
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:31,259
new so new things happen sometimes these

515
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,759
new things are of major importance but

516
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:38,038
in most cases these new things can be

517
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:40,740
observed by people that

518
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,500
have the background to understand what's

519
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,759
happening what I mean is he meant

520
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,480
something different

521
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,480
when you're when you're doing

522
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,039
about the connection between This

523
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,200
research and just and all of society

524
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,658
using this research later or do you not

525
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,240
think that way well this is exactly what

526
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,640
I told you Society is something very

527
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,880
large I mean

528
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:10,380
a scientist is not thinking of society

529
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,780
every minute maybe in a large in a

530
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,600
in the evening when he looks at his

531
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:18,119
results as well maybe Society will be

532
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,058
interested and so on but he has a plan

533
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,058
he has to work maybe his work will

534
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,759
prevent

535
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:30,418
some kind of disease maybe the work we

536
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:34,140
are doing an addiction will prevent or

537
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:36,840
slow down Addiction in many cases in the

538
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,700
U.S last year there were that's what I

539
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,240
read 65

540
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,860
000 people died of

541
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,298
opiate addiction mostly opiate addiction

542
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:50,879
in the states well maybe by helping with

543
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:53,119
the withdrawal symptoms we can help that

544
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,820
if we can block

545
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,339
the withdrawal symptoms then many people

546
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:02,939
will be able

547
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:04,678
to get out of the other addiction at the

548
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,419
moment many of them are afraid of the

549
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,080
withdrawal symptom so they continue

550
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,240
taking the opiates in order not to get

551
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,720
with those symptoms it's a simplified

552
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,720
way of telling it but it's it has

553
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,940
something to do with it when we looked

554
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,960
at the cannabis

555
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,640
well we knew we know we knew that the

556
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,159
large number of people are using

557
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,799
cannabis maybe we can learn something

558
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,900
about it and we have learned not only

559
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,579
about the recreational effects we have

560
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,580
learned something about them medical

561
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:42,000
effects and I believe that within the

562
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:46,079
next decade or so we shall have quite a

563
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,140
few cannabinoid based drugs on the

564
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:52,859
market in in various fields

565
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:57,538
let me give you a few examples yeah uh

566
00:26:52,859 --> 00:27:00,240
we work on the and cannabi dial a major

567
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:02,158
compound found in cannabis which is not

568
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,620
psychoactive it doesn't cause the high

569
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,960
and people would have thought okay so if

570
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:12,019
it's not of major interest it is a major

571
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,019
interest because cannaby dial is a major

572
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:20,940
possible drug

573
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:24,240
we have seen that in epilepsy it blocks

574
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,759
epileptic attacks we published that 35

575
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,839
years ago

576
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:32,099
cannabidiol blocked epileptic attacks in

577
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,819
patients that nothing else was helping

578
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:34,379
them

579
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:37,339
what happened

580
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:40,320
nothing for 30 years

581
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:42,658
just the neurologists were not very

582
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,720
interested nobody was very interested

583
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:48,059
until parents found out that Canada

584
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,159
plants that contain a lot of cannabidiol

585
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:53,099
maybe they saw our work or maybe they

586
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,380
just learned it from other sources they

587
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,178
found that cannabidiol helps children

588
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,640
with epilepsy there are children that

589
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:04,440
have 20 30 attacks a day

590
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:08,480
well Canada helps them so uh

591
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:12,080
our work on a prevention of

592
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,940
epileptic attacks by cannabidium

593
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,000
is a as an important medical step

594
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:22,700
forward now uh

595
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,619
about 150 children in Israel are getting

596
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,620
extracts with a huge amount huge amount

597
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:31,619
of cannaby diode at the blocks their

598
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:34,918
epileptic attacks so these children

599
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:37,500
would not normally uh

600
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,840
will not be able to develop with 20

601
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,619
attacks a day now they are more or less

602
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,558
normal

603
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:47,038
in the U.S

604
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:49,440
a major study was done based on what we

605
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,798
did 35 years ago yes they showed that

606
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,100
it's a major importance in epilepsy so

607
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:59,220
here we have a medical Advance based on

608
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:02,119
the basic science on identifying

609
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,380
cannabidiol looking at cannabidiolin

610
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:07,319
animals finding out that it's

611
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,539
anti-epileptic then going into humans it

612
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:12,658
doesn't always work that way we show

613
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:15,419
that in Diabetes Type 1 which is an

614
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,580
autoimmune disease cannaby dialysis of

615
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,799
major health well nobody has done that

616
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:21,500
in the humans which is a shame because

617
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:24,658
it helps

618
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:28,740
inanimous exactly the same mechanism it

619
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:31,559
helps with diabetes type 1.

620
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,839
why it has not been tested in humans

621
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,418
it's beyond meat costs a lot of money to

622
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,740
do clinical trials but I have no doubt

623
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,880
that when tested in humans it will show

624
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,000
the same effect

625
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,100
cannabi Dio has been shown to be an

626
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,839
excellent

627
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:51,240
empty schizophrenic drug

628
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:53,699
in schizophrenic patients now

629
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,380
schizophrenia is not a minor disease one

630
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,080
percent of the population in every

631
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,520
country has schizophrenia so we're

632
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,980
dealing with Millions

633
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,259
and this there are drugs against

634
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,360
schizophrenia but they call side effects

635
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:09,599
cannabidiol does not cause side effects

636
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:12,298
and once it is pushed forward chances

637
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:16,079
are that it will become a major anti

638
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:19,379
schizophrenic drugs so uh

639
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:21,720
we see a lot about autoimmune diseases

640
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,120
namely diseases in which the body

641
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,700
attached itself white about the attacks

642
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,158
itself is a complicated question we most

643
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,819
cases don't know much about it but in

644
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,020
essentially on

645
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:35,639
autoimmune diseases that have been

646
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:40,019
tested in animals

647
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,940
we see that cannabidiol helps so the

648
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:45,359
basic work that was done in canopy down

649
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,220
may turn out to be a major importance in

650
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,099
medicine

651
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,679
what can you tell me about the original

652
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,000
science about the anti-epileptic stuff

653
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,840
was that done here

654
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,898
well it was known

655
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:03,439
uh that cannabis is an

656
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:06,959
anti-epileptic agent as a matter of fact

657
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,380
there are all kinds of in the individual

658
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:14,340
reports over hundreds of years on and

659
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:18,539
off and I'd like to quote somebody in

660
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:21,720
the Muslim World a major person in the

661
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:23,058
Muslim world in the 15th century he had

662
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,558
uh

663
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:30,058
epilepsy and somebody brought him

664
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:32,700
cannabis and he didn't have a epileptic

665
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:36,319
attacks but he had to continue taking

666
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:40,558
the drug this was actually

667
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:43,980
written and described by in the 15th

668
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:47,000
century and the document was found about

669
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,380
20 years ago in a

670
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,579
in Paris by

671
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:56,640
a friend of mine Dr Rosendale

672
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,500
this is here we're doing some we are we

673
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,320
have

674
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,960
information of the 15th century and most

675
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,939
probably it was also used for the same

676
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,200
purpose in India to a certain extent

677
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:14,640
India Chinatown so when we started work

678
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,620
we had some individual information but

679
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,899
this is today individual information is

680
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:21,898
not enough when it's information on

681
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:24,839
humans will need a scientific medical

682
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:28,278
way of doing it we need

683
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,798
people that take Placebo namely

684
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:33,419
take the same

685
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,759
solvent or the same drug without the

686
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:39,000
active compound and those that take the

687
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,220
active compound and who is doing the

688
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,380
research should not know who is taking

689
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,298
the placebo and who is taking the active

690
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,880
compound and the end of the research one

691
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:50,819
should do that so we started working on

692
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,899
that we also we always work in

693
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,178
collaboration

694
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:56,099
we collaborate with friends and

695
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:59,159
colleagues all over the world in this

696
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:03,359
case it was with a group in Sao Paulo in

697
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:06,179
Brazil and they we first tested cannabi

698
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:09,298
dial we isolated huge amounts of

699
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:12,538
cannabidio from Cannabis given to us by

700
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:16,200
the police and we send them

701
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:18,119
almost half a kilo of cannaby diode they

702
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,058
first tested it in animals

703
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:23,398
uh Apple animus with epilepsy it worked

704
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:26,460
very well they test them then they went

705
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:29,639
into human patients and they looked at

706
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,038
the human patients for several months so

707
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,919
here is how it is done it has to be done

708
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:37,140
in collaboration between Chemists in

709
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,019
this case our group biologists in that

710
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,799
case the work in Sao Paulo and the

711
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,659
police

712
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,579
and the police that gave us the the

713
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,700
material

714
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:50,398
so uh it has to be done in collaboration

715
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,298
it has to be obviously completely legal

716
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:56,339
and it has to be well planned ahead and

717
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:59,579
we've been doing that in collaboration

718
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:02,519
with many other groups The Addictive the

719
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:06,359
uh research and addiction is done

720
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:09,300
jointly in collaboration by four groups

721
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:11,460
uh for independent groups I mean it

722
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,139
every one of them can say I don't want

723
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,320
to do it well they do because it's

724
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,559
interesting uh the addiction is done by

725
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,899
in collaboration by our group a group in

726
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:24,539
Richmond Virginia a group in Canada and

727
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,460
group in Italy so we work together we

728
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:31,159
correspond we tell each other what's

729
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:35,639
going on and each one of us has his own

730
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:38,700
specialty and it can help the others who

731
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,519
have some other specialty so we do the

732
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:44,759
chemistry and the general background the

733
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,639
general idea of cannabinoids the people

734
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:52,200
at Richmond work on nicotine addiction

735
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:55,079
and and so on the people in uh uh in

736
00:34:52,199 --> 00:35:00,000
Canada worked on opiate addiction and

737
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:03,059
the people in in Italy work on uh

738
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,219
addiction to food actually overeating

739
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,219
and so on Obesity things of that sort

740
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:13,440
um some I've had heard very interesting

741
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,659
things about clinical trials

742
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,980
some doctors have told me and

743
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:18,858
researchers told me that they think

744
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:22,800
clinical trials might need to be

745
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:26,098
adjusted or even reinvented re-thought

746
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,079
of because for cannabis based medicine

747
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,240
because it's because it's effect it

748
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,700
seems to be so individual

749
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,379
uh dead email and someone else said they

750
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,239
completely disagree with that that it

751
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,000
has to stay exactly the same I think

752
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,939
also didn't say exactly the same and

753
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,820
that they have to uh do um just isolates

754
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:48,179
you know and and build up a pharmacology

755
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,500
of of which which cannabinoids that work

756
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,578
together for what what do you think

757
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,739
about that

758
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,119
well you have good research and you have

759
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:55,919
bad research

760
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,140
if you don't do it the right way it's

761
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,920
bad research and the results are not

762
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:06,960
worthwhile but good reason today

763
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:10,680
uh uh advancing in the chemical medical

764
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,699
side has to be done by good research

765
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:17,639
I've originally in animals and then in

766
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:21,239
humans the clinical trials have to be

767
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:23,420
done according to rules that are well

768
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:26,519
accepted by

769
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,639
clinicians now if somebody does a lousy

770
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,039
research well it's a lousy research but

771
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,500
the good research is good research one

772
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:38,519
has to look at the research as it is

773
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,940
done without clinical trials today a

774
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,460
compound cannot become a drug but

775
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,200
through clinical can for cannabis

776
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,579
medicine can we do clinical trials the

777
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:50,819
exact same way we do it for other

778
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,380
medicines same methods yes one can take

779
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,960
compound

780
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,519
canopy dial and give it to

781
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,880
schizophrenics

782
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:02,460
take the same solution that contains the

783
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,260
cannaby dial but also but does not

784
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,858
contain the cannaby diode itself only

785
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,480
the solvents and all the

786
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:12,960
formulation there and give it to other

787
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,179
patients at the placebo these are basic

788
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,019
rules and for example the German group

789
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:20,519
that published on

790
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:23,639
cannabidiolins schizophrenia did an

791
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:27,239
excellent job so the work that was just

792
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:31,199
completed in the U.S and epilepsy a

793
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:34,439
large number of epileptic children it

794
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:37,578
was an outstanding research proposal it

795
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,679
had to be approved by

796
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:43,859
many other clinicians it costs

797
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:45,960
unfortunately Millions to do it but once

798
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:48,799
it's well done it should be well

799
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:53,039
accepted clinicians have to base their

800
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:56,940
work the day-to-day work on clinical

801
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,759
trials and these clinical trials have to

802
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,320
be outstanding can you do clinical

803
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,400
trials with with

804
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,500
um

805
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,500
stuff that's not just isolated compounds

806
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:12,300
like with full spectrum plants

807
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:15,358
well it is more difficult because it's

808
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,400
uh doing it with a single compound one

809
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,319
can

810
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,920
say what are the amounts of the single

811
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,260
compounds how often how it has to be

812
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,019
given and so on when a clinical trial is

813
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,980
done with an extract then what has a

814
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:33,900
problem because the extracts can differ

815
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,019
so I assume that the people you talk to

816
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,940
and were negative

817
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:42,239
thought about

818
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:45,380
extracts and not about the well-defined

819
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:48,598
compounds this is true with working with

820
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,099
extracts may be very complicated and

821
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,960
this is because of something that we

822
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:54,119
discovered many years ago which is

823
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,619
called the Entourage effect the

824
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,460
Entourage effect means that there are

825
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:02,880
compounds in cannabis that change modify

826
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:05,338
the the activity of THC

827
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,640
they by themselves have no activity but

828
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:11,400
they modify the activity of THC so if

829
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,500
you have different compounds every time

830
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,380
you do a clinical trial or an animal

831
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,960
trial as a matter of fact with an

832
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,480
extract which is not exactly the extract

833
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,400
you had previously or somebody else had

834
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,059
previously then obviously you cannot

835
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,059
compare because of the Entourage effect

836
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:32,338
so so is that a is that a barrier for

837
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:35,219
for research how how do you overcome

838
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:37,139
that well you work with well-defined

839
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:39,899
material

840
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:41,519
so okay so about isolate and full

841
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,880
spectrum there are people who have told

842
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:48,300
me very very confidently and adamantly

843
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,338
that isolates are not helpful but I

844
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,740
definitely heard the opposite I've heard

845
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:54,599
isolates can be very helpful some people

846
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:57,118
are saying only full spectrum is helpful

847
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,160
and you have to have THC to make the CBD

848
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,780
become you know useful

849
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:02,759
um what do you think about that these

850
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:06,060
are very general statements you have to

851
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:10,980
go into very specific cases uh

852
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:12,838
pure cannabidiol is outstanding in

853
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,460
many diseases

854
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:18,779
there

855
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,639
a lot of people that claim that

856
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,880
a

857
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,338
one has to use

858
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,220
extracts in order to get better effects

859
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:32,279
maybe in some cases this is correct but

860
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,578
in order to to do a clinical trial one

861
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:39,119
has to do it with

862
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:41,220
well-defined extracts so uh

863
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,480
this is where we stand

864
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:48,059
think so is so is pure cannabidiol

865
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,820
useful in many many indications that

866
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:55,699
you've seen so far yes as I said in we

867
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:59,220
did work on epilepsy with 100

868
00:40:55,699 --> 00:41:01,078
cannabidiol pure crystalline the people

869
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:05,219
in Germany need a

870
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:08,839
uh work on schizophrenia with 100 pure

871
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:11,480
cannabidiol the work in

872
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:14,358
epilepsy in the state the clinical trial

873
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,858
was done with

874
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:21,779
compound which was

875
00:41:16,858 --> 00:41:22,920
a almost pure CBD extracted from the

876
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,700
plant

877
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:30,180
and the reason they did it is because

878
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:34,399
an extract from a plant falls under

879
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:37,919
different legal definition in the states

880
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,300
a pure compound has that's what I

881
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,338
understand I'm not a legal person

882
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,500
a compound

883
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:50,239
that dispute has falls under the

884
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,559
jurisdiction of the FDA

885
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,719
extract of a plant

886
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,960
is something else so it's easier to do

887
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,959
yeah

888
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,720
yeah well the extra you see plant

889
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,380
extracts in the states

890
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:11,459
uh

891
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:15,358
uh seen legally in a different way so

892
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:18,358
you have a 50 billion dollar business of

893
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:22,259
extracts various plant extracts in the

894
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:24,179
state and the FD has essentially it

895
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:28,440
cannot say anything about them

896
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:31,139
uh uh this is not the same as pure drugs

897
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,440
pure compounds the FDA has a lot to say

898
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:35,960
about them so legally the two different

899
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,420
uh

900
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:43,139
legal situations what do we know about

901
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,700
um about cannabis in pregnancy and in

902
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,739
birth and in women's health in general

903
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:50,059
is that and and its effect on the mother

904
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:52,019
and the fetus well generally

905
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:54,059
most

906
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,159
women that

907
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:59,099
still take cannabis

908
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,259
uh say they're nothing major has

909
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:04,440
happened but sometimes he sort of

910
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:08,420
thought that the children that are born

911
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:12,260
maybe smaller and

912
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:17,519
develop more or less

913
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:21,000
normally but basically I would strongly

914
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:24,300
recommend not to use anything during

915
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,760
pregnancy not cannabis not any any drug

916
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:30,619
if possible

917
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,619
because it's extremely difficult to

918
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:37,079
to know exactly what's going on if you

919
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,779
have a drug which causes damage to the

920
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,640
fetus in 50 percent of the cases this

921
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,319
will be seen immediately but what

922
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:49,379
happens if the damage is seen only in

923
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:53,219
one fetus out of 1000

924
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:56,220
it is not seen in any clinical trial

925
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:59,818
but the one damage is one damage that

926
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:02,159
particular damaged baby is damaged and

927
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:05,759
we don't know it's extremely difficult

928
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:09,118
to prove anything of that sort I mean

929
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,020
we need statistical proofs

930
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,539
it is very difficult to work with

931
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:18,000
effects that with things that affect

932
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:20,099
I don't know half a percent of the

933
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,400
population or half percent of the

934
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:27,119
fetuses and uh

935
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,858
what I would normally suggest

936
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:34,200
if a pregnant woman asked me may I take

937
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:37,739
cannabis because it lowers the vomiting

938
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:40,439
I have during the pregnancy I say well

939
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:43,618
too bad just suffer the vomiting and

940
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,740
don't take anything any drug

941
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:49,140
but isn't that true for for any disease

942
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:51,000
that anyone has because you can say well

943
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:54,000
we haven't

944
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,920
we haven't checked it on on 10 000

945
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,079
people yet so maybe it will do damage

946
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,659
even though it helps many people well

947
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,660
this is probably true for all kinds of

948
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:06,239
minor effects but there we know that in

949
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:08,578
a disease it helps the disease pregnancy

950
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,019
is not a disease pregnancy is a normal

951
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,000
thing

952
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:14,039
so are there are there any things that

953
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,699
you would have done

954
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:20,159
just since 1964 was this THC isolation

955
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:21,239
right so so since since then is there is

956
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,219
there anything you would have done

957
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:26,578
differently that you think would have

958
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:28,259
changed in any way the way that it's the

959
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,339
in this the industry I'm calling it has

960
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,400
gone

961
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:34,739
well scientifically probably not

962
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,338
probably I could have got more money to

963
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:42,118
do more research but basically we went

964
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:47,659
the right way what I should have done

965
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:51,960
better is try to get industrial interest

966
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:55,699
and still although we know that these

967
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:58,220
compounds have activity cannaby dial

968
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:00,838
derivatives cannabi dial

969
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:05,219
they're still not

970
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:07,679
sold as defined drugs and possibly I

971
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:10,559
could have pushed more for that for

972
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:13,440
example Tema the biggest company in this

973
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:17,880
in Israel the biggest pharmaceutical

974
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,639
company is not really interested was not

975
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:24,420
interested chances are that we could

976
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:27,239
have pushed more for that well we did

977
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:30,480
so so but scientifically you feel like

978
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:32,959
everything was done the right way well

979
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,019
maybe it could have been done faster

980
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,358
maybe the group could have been larger

981
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:41,099
we always had my group was always a

982
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,679
small group of three or four people

983
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:48,599
working in different aspects

984
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:50,159
um no I can't say most of the work we do

985
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,160
is collaboration

986
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:55,940
we do a lot of collaboration with many

987
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,980
other groups I mean

988
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:01,679
research that is done between chemistry

989
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:04,019
and biology one needs good collaboration

990
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:08,460
between the chemists and the biologists

991
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:11,400
and over the last 30 40 years we have

992
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,358
always had collaborators in various

993
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,039
fields

994
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:15,900
and

995
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:20,338
every

996
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:23,220
a aspect anything that we do now is

997
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:27,059
always in collaboration with people that

998
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:29,939
are well informed know how to do the

999
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:33,259
biology or the clinical work and so on

1000
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,260
do you think there's a

1001
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:42,420
over the years with cannabis research

1002
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:46,440
I see the biggest problem

1003
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,780
in cannabis research cooperation between

1004
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,380
different nations scientists from

1005
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,500
different countries because karabis is

1006
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:59,059
stigmatized and it's illegal drug just

1007
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:03,539
to exchange of samples is a big problem

1008
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:06,000
so some sometimes analyzed locally and

1009
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:08,880
we cannot compare these samples in

1010
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,679
abroad so we can do locally

1011
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:17,160
even different studies but it's problem

1012
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:19,679
to do it in the other country because

1013
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,838
when I ask when my friend in United

1014
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,960
States for some

1015
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:27,299
cannabis standards he told me you know

1016
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,818
this permits export import it's such

1017
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,400
complicated better come to here and do

1018
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:36,659
it here it will be without any problems

1019
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,559
so I see this is a certain break you

1020
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:41,219
know

1021
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:44,099
yeah but do you feel do you feel like

1022
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:47,639
you if people rolled their eyes at you

1023
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:50,160
over the years and and do you feel

1024
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,139
did you feel stigmatized over the years

1025
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,818
from people did people look down at any

1026
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,920
of you for the research that you're

1027
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:58,679
doing other scientists they ever say oh

1028
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,920
those are the guys that do marijuana you

1029
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:05,699
know not in my case I can't I can't

1030
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:08,539
complain I've uh the fact the fact is

1031
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:12,899
that I've been uh uh

1032
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:15,239
given prices all over the world in by uh

1033
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,539
in many countries I have a honorary

1034
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:22,799
doctorates from the U.S and Canada

1035
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:25,259
yeah and so on the day-to-day level you

1036
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,119
know from people that you meet is it

1037
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,460
always is it always like a joke to other

1038
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,858
people or people who don't understand no

1039
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:33,858
as a matter of fact most people think

1040
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:37,880
that it's important to do

1041
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:41,159
if somebody thinks uh otherwise

1042
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,700
we're a Open Country let him think

1043
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:43,699
otherwise

1044
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:46,880
I think that's

1045
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:54,420
Israel I never have problems we

1046
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:57,420
cooperate it also with criminalists

1047
00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:00,960
was no problem on medicinal level on

1048
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,900
matter as a drug of abuse

1049
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,760
so I don't compl I cannot complain just

1050
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,900
only this

1051
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,780
relations International you know this is

1052
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,380
a little bit problem because of

1053
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,019
ricardity

1054
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,838
yes let me give you an example of what

1055
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:22,199
lumir is saying I collaborate with a

1056
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:25,739
group in in the UK a well-established

1057
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:29,059
group in the UK the person that has that

1058
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:33,419
group has a Knighthood he's sir

1059
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:36,358
and so on but I cannot send him the

1060
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:40,380
derivatives of cannabi dial because of

1061
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:44,400
legal problems in the UK they don't he

1062
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,838
he heads was head of a major group at

1063
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,900
Oxford

1064
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:51,480
he's not somebody

1065
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:53,480
who does who is on the side he's at the

1066
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,119
center of

1067
00:50:53,480 --> 00:51:00,358
British research highly regarded and yet

1068
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:03,960
I cannot send him the compounds because

1069
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:07,318
of legal problems pity

1070
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,880
ridiculous yes it is ridiculous

1071
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:10,858
because they're not giving them to

1072
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,318
humans then going to test these

1073
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:15,838
compounds in the test tube and they're

1074
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:18,058
going to test these compounds in animals

1075
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,400
and if they are

1076
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:23,880
and good drugs then they have to go

1077
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,280
through the official legal things in

1078
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,800
order to get into the humans but nobody

1079
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,960
says it

1080
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,359
he's doing anything illegal in the

1081
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,579
country wasn't it frustrating to work

1082
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,980
for years with this stuff that's just

1083
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,079
that's completely illegal outside I

1084
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,179
understand you have to study things that

1085
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,400
are illegal but is it frustrating

1086
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:46,199
because you're discovering hey it's it

1087
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,059
works for epilepsy but we can't give it

1088
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:51,019
to anyone because it's illegal

1089
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,019
Celebi

1090
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,400
were you ever ready to give up because

1091
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:00,300
of that

1092
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,940
no no why should I

1093
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:05,160
did you ever feel frustrated

1094
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,280
you know concerning the research I was

1095
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:10,019
every time very satisfied it was every

1096
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,160
time Vander for

1097
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:17,759
we can share any our ideas on paper on

1098
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:20,750
emails it's no problem only what's

1099
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,400
mentioned professor meshugram

1100
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:25,980
[Music]

1101
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,838
it's complicated what I told you that my

1102
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,420
friend told me just come it's no problem

1103
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,940
so as you can see he he wrote me come

1104
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,838
it's no problem it's no problem but send

1105
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,079
it

1106
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:39,838
it's a complicated

1107
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:42,660
even I think if I want to bring some

1108
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:45,119
samples from the other lip here you know

1109
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:47,098
I need certain pyramid because I cannot

1110
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,119
take it and go by car and have the

1111
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:50,880
sample

1112
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,338
I I need to have sample this permit

1113
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,140
because it stopped me some police that

1114
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:57,838
they say that I have some sample from

1115
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:00,779
cannabis and I don't have permitism it

1116
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:04,159
can be problem yeah never happened to me

1117
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:07,440
but theoretically I'm talking about it

1118
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:10,019
so okay so so what where do you see this

1119
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,420
going in terms of how do you see this

1120
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:13,800
getting uh can I have noid medicine

1121
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,659
getting

1122
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,400
um into the Pharma into into

1123
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:19,019
pharmaceutical drugs how do you see the

1124
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,099
process happening well things are

1125
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:22,318
changing

1126
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:25,740
uh

1127
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:28,500
Israel is a matter of fact it's uh

1128
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:30,019
pretty well ahead of many other

1129
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,960
countries

1130
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:36,780
medical cannabis it can be administered

1131
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,960
here one needs an approval

1132
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:43,380
by the ministry or by physicians that

1133
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:46,079
have uh that are associated with the

1134
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:49,318
ministry they're about 35

1135
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,519
000 patients that have approval which is

1136
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:54,558
a huge number for a certain for

1137
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:57,420
well-defined diseases

1138
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:01,040
particularly uh

1139
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:03,318
in a diseases that are not associated

1140
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:07,219
with the

1141
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:11,759
Psychiatry every almost everything else

1142
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:15,000
in order to work with cannabis a group

1143
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,880
has to get approval by the ministry and

1144
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,099
there is a committee a major committee

1145
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,539
that sits every three months and it so

1146
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,640
happens the time chairman of the

1147
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:26,460
committee

1148
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,858
so I collaborate with the ministry and

1149
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,079
we are very

1150
00:54:27,858 --> 00:54:33,299
liberal in allowing people to do

1151
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:35,400
research in cannabis somebody wants to

1152
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,740
do research in his background in his

1153
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,639
backyard well we'll say no because

1154
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:45,118
that's a way just to use to make legal

1155
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:49,098
cannabis into illegal cannabis but if

1156
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:52,400
it's done in a university or a

1157
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:57,119
well-established unit

1158
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:59,460
governmental company then they have no

1159
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,539
problem doing research and that today

1160
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:04,740
they are

1161
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:06,599
no I don't know probably 50 60 labs in

1162
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:09,598
this country they do research in

1163
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:11,940
cannabis in various aspects of cannabis

1164
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,640
did you ever expect that when you were

1165
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:17,039
starting out that cannabis and marijuana

1166
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:20,098
will become your your life's work

1167
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,619
well yeah this is one of the topics

1168
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:26,220
we've worked on I am a natural products

1169
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:29,519
chemist I work on the chemistry of

1170
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:32,459
natural products on the chemistry plants

1171
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,460
produce a lot of compounds contrary to

1172
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:38,039
humans so

1173
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:40,500
mammalians we produce all of us produce

1174
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,358
the same type of compounds we produce

1175
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,599
the same type of compounds more or less

1176
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,619
like a cow or a

1177
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:50,519
duck or a pig

1178
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:52,980
not with the plants because we have a

1179
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,920
immune system plants don't have a

1180
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,260
specific immune system their immune

1181
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,980
system is based to a large extent and

1182
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:04,500
compound they produce and every plant

1183
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,179
family has more or less the same type of

1184
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,980
compounds but there are many families

1185
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:11,279
and therefore there are thousands of

1186
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:14,659
compounds in the plants so this is a

1187
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,460
well-established field of chemistry

1188
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:19,379
chemistry of natural products if you

1189
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,838
look at a plant of one type plant if

1190
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,240
another type we find many different

1191
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,818
types of compounds and most of these

1192
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:30,899
compounds their structures are unknown

1193
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:33,239
or their activities are known so my

1194
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,960
group has worked for the last 50 years

1195
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:39,118
on the chemistry of and biology of

1196
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,220
natural products

1197
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,480
and and are you optimistic about where

1198
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:43,799
it's all going

1199
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,019
well

1200
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:49,200
I don't think about optimistic or

1201
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:52,019
pessimistic we want to establish things

1202
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:54,358
uh hopefully they will turn out to be

1203
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:58,800
positive in the sense that they can be

1204
00:56:54,358 --> 00:57:03,679
used further on but uh that doesn't uh

1205
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:07,640
depend on any academic lab we are

1206
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:09,719
we can't do much about it we could

1207
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:11,578
investigate something

1208
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:13,799
you can show that something is happening

1209
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:17,220
we can talk to the people that are

1210
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,800
involved in promoting a compound but we

1211
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:23,219
can't go further on the clinical trials

1212
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:26,220
today contrary to what was in the past

1213
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:27,239
cost a lot a lot of money give you an

1214
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:31,199
example

1215
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:33,479
when a hundred years ago insulin was

1216
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:36,899
discovered and insulin is the compound

1217
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:40,139
that our body makes in order to regulate

1218
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,300
the sugars in our body it was used

1219
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:44,519
immediately as a drug it's an excellent

1220
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:48,539
drug still being used in one way or

1221
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:51,300
another the insulin anandamide which we

1222
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:53,759
discovered 25 years ago has never been

1223
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:57,000
given to a human never

1224
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,640
insulin was given within six months and

1225
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,920
then the bite probably is a pretty good

1226
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:04,618
drug but it has never been given to a

1227
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,659
human because a company has to be

1228
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:11,280
interested and has to spend many

1229
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:13,558
millions of uh downloads to develop so

1230
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,660
are you are you surprised when you look

1231
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,599
around and see just how big this is

1232
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:20,039
becoming and how accepted this is

1233
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:22,260
becoming and how much research there is

1234
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:23,759
relative to when you were just well I'm

1235
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,900
I'm delighted

1236
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:31,140
uh uh I'm delighted that the medical uh

1237
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:33,559
part of it is developing slowly but it

1238
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:36,838
is developing one should

1239
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:39,839
separate the medical use from the

1240
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:42,019
recreational use the medical use has to

1241
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:44,519
go according to

1242
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:46,699
well-established medical routes

1243
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:49,500
it has to go through

1244
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:52,618
toxicity and animals and then into the

1245
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,940
humans it has in order to be accepted by

1246
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:57,180
The Physicians

1247
00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:00,599
it has to follow the well-established

1248
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:01,980
medical rules recreational use is a

1249
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:05,220
social issue

1250
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:09,199
a recreational use has to be decided by

1251
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:13,219
the population whether it's toxic or not

1252
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:15,480
uh that's something else uh obviously

1253
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:19,379
populations all over the world have

1254
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:22,079
decided or decided a 100 to 200 years

1255
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:24,539
ago that smoking tobacco is fine the

1256
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,660
fact that people die out of uh smoking

1257
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:30,358
tobacco doesn't matter it has been

1258
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:33,659
socially accepted the same is true for

1259
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:36,838
let's say whiskey 50 alcohol definitely

1260
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:39,239
not very healthy but it is approved but

1261
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:42,420
this is a social issue one cannot come

1262
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:45,779
over and say we should be allowed to use

1263
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:48,358
cannabis recreationally because it helps

1264
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,460
with epilepsy what's the logic there

1265
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:52,558
there is no logic these two things

1266
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,240
should be completely separated one is

1267
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,500
the medical issue the other is a social

1268
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,759
issue

1269
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,798
I was going to ask you before about

1270
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,079
anandamide it's really interesting

1271
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:03,420
of we think of cannabis medicine as

1272
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:06,900
cannabinoid based but we don't ever

1273
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:10,559
think about it as endocannabinoid based

1274
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:12,780
it will be 10 years from now should it

1275
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,760
be of course why

1276
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,640
because these are compounds that we make

1277
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:21,319
if we make if our body makes a compound

1278
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:24,179
it makes it for a certain reason and

1279
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:27,539
we more or less know what the reasons

1280
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:31,618
are and there is no doubt that at some

1281
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:32,940
point people will start using it let me

1282
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:35,760
give you an example from a different

1283
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,318
field there is a compound in our body

1284
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,200
called dopamine

1285
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:43,500
and there is a major dopaminergic system

1286
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:45,719
well it was known but it slowly it was

1287
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,659
slowly discovered that the lack of

1288
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:52,139
dopamine causes one disease and too much

1289
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:55,980
dopamine causes another disease uh too

1290
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:58,259
much is causes schizophrenia so in order

1291
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:01,079
to block

1292
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:03,619
if there isn't enough in Parkinson's

1293
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,660
disease for example one gives

1294
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:09,180
dopaminergic type compounds of the body

1295
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:12,358
if there is a lot of if there is

1296
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:15,659
schizophrenia one tries to lower that so

1297
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:19,199
the body has to have a

1298
01:01:15,659 --> 01:01:21,058
certain amount of dopamine not too much

1299
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:24,298
and not too little the same is probably

1300
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:29,040
true for an antibyte people have come

1301
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:31,318
out and claiming without any major proof

1302
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,739
that migraine for example

1303
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:35,420
is due to

1304
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:39,838
maybe

1305
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:42,180
a lack of anandabite maybe but of course

1306
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:44,519
it's very difficult to do work and a

1307
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:46,318
migraine because if you ask a mouse do

1308
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,559
you have migraine he doesn't want to

1309
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:51,960
answer you but basically it seems to be

1310
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:54,420
maybe it's true so it has to be

1311
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:58,139
investigated if in many of these

1312
01:01:54,420 --> 01:02:00,780
diseases we find that anandamite or 2ag

1313
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:02,519
the two endogenous cannabinoids uh there

1314
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:07,280
is too much of them or too little of

1315
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:07,280
them maybe we can do something about it

1316
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:20,279
we thought of as

1317
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:21,380
a nourishment issue like in other words

1318
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,359
that

1319
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:26,940
that if we we're not having enough not

1320
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:29,159
making enough endocannabinoids we need

1321
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:31,200
cannabinoid nourishment for some reason

1322
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:34,440
well possibly

1323
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:36,239
I mean this is still being investigated

1324
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:40,440
but the fact that the endocannabinoid

1325
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:44,399
system is involved in a huge huge number

1326
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:47,720
of diseases then obviously we have to

1327
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,720
think along those lines

1328
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,400
you're most welcome in that case

1329
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:55,858
thank you

1330
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,780
um I just I was hoping to have you guys

1331
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:59,460
talk about something or other about

1332
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:01,140
research but I don't I don't really know

1333
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,880
about what because this was an idea well

1334
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:05,960
if you wanted for second or two we can

1335
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,960
talk I would love it yeah

1336
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:12,660
do you see any difference between the

1337
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:16,019
attitude in in the check state which you

1338
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:18,139
know very well before previously

1339
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:22,619
a communist

1340
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:24,858
time or a bit later and the attitude

1341
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,858
today

1342
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:29,759
of course in communistic regime

1343
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,460
everything was prohibited it was not

1344
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,240
such easy and we work on cannabis

1345
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:38,940
interface I started to work at 1970 by

1346
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:42,118
the way the first day when I came to

1347
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:44,639
Professor Karachi the first name which I

1348
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:48,119
was familiar with was Professor Rafael

1349
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:50,699
dashura this was even at that time

1350
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,640
leading Authority and this was the main

1351
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:55,919
brain concern in

1352
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:58,879
canabinoid research so this was what I

1353
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:02,720
met but in

1354
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:05,298
Czechoslovakia Professor Karachi history

1355
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:08,519
1950 when he discovered

1356
01:04:05,298 --> 01:04:11,358
antibiotical principle so we start to

1357
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:15,239
use it in medicine and it was used up to

1358
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:18,838
1990 when I left for one year to Israel

1359
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:23,399
what is 25 28 years ago

1360
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:24,539
so it became illegal even then from 1961

1361
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,539
it was

1362
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:28,858
illegal drug we use it without any

1363
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:32,599
problem

1364
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:37,679
for treatment of patients in hospital I

1365
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:40,200
I prepared extracts 20 years to the

1366
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,539
drugstore and they prepared medicine for

1367
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:44,759
hospital without any problem we

1368
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:47,699
cultivated cannabis without fence I

1369
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:50,280
never lost one leaf if we cultivated on

1370
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:53,939
the same spot today overnight there will

1371
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,920
be no cannabis and before patients were

1372
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:58,980
retreated without any problem

1373
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,420
today cannabis is legal in Czech

1374
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,480
Republic five years

1375
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,818
and they use only five kilogram in five

1376
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:09,420
years in the fact it's not accessible

1377
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:11,539
for patients and something like sativas

1378
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,760
which is allowed it's not accessible

1379
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:19,440
because it's more expensive than its

1380
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:23,280
tension of old ill person so I see

1381
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:28,920
certain problem here because illegality

1382
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:32,040
became like a harder harder pressure on

1383
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:34,740
that than than before and today

1384
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:39,000
situation is worse but you are

1385
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:41,699
associated I know that you travel to a

1386
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,500
lot of East European countries you have

1387
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:46,259
been in uh

1388
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,539
almost all the small countries in

1389
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:51,480
Eastern Europe and what's the situation

1390
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:55,039
there the best situation is today we had

1391
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,039
several seminars in Macedonia

1392
01:05:55,639 --> 01:06:01,858
cannabis

1393
01:05:57,298 --> 01:06:04,079
for treatment is illegal since last year

1394
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:09,539
the most

1395
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:12,059
medicinal compound is considered THC

1396
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:15,440
it's strange that CBD is not considered

1397
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:20,460
like medicine like this is concept like

1398
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:22,980
supportive compound Maine is THC so

1399
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,440
there can be extracts without any limit

1400
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:29,699
of

1401
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:34,858
THC contents in the sample

1402
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:37,318
I was many times in Slovenia even we had

1403
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:42,358
seminar in Parliament

1404
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:45,538
it's still illegal the same in Serbia in

1405
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:48,480
Croatia where we had seminars several

1406
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:51,480
times it's still illegal just only

1407
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,480
Macedonia

1408
01:06:53,039 --> 01:07:01,039
better situation maybe is in Austria

1409
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,940
because there are they sell CBD

1410
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,299
extracts

1411
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:09,000
like five pair Center ten percent CBD

1412
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:11,038
you can buy it without any problem it's

1413
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,338
legal

1414
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,980
in Czechoslovakia I said it was used for

1415
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:19,558
treatment today in Slovakia what is

1416
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:20,639
separate country today everything is

1417
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:24,660
illegal

1418
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:27,058
cannabis CBD everything is illegal like

1419
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:28,858
in the United States so situation

1420
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:32,099
between Czech Republic and Slovak

1421
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:33,900
Republic it's quite a different and in

1422
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:36,298
Czechoslovakia mainly cannabis was

1423
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,559
cultivated in Slovakia

1424
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:41,038
today

1425
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:43,559
well in the U.S of course things are

1426
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,680
different because you have one stated

1427
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:49,380
cannaby diode can be freely sold and so

1428
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:52,199
on another one when it's illegal so if

1429
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:54,358
you have one gram of cannaby dial in

1430
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:56,818
your pocket on this side of the border

1431
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:59,818
state border not yes country border

1432
01:07:56,818 --> 01:08:05,279
state border you're fine you you just

1433
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:09,239
walk at 10 meters so past the frontier

1434
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:12,480
then you can go to prison for five years

1435
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:14,939
so the same that doesn't make much sense

1436
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,439
but that's the situation the same is

1437
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:18,659
this alcohol when I was in the United

1438
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:20,879
States there was County

1439
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:21,899
but I was it was prohibited to buy

1440
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,900
alcohol

1441
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:25,798
but one meter after the border of this

1442
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:28,079
County

1443
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:30,238
was liquor store and you can buy it so

1444
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:34,140
so chances are that things will change

1445
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:37,139
within the next couple of years we shall

1446
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:39,060
have most probably

1447
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:42,060
plant material

1448
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:44,819
basically cannabi dial and derivatives

1449
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:48,120
which come from the plant but companies

1450
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:50,120
will develop derivatives and derivatives

1451
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:53,039
will be sold you see

1452
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:56,179
the natural products are not always sold

1453
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:59,698
because of various reasons

1454
01:08:56,179 --> 01:09:02,520
let's look at penicillin you cannot buy

1455
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:04,439
penicillin in the drugstore penicillin

1456
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:07,199
is not available as a drug

1457
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:09,178
you have derivatives of penicillin

1458
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:11,939
chances are that we shall have the same

1459
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:14,279
with cannabis but because of the wide

1460
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:17,519
use of plant cannabis you will have

1461
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:21,359
plant cannabis sold for many years and

1462
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,960
you will also have derivatives of mostly

1463
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:28,319
cannabidiol and there you are so you

1464
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:31,020
have two different types of drugs in

1465
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:34,560
fact we need a lot of experimental

1466
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:37,380
studies and trials clinical trials

1467
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:40,020
because up to now whenever I prepared

1468
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:43,140
the derivatives of cannabis

1469
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:46,739
it was like successful but at the end it

1470
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:49,579
was not successful yes only I think

1471
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:52,379
nabilon is used but not the other one

1472
01:09:49,579 --> 01:09:56,100
except of that I use just cannabis

1473
01:09:52,380 --> 01:10:00,420
extracts like dronabino Marino this is

1474
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:03,900
THC or epideolx what is CBD but others

1475
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:07,440
like was one derivative for obesity

1476
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:11,819
and then patients were depressed even

1477
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:14,579
commit suicide so it's not such easy to

1478
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:16,619
prepare derivative it's very

1479
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:18,420
we cannot do it at the University this

1480
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:21,000
can do only Rich pharmaceutical

1481
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:22,739
companies and chances about five percent

1482
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,039
and they must

1483
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:29,759
use spent tens of millions of dollars

1484
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:32,158
for yeah so it's not also such easy for

1485
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,980
pharmaceutical companies well I hope it

1486
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:37,019
will change we as you well know we work

1487
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:38,819
now with three or four companies in

1488
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:41,219
different aspects

1489
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:44,099
they are spending their money in order

1490
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:46,460
to advance cannabinoid research and to

1491
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:49,620
advance cannabinoid drugs ultimately

1492
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:53,100
hopefully they will succeed

1493
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:55,439
I hope also because you had from the

1494
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:57,659
time when I came to the university and I

1495
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,299
I heard of your name for the first time

1496
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:02,759
you had so many wonderful ideas and some

1497
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:06,300
of them up to now were not fulfilled

1498
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,520
because of illegality yeah well there we

1499
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,980
are I hope that uh

1500
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:14,580
you did you didn't tell us the last word

1501
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:17,759
still I am sure that your continual

1502
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:20,698
contributions will be wonderful and that

1503
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,800
uh thank you it will help your patience

1504
01:11:20,698 --> 01:11:24,658
wait what kind of ideas that have not

1505
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,699
been fulfilled

1506
01:11:24,658 --> 01:11:30,059
well uh

1507
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:34,139
the development of many of the synthetic

1508
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:35,580
compounds which are known to to be

1509
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:38,640
pretty good

1510
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:41,640
in animals they have not Advanced to

1511
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,900
clinical trials as a matter of fact the

1512
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:47,340
schizophrenia trial which was then

1513
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:50,099
obviously in human patients and so on

1514
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:51,679
has not Advanced cannabi dial to be

1515
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,179
accepted as an

1516
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:56,119
anti-schizophrenic drug which is very

1517
01:11:54,179 --> 01:12:00,800
strange but that's what's going on

1518
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:04,019
chances are the derivatives will will be

1519
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,779
better accepted we have made derivatives

1520
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:11,640
of cannabidiol which are

1521
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:14,219
better than cannabis itself so chances

1522
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,920
are that sometime within the next decade

1523
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:20,158
who knows uh

1524
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:23,940
cannabinoid drugs will be on the market

1525
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:25,079
and will be widely used what's a

1526
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,500
derivative

1527
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:30,559
well we have published for example

1528
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:35,460
cannot be done with the fluorine

1529
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:37,679
atom on on the cannabidiol molecule so

1530
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:39,960
it's a fluoro cannaby dial we have

1531
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,359
published that in collaboration with the

1532
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,859
group in South America we have shown

1533
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:49,738
that it is uh pretty good in anxiety

1534
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:52,219
lowering anxiety pretty good in acting

1535
01:12:49,738 --> 01:12:52,218
on

1536
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:58,020
other psychiatric diseases

1537
01:12:55,158 --> 01:13:00,539
we have shown that cannabidiol itself is

1538
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:02,460
pretty good in these things we have

1539
01:13:00,539 --> 01:13:06,238
recently shown that another derivative

1540
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:10,079
which is a derivative of the acid of

1541
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:14,039
cannabidiol uh helps with the depression

1542
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:16,698
so chances are that at some point some

1543
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:19,340
of these compounds will

1544
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:22,678
will become

1545
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:25,980
major drugs you see depression and

1546
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:27,560
anxiety for example a major diseases in

1547
01:13:25,979 --> 01:13:30,799
Western Society

1548
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:33,719
a huge number huge

1549
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:38,520
percentages of the population have

1550
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:41,460
anxiety or depression on and off

1551
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:44,699
and we need compounds that do not cause

1552
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:47,520
side effects we need simple compounds or

1553
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:48,859
compound data we well one doesn't have

1554
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,199
to be

1555
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:56,279
anxious taking the compounds against

1556
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:57,779
anxiety what is what is the role of

1557
01:13:56,279 --> 01:14:01,079
anecdotal

1558
01:13:57,779 --> 01:14:03,779
um evidence in in this research

1559
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:05,880
well anecdotal is

1560
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:10,920
according to the work anecdotal I mean

1561
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:12,960
you have a person in uh in Paraguay who

1562
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:16,440
knows where saying that it helps against

1563
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:19,039
a certain disease that he has which is

1564
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:22,500
well uh

1565
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:25,260
academic person will say that's an

1566
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:28,500
interesting observation but until we

1567
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:31,340
have a clinical trial it's just

1568
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:35,640
anecdotal I mean well maybe this person

1569
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:39,860
by chance was getting a better anyway

1570
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:43,560
and he took the drug and well maybe

1571
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:46,939
the the drug has nothing to do with is

1572
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:49,380
getting better we are we have to have

1573
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:51,238
well-established clinical trials but is

1574
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:53,520
there a moment where anecdotal stuff

1575
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:57,019
becomes more than just one one story

1576
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:59,159
that's not useful is it well we can base

1577
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:04,500
our work

1578
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:09,179
an anecdotal data but it will never in a

1579
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:12,300
modern society never make a drug make a

1580
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:15,300
compound become a drug

1581
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:18,719
just on the basis of anecdotal evidence

1582
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:21,300
one needs clinical trials without the

1583
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:24,300
clinical trials a new drug will not be

1584
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:28,199
accepted not but in the FDA it will

1585
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:29,820
still be an extract an anecdotal cases

1586
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:32,158
is also a problem

1587
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:34,198
that even if it was successful this

1588
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:36,839
patient don't know which type of

1589
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:40,678
cannabis they use if it was high THC or

1590
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:43,260
high CBD and so on and I won't return to

1591
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:46,140
this what was not fulfilled professor

1592
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:50,460
michelam already mentioned it that 35

1593
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:54,300
years ago they did legal research this

1594
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:57,719
group from Brazil and they found that

1595
01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:00,840
epilepsy can be treated with CBD nothing

1596
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:04,198
happened it was supposed to be a regular

1597
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:07,860
case or officially by the law illegal

1598
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:10,859
case that parents treated child

1599
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:10,859
rich

1600
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,600
color piece

1601
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:18,559
and they found that it can create this

1602
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,900
drawer syndrome for this heart type of

1603
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:24,780
epilepsy and then it was fulfilled what

1604
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:27,479
was ideal already 35 years ago and this

1605
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:29,399
was legal idea and was supposed to be

1606
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:32,879
illegal

1607
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:34,619
practice just to fulfill

1608
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,940
I'll give you and this is the last

1609
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:38,719
example

1610
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:42,000
we have about a hundred

1611
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:44,000
autoimmune diseases about 10 of them are

1612
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,100
very Central autoimmune diseases

1613
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,520
Diabetes Type 1 rheumatoid arthritis

1614
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:52,560
many other diseases are

1615
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,400
autoimmune diseases our body attacks

1616
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:58,199
itself

1617
01:16:53,399 --> 01:17:00,479
and most definitely cannabidiol has been

1618
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:03,178
found to act

1619
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:06,539
very positively in autoimmune diseases

1620
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:10,319
as a matter of fact uh

1621
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:12,779
group here at the Berlin Hospital looked

1622
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:16,319
at something that is more or less like

1623
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:17,639
an outer immune disease in many cancer

1624
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,559
patients

1625
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,340
uh

1626
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:27,420
one has to exchange

1627
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:30,179
part of the body the bone marrow with

1628
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:32,399
bone marrow from outside but the body

1629
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:34,380
doesn't like bone marrow from the

1630
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,299
outside and he attacks the bone marrow

1631
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:39,539
the new bone marrow and the new bone

1632
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:41,940
marrow attacks the body and the patient

1633
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:43,979
is sick it has to be done because there

1634
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:47,359
is nothing else that can be done with

1635
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:50,639
these cancer patients but many of them

1636
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:52,738
are sick and this is called graft versus

1637
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,440
cold disease which is an autoimmune

1638
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:57,839
disease more or less well a group with

1639
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:59,879
batism thought I was a little bit

1640
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,159
involved with them I'll group it

1641
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:05,039
Bailey's in hospital thought that maybe

1642
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:08,399
as cannabidiolis and autoimmune disease

1643
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:10,439
drug let's give them cannabidiol they

1644
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:13,920
gave them cannabidiol and the results

1645
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:16,559
were outstanding it definitely helps in

1646
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:19,520
graft versus host disease so a company

1647
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:22,320
has taken up now this particular

1648
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,739
information by the Bellington hospital

1649
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:29,158
and their developing canopy dial as a

1650
01:18:25,738 --> 01:18:32,759
drug in the case of graft versus host

1651
01:18:29,158 --> 01:18:35,879
disease so chances are that we'll have a

1652
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:39,360
canopy dial as a drug

1653
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:41,960
hopefully again within the next three

1654
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:44,759
four five years in this particular case

1655
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,560
cancer being treated

1656
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,840
after bone marrow

1657
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,120
with canopy dial

1658
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,960
okay that was great thank you you're

1659
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:53,960
most welcome okay
