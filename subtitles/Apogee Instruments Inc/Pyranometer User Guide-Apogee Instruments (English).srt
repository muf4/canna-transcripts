00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,839
Today we'll be talking about the proper installation and maintenance of your Apogee pyranometer

2
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,839
to ensure its performance for as many years as

3
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,199
possible. Apogee's parameters are built tough, but they are precision instrument

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,039
so following these steps will ensure the best measurements. First, when choosing a

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,349
location to mount your pyranometer. Make sure it's in a spot that has a

6
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,139
full unobstructed view of the sun throughout the entire day and even

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,280
throughout the entire year for long-term deployment. Periodic shading of the

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,460
sensor from nearby objects will affect the accuracy of the measurement. If you are

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,030
mounting the sensor on a weather station, it's best to mount it to the highest point

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,448
on the tower or at least on the south side of the tower in the northern

11
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:54,798
hemisphere or on the north side of the tower if you are in the southern

12
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:59,689
hemisphere. For global horizontal irradiance measurements, be sure to mount the

13
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:04,099
sensor perfectly level. To make mounting easier Apogee carries a line of

14
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,439
mounting hardware that is designed to fit perfectly with our sensors. The

15
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,819
Apogee AL-100 leveling plate is a stable platform for the sensor and has three

16
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:17,529
adjustment screws and an integrated bubble level. The sensor is mounted directly to the

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,400
plate by threading the included nylon mounting screw through the center hole.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,800
To mount the leveling plate to a cross arm, we recommend the Apogee AM-110

19
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,620
sensor mounting bracket. It is pre-drilled to mate with the leveling plate and

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,290
comes with all the hardware needed to mount it firmly to master pipes up to

21
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,230
two inches in diameter. When using our pyranometer to monitor solar panel

22
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,170
performance, you may opt for a plane of array configuration where the

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,010
sensor is on the same plane as the panel. Again. they AL-100 leveling plate and the

24
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,310
AM-110 mounting bracket can be used to mount the sensors securely, however, you

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,760
can use your own hardware as well. After you mount your sensor you'll need to wire

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,980
it to the datalogger or controler. For this demonstration we'll be using a CR 1000

27
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,500
datalogger from Campbell Scientific, but wiring should be similar for most dataloggers.

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,868
There are a few different configurations that you will need to use

29
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:17,650
depending on which model of pyranometer you have. The output of the SP-110 and SP-230 are

30
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,650
considered self-powered and can be monitored using a differential or single

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,069
ended channel measurement. When wiring to a differential channel simply wire the

32
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,840
sensors red wire to the high and the black wire to the low. The sensors clear

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,280
shield wire should be wired to the dataloggers analog ground for cable

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,009
screening of electromagnetic interference. For single-ended

35
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,289
measurements, wire the sensors red wire to the single-ended channel and then the

36
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:45,030
black and clear wire should be wired to the analog ground.

37
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,539
Wiring the heater circuit of the SP-230 will require a 12 V DC power

38
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:56,289
supply. Connect the white wire of the  +12 V DC signal and the green wire to the

39
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:03,579
negative or ground. The SP-212 and SP-215 provide an amplified voltage output and

40
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,100
therefore require an input voltage in order to operate correctly. Make sure to check

41
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,609
the sensor manual for the proper input voltage range for each model. Cconnect the

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,209
sensors white wire to the positive voltage signal and the clear wire to the

43
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,800
negative or ground of the power source. The sensors green wire is the output and

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,040
should be wired to the single-ended channel or the voltage input to a

45
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,769
controller. The SP-214 provides a 4 to 20 mA output and requires an

46
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,780
input voltage range of 5 to 36 V DC. To power the sensor

47
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,289
connect the red wire to the positive voltage signal and the black wire to the

48
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:43,139
negative or ground of the power source. The clear shield wire should be connected to an

49
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,029
analog ground. Next, wire the white wire to the controllers 4 to 20 mA input and the

50
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,219
green wire to the input ground. Maintaining your Apogee Instrument pyranometer

51
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,250
is a two-part process of making sure the optical path remains clean and

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,639
occasionally checking that you pyranometers calibration is still accurate. Because of

53
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,869
the dome shape of our pyranometers, keeping this sensor head clean is a

54
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,099
relatively easy job. If the sensor does become dirty the next rain should

55
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,719
automatically clean the sensor or you can simply rinse the sensor with water

56
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,189
or even a little window cleaner. If the sensor becomes encrusted with mineral

57
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:21,858
deposits, we recommend that you clean it  with vinegar and a soft cloth. The lens is

58
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,779
made from acrylic, so avoid using cleaners or tools that are abrasive and

59
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:26,909
can scratch the lens.

60
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,970
The next step in your maintenance routine, is to occasionally checking that

61
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,580
your sensor is calibrated properly. Apogee pyranometers have a

62
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:38,359
long-term drift rate of less than 3% per year. For many applications

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,090
this light yearly drift is insignificant, however, accuracy is

64
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:46,560
important. So, in general we recommend that you send your pyranometer to us

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,649
for recalibration every two to three years. However, most pyranometers will drift

66
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:56,299
much less than the 3% a year so you may be able to forego calibration for a

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,410
longer period of time. If you are curious and don't have access to a reference

68
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,650
pyranometer, Apogee instruments  has developed a website called the clear sky calculator

69
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,789
that can provide you with an estimated amount of solar radiation falling on a

70
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,480
horizontal surface, at any time a day in any location of the world. You can go

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,210
to clearskycalculator.com and enter your exact coordinates and a few other

72
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:22,639
parameters to get an accurate reference measurement. If your pyranometer reads

73
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,500
too far off it may be time to send in the sense for recalibration. That's about

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,579
all there is to mounting in maintaining a pyranometer, however, here are a few more

75
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:36,680
little tips and troubleshooting issues you might find useful. One of the simplest

76
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,709
problems we see is people failing to remove the green protective cap from the

77
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:45,279
pyranometer. The green cap is designed for protection of the lens when you are

78
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,089
transporting or storing your pyranometer but needs to be removed when

79
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,979
you're taking readings. A quick and easy check of sensor functionality can be

80
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,830
determined using a voltmeter with millivolt resolution. Connect the

81
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:01,490
positive lead of the voltmeter to the red wire from the sensor and the

82
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,960
negative lead or common to the black wire from the sensor. Direct the sensor's diffuser

83
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,019
toward a light source and verify this sensor provides a signal. Blocking all

84
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:16,000
radiation from the sensor should force the sensor signal to read 0. Finally, if you have

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,439
any questions about your Apogee pyranometer, you can find a lot of information

86
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,889
on a website or feel free to contact our tech support department.

87
