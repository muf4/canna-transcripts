00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
I'm Bruce Bugee, president of Apogee Instruments, and today I'm going to

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:15,480
walk you through the research we did over several years to develop this new

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,750
chlorophyll meter. We had this idea quite some time ago, but it took a lot of R&amp;D

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:29,420
to get this and the work we did is published and publicly available in this

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,730
paper here I've got a copy of it here. We were really pleased that plant cell and

6
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:40,500
environment published this paper. It's one of our top journals because there's a lot

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,009
of detailed physiology in this paper. There is so much detail physiology that I

8
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:50,759
want to walk you through some of it in the next few minutes, with references to

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:57,349
the paper. Here's the meter on a leaf. It's an optical meter, you clamp it down.

10
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,879
Based on the transmission of two wavelengths of light, it converts this in

11
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:12,489
software to a unit of chlorophyll per unit area, and in this case its moles  of

12
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:18,769
chlorophyll per meter squared of leaf. No other meter optical meters in this

13
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:23,129
price range can do that. That's  the unique breakthrough of this meter, but it was not

14
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:28,158
trivial to get to that point. Let's walk through some of the graphs in this paper and

15
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,700
look at what we did. The first thing we did was a massive literature

16
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:43,430
review, and we found that there are over thirty studies on this relationship

17
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,700
between transmission of light and chlorophyll concentration. They started

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:59,090
back in 1986, there was a meter called this SPAD-501, and later in

19
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,490
1992 they came out with the SPAD-502. These are old meters. People are starting to

20
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:10,288
establish this relationship. Here's a critical paper a Moje and Bugbee,

21
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:16,358
1992. This was one of my graduate students Oscar Monje and I. This paper turns out to be

22
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:22,920
one of my top five most highly cited papers, in this list, because we discuss

23
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,059
the inherent limitations of doing this

24
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,699
back in 1992.Then about ten years later, the papers start to show up with an Opti

25
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,828
Sciences meter the CCM-200 getting what we call

26
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:45,450
the optical absolute relationship. In other words, the relationship between

27
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,509
what this meter can read and the true amount of chlorophyll in the

28
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:55,969
leaf. We know this relationship is nonlinear, which is one of the big

29
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:00,509
problems, but the first thing we looked at was how did these studies

30
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:09,120
agree. The studies are on all different species. Let's take a look at that. Here's curves for

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,009
the Minolta meter. This unit by the way,  is not a measurement of

32
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:22,009
chlorophyll. SPAD stands for special products analysis division. It's just the

33
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,060
name of the division in Minolta that developed it. It's not a unit of

34
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,519
chlorophyll concentration. It is a name of the group of people. You can see its

35
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,209
nonlinear going up. But, look at the scattering studies. Here's

36
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:43,299
our studies, the green line right here. Then when we did this

37
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:49,019
again using more modern techniques, 20 to 25 years later.

38
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,129
Modern spectrophotometer, more rigorous extraction techniques, gave us this black

39
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:59,698
line, which is close to the average of all these. Now some people have studied

40
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,669
the Opti Scienes meter and chlorophyll, and that's also nonlinear. It curves

41
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:10,549
the other direction. We did both of these in this paper, but

42
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:16,668
so far this is literature review, except for our study. All it does is show these

43
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:21,519
these papers don't agree. Well why don't they agree? Part of it is

44
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,639
because they're different

45
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,530
species. Different species have chlorophyll arranged in different packets, in

46
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:34,438
different ways so the light transmits differently. This means you really need a line

47
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,229
for each species. However,

48
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:44,180
several papers studied the same species, wheat, and they got different curves for wheat.

49
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,129
We went back and looked at these

50
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:57,158
studies and  not one of them use the right combination of techniques to

51
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:02,569
accurately convert an optical measurement to an absolute measurement.

52
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,949
This is always the absolute measurement, here. Chlorophyll,

53
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,848
which is always what we want to know. This unit down here is what the

54
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:16,019
meter gives us. You have to get several things right to do this: you have to have just

55
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:22,049
the right solvent extraction, you have to have the right equation, and you have

56
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,189
to have the right spectrophotometer. All three of those things have to match, and

57
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:33,060
when we looked at the literature it was very rare for these older papers to do

58
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,189
everything correct, to get the exact right chlorophyll. This includes our own

59
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:44,110
paper from 1992. We realized we didn't use the exact right techniques. When

60
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,759
we did it again, this study means, this plant cell and environment paper right

61
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,939
here, we got this curve. Fortunately the reviewers agreed these are all

62
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,710
the right techniques, that's the gold standard curve that replaces all these

63
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:05,060
previous curves, which are similar but not exactly right.

64
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:13,449
Let me make a point here about the problem with older meters. If you clamp

65
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:21,930
on a leaf and you get a reading of 20, you are on this point in the curve, and you have

66
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,629
about

67
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:30,699
a hundred units of chlorophyll, micromoles of chlorophyll per meter squared. Now you do

68
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:36,990
another leaf, and you get a reading of 40. You conclude the chlorophyll has

69
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:45,090
doubled because the number is twice as high. However, look what happens, we go up here and

70
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:56,359
across, the chlorophyll went up four-fold, between 100 and 400, and our meter only

71
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,139
doubled. There's the problem. We have a lot of bad data in the literature where

72
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:09,129
people are over-reliant on these SPAD units, when they should be reliant on

73
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,370
the actual chlorophyll. That's a pretty dramatic example of

74
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:20,269
the problem and the misinterpretation of data.  So, our goal in all of this was to

75
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:25,870
develop a meter where we could convert in the software of the meter to actual

76
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,670
chlorophyll units in the meter, not a relative index of chlorophyll but actual

77
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:41,620
chlorophyll. How do we do that? Let's take a look. This is a video, shot in the

78
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,060
laboratory, of making an optical measurement with the meter and then very

79
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,290
carefully marking where that measurement was. Underneath this, is the reading

80
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,660
of the amount of chlorophyll that you write down. Now, in order to get the gold

81
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,030
standard you have to take that disc out from the exact same spot on the leaf

82
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:08,219
where the measurement was made.. This is done with a cork borar. We put the disc

83
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,130
into a little vial of dimethylsulfoxide. There's different extraction solvents,

84
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,050
but this is the one of choice. Then mix it up. Looking here you can see

85
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:27,910
this tiny little leaf discs floating in this extraction solvent. Chlorophyll

86
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,939
doesn't come out right away.

87
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:36,340
To speed it up we put it at sixty-five degrees Celsius. Here we are walking over

88
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,349
to a drying oven, putting it into drying oven  with that extraction

89
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:47,550
solvent, and now we wait. It typically takes about three hours until all the

90
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:55,589
chlorophyll is gone from the leaf in solution. The oven is still sixty-five degrees.

91
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:01,040
There's the vile three hours later. Now the disc is white and all the

92
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:07,250
chlorophyll is in solution. So, step one, is extract the chlorophyll. This is one

93
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,740
measurement on one leaf.  The next step, is to bring it into the laboratory

94
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,669
and measure it.

95
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:22,159
Next, transfer it into a cuvette. Measure it in our spectrophotometer, which scans the

96
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,850
appropriate wavelengths and then reads them out on a computer. We will zoom in

97
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:35,220
here for you in just a minute, on these values, which show the absorbance of

98
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,960
those two wavelengths. With those two numbers in the correct equation,

99
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,490
that matches the instrument and the dimethylsulfoxide, we can calculate both

100
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,930
chlorophyll A and B. We add the two values together, and we have chlorophyll.

101
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:58,589
As long as your laboratory procedures are correct, this is how you get the gold

102
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,850
standard of chlorophyll, but it's obviously a lot of work compared to

103
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:12,730
getting a single digital number. One of our concerns was that you can't ever

104
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,460
have a single curve across a wide range of environments to do this because the

105
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,089
arrangement of chlorophyll molecules will change with environment. We tested

106
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:32,030
that in many ways we grew plants in many different environments, and our data

107
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:38,370
pretty clearly indicate environment has a minimal effect on the arrangement of

108
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,269
chlorophyll,

109
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,769
chloroplasts, in a leaf.

110
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:48,698
One of the tests of that was to compare our data for paper birch. This is a

111
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:57,818
widely distributed species. This was studied by Richardson, who is at

112
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:05,789
Yale, in 2002. He did everything right in his extractions. We also measured paper

113
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:12,969
birch, half a continent away, thirty years later, same species. There's a correction

114
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:21,139
in the equation. When we plotted this against Richardson's data, and we got

115
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:27,149
virtually the same line. That helped convince us that this procedure is

116
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:35,220
robust across time and space and  species. Once we get a curve for a species,

117
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,470
that is the curve for that species. That allowed us to take the curves we

118
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:48,189
developed and put them into the software of this meter. So, what are those curves

119
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:57,980
look like? Here's the  index from the meter and the chlorophyll here. You can

120
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,350
see all these nonlinear curves. Some species are similar; wheat rice and

121
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:10,189
barley are similar. Pepper and soy bean have

122
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:15,808
a remarkably high amount of chlorophyll in the leaves, scale change was double

123
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:22,048
these other curves. This is a graphical representation of the curves  for all of these.

124
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:34,708
This is a summary of the species and the numerical equation to linearize

125
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,958
the data and the R squared values.

126
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,678
The R squared values are mostly in the

127
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,399
0.9, here is a 0.97.

128
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,539
There's high correlation, coefficients of determination, for that fit with these

129
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,469
species, which allows us to

130
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,680
convert an optical reading to the absolute reading. This is all published

131
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,319
in the paper.

132
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,660
Here's all the curves for all the species, with the index and then for species

133
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:11,339
that we don't yet have a curve for here's a generic curve, and that's the

134
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,200
equation to convert the reading to absolute chlorophyll content over here.

135
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:23,900
Lots of species. Lots of lines. Only a few species had very dark, very high amounts

136
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:32,269
of chlorophyll. Most of this species are down here. Along the way we were able to

137
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:39,019
develop two very accurate curves for converting among optical units from

138
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:45,750
different meters. These special products analysis division units can now be

139
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,809
converted to chlorophyll content index which is what Opti Sciences uses

140
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:59,219
and vice versa. If you know the CCI you can convert that to SPAD units with these

141
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,660
equations, which are pre-programmed into this Apogee meter. So you can have this

142
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:11,629
meter read out in any of the units of the previous meters in addition to the

143
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:18,789
true chlorophyll units. These are very high correlations 0.98 and 0.99 for

144
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:24,719
these conversion equations. You would think you could do this mathematically

145
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,970
but Minolta has a confidential equation in their meter, and it's it's not known

146
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,910
what the coefficients are. So, we have to do it

147
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:42,750
empirically.  Now, if you likee logarithms in high school and

148
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,200
manipulating logarithms you'll be interested in this little section of

149
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,850
this paper, which is a series of five equations that takes us through the

150
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,730
percent transmission all the way down to chlorophyll. This is the mathematical

151
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,000
relationships that are going on because there's two wavelengths coming through

152
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,179
the leaf, and we've ratio of these wavelengths.

153
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:13,379
The reason this needs logarithms is the transmission of light is nonlinear. When

154
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:21,049
you double the pigment you do not cut the transmission in half and

155
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:25,799
you change the absorbance. I'm not going to go through the details right

156
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:33,208
now but this is a ratio of two transmissions, e raised to a power.

157
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,769
There's two wavelengths here. This is critical.

158
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:46,569
Tthis NIR wavelength, which is at about 930 nanometers measures

159
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:54,020
cellulose. This

160
00:15:54,019 --> 00:16:01,319
measures just the cell wall. This red waving, which is at 653 nanometers

161
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:09,020
measures both chlorophyll and cell wall together. There

162
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,319
is no single wavelengths that only gives us chlorophyll; we have to ratio two

163
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,850
wavelengths. Now you can see how by subtraction we can get to chlorophyll,

164
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:27,170
but we have to deal with this nonlinear effect. So, we have e raised to these powers

165
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:36,039
This arranges to e (chlorophyll plus cell wall) minus e (cell wall); take the log of both sides, and slove

166
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,909
that for the logarithm. We get chlorophyll plus cell wall, minus cell wall, equals chlorophyll.

167
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:47,939
Mathematically this is what these meters read. SPAD should

168
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,829
theoretically equal chlorophyll, and the log of the CCI should equall chlorophyll. Know

169
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:56,828
this is all done in software in the meters. You don't need to know this its

170
00:16:56,828 --> 00:17:03,489
just a fun math exercise, if you like following the math. It took us

171
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,720
awhile to work through this in the lab. But, it is very satisfying

172
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,920
once we showed it theoretically.

173
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:19,190
These are the species in the Apogee meter that we have equations for. We're

174
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,150
working on additional equations for this. There's generic equations in

175
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,030
here. The major annual crop species are in here. There's

176
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:38,410
a number of deciduous species, also in this.  So, that's a summary of what we had

177
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:45,350
to do, to make this meter read out in

178
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:55,609
moles of chlorophyll per meter squared,

179
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:00,189
which is what you get with a spectrophotometer, and it's now what you

180
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:07,870
get with this non-destructive optical meter. For details, I refer you to our paper in

181
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:15,969
Plant Cell and Environment. You can contact Apogee for a copy of the paper,

182
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,839
and it's also available on the Internet.

183
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,509
Thanks for listening. We look forward to another visit.
