1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:09,679
So welcome to lecture six in this

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,480
series. Now we are up to conduction and

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:17,640
convection the the final component of

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:21,719
this energy balance analysis. And

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,320
because this follows the same principles

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,839
as

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,160
transpiration, there's a lot of things

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,359
that we it it takes less time to explain

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,520
this principles because it's also flux

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,320
is a driving gradient divided by the

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,840
resistance that ratio.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,359
Remember in the case of the psychometric

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,040
chart we spent a lot of time talking

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,159
about how to calculate the driving

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:53,238
gradient the leaf to air vapor pressure

16
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:55,679
difference. That's requires some

17
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:58,640
calculations in the case of conduction

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:02,000
and convection. However, this is real

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,558
simple because the numerator is just the

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,640
delta T, the delta temperature between

21
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,239
the object and the air. So, it's uh if

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,719
you know air temperature and you know

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:17,199
the surface temperature, both of which

24
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:20,118
we measure, we we know the numerator for

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,600
sensible heat. So, in a

26
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:26,000
minute I'm going to talk about how we

27
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:30,239
calculate the resistance. Now this is

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,640
much more complex in uh um conduction

29
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,879
and convection. It's complex in

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,239
transpiration too because this is to

31
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:41,118
model opening a biological phenomena.

32
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,759
But here it's it's physical phenomena

33
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,920
that determine that. So let me take a

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,759
tiny sidebar before I talk about that.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,399
Um, we've pulled up here the

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,719
Environmental Observatory on the Utah

37
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,159
State University campus. And here is a

38
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,759
live camera showing it. Um, and if we

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,840
watch this long enough, some student

40
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,640
will walk through the picture right

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,200
here. Um, this has a whole series of

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,520
graphs that demonstrate all of these

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,199
principles. It's got net radiometers,

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,719
long wave. We talked about this in a

45
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,000
previous lecture. Uh, but here's the

46
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,039
current past two days of

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,959
temperature. Yeah, there's some people

48
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,199
coming

49
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,959
by. And what's fascinating around here

50
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,598
is this blue line is

51
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,120
campus. The red line is where we're at

52
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:39,679
right now, which is the middle of the

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:42,000
valley. And the red line is Airport CSI.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
And if we tell people Campbell

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,318
Scientific, not everyone in the valley

56
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,799
knows where Campbell Scientific is. So

57
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,639
we put

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,120
airport/CFSI, but the data from CSI is

59
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,199
far superior to the airport data. So we

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,759
don't actually use the airport data. We

61
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,919
use the CSI data, but we tell them it's

62
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,679
the airport. That's why it says airport

63
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,559
CSI.

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
But this night, like so many other

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,479
nights around here, is just everything

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
the our weather because of our changes

67
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,318
in elevation in our valley are just

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
fascinating. Here's the green line,

69
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,119
which is the top of Logan Peak. And

70
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:20,000
anyone can walk outside and see this

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,840
weather station up there. We're in July.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,759
It's finally getting warmer on Logan

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,719
Peak. But look at the difference between

74
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:32,959
Campus and Campbell Scientific. And

75
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:35,680
we're at maybe 4° C colder in the middle

76
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,799
of the valley last night. And look at

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:44,239
this night. Last night we got to 9° C

78
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,120
here at Apogee and Campbell Scientific.

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:52,759
Right, which are right together. Oops.

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,519
And campus only got to 16. There was a

81
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:58,959
9° Celsius difference in temperature

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,560
last night, which is an inversion. And

83
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,120
it was colder here. An inversion would

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,920
trap the air and potentially we'd have

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
polluted air. But the sun came up and it

86
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,958
warmed it right up. And a few hours

87
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,079
later, the inversion went away. And this

88
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,238
is the summer. In the winter, these red

89
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,959
and blue lines get below the green line

90
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,519
and stay there for days at a time. But

91
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,519
this is a fascinating difference. And

92
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,159
what happens up in the top of Mount

93
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,000
Logan is it just never warms up. Here we

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,199
warm up to 30 in the day and there

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,160
they're barely warming up to 16 or 18 in

96
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,120
the day. That's just the

97
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,840
temperature. Um this shows wind speed,

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,319
barometric pressure, and then solar

99
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,000
radiation. These are nice clear days.

100
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,399
You can see this is getting to a

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,079
th00and. It looks like we looked out the

102
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,719
window. I guess there ought to be a few

103
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,000
clouds. And there's a few clouds. If you

104
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
have this, you actually don't have to

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,279
look out the window. You can just see

106
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,399
what's going on outside by looking at

107
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:03,679
the graph. Um, here clouds. Now we're at

108
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,719
1,116. There's some reflection off the

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,800
clouds. We're going above our thousand

110
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,520
watts per meter squared. This is where

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,879
it's located on the campus.

112
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,399
Um, let's let's look at a few of these

113
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,000
because they demonstrate some of these

114
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,758
principles so well.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,319
Dupoint and humidity. There's the air

116
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,120
temperature and the dupoint temperature.

117
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,759
We have dry air. So the dupoint actually

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,840
is below zero some of the time. Look at

119
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,680
this. Absolute humidity, relative

120
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,918
humidity. Absolute humidity has a few

121
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,800
fluctuations, but day and night it's

122
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,680
generally a flat line at about five or

123
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,720
six grams per cubic meter. relative

124
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,400
humidity down in the day, up at night,

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,479
down cycles because of air

126
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,638
temperature. Uh after you get these

127
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,959
principles, you just love seeing how

128
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,879
they work and interpreting the data on

129
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:03,198
this thing. All of these graphs have one

130
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,839
day and then you can call up the past

131
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,800
seven days. We're working on a new

132
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,560
revision of this that's a lot more

133
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,639
sophisticated. that that the whole

134
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,439
campus is going to a better internet um

135
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,439
uh display that will oh this will

136
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:23,759
automatically scale to fill people's

137
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:26,160
screens um much nicer um we talked about

138
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,439
barometric pressure how much that varies

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,000
let's call that

140
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,800
up this is one day this is adjusted to

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,360
sea level everybody adjusts to sea level

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,160
so we can make maps of the pressures

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,080
highs and lows Even though this is here,

144
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
it's corrected to sea level. So the

145
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,359
barometric pressure is going down. This

146
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,840
is more interesting in 7 days. These are

147
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,600
electronic barometers. So it goes up. We

148
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,638
were at a real high pressure. Now we're

149
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,720
going down over the past seven days as

150
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,598
those fronts come through. One of the

151
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,319
most interesting things about this

152
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:05,319
station is carbon dioxide

153
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,520
concentration. That's

154
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:11,319
wind. There we go.

155
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:15,038
Here's CO2 on

156
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:19,439
campus. So, we're coming along here, low

157
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:21,839
400 ppm, and a big spike here. And

158
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,000
another big spike here. Is that people

159
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,598
breathing on this sensor? People driving

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,959
their cars by the sensor?

161
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:33,519
No. This is canyon winds.

162
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,598
The canyon winds come out of the canyon

163
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,079
and they have clean air out of right out

164
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,560
of the cash national forest. The all

165
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:44,680
that photosynthesis cleans the air. And

166
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,240
look what happened here. 900 p.m. The

167
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,319
wind this is this is

168
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,560
uh the wind shifted. Right here is

169
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,960
canyon wind. 90° is coming out of the

170
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,439
canyon. That canyon wind died about 7:30

171
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:03,680
this morning and it shifted and we got a

172
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:07,038
puff of wind from downtown Logan and it

173
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,759
spiked the CO2 and we got another spike

174
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,079
here and now finally it's all the

175
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,598
valleys clearing out. We see this every

176
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:18,159
day. The canyon wind is low CO2 because

177
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,038
of photosynthesis in the summer and then

178
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,360
the canyon wind dies and the valley air

179
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:27,199
shifts up and we get a spike in

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,800
CO2 and partly that's governed by

181
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,360
photosynthesis. So here's the

182
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,120
photosynthetic photon flux that drives

183
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,120
that and then wind

184
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:43,278
speed surface temperature.

185
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,278
We talk about calculating surface

186
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,839
temperature. Most people don't realize

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,759
how different surface temperatures can

188
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,279
be than air temperatures. We're talking

189
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:56,720
about delta T right here for uh driving

190
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,919
conduction and convection. This is two

191
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,600
replicate apogee infrared sensors and

192
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:06,799
the red and green line pointing east and

193
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,278
west. Um what?

194
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,000
Pointing at what? Uh the ground surface

195
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,200
grass. Grass. Yes. This is irrigated

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,679
turf. Yep. So, let's jump back and we'll

197
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
come back to

198
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,799
this. If it should call up here in a

199
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,360
second and I can show you exactly what

200
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,359
they're pointing

201
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,200
at. Not coming up, but they're they're

202
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:36,080
pointing at the irrigated

203
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,320
turf surface temperature.

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,879
So last night, and we're going to talk

205
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,839
about this in a minute, way below air

206
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:46,080
temperature, several degrees C, below

207
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,080
air temperature. It was a clear night.

208
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,160
They're radiating to outer space, so

209
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,639
they get cold. The sun comes up and

210
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:57,879
suddenly they're warmer. And today,

211
00:09:52,639 --> 00:10:01,039
we're only getting 4° C above air

212
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:04,159
temperature, but I have seen this go as

213
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:07,199
high as 10 degrees C above air

214
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,838
temperature. the turf grass surface

215
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,040
compared to the air temperature. So, it

216
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,279
tells you how big these surface

217
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,039
temperature fluxes can be. And this is

218
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:21,600
irrigated, too. It's it's

219
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,599
uh lush and

220
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,640
irrigated. One of the comparisons that

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
we do up there

222
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:33,319
is between shields.

223
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,720
This is a graph

224
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,480
of replicate

225
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,560
matching tiny yellow bead thermisters.

226
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,000
One of them is in a traditional gill

227
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,679
shield and one of them is in an apogee

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,799
aspirated shield. So this is the last 24

229
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:53,759
hours. And you can see at night they're

230
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,719
virtually identical and there's no flux.

231
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,039
And here's the temperature differences

232
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,759
in the day. And yesterday for a little

233
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,439
bit we had 3° C difference but most of

234
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,000
the time it was down around to one

235
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,920
degree C difference. And this is a small

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,759
sensor inside that

237
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,759
shield. So we can track that. See the

238
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,039
differences. Net radiation. We already

239
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,120
talked about this. Um this is all the

240
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,599
principles and all the calculations.

241
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,278
This is intermittent clouds going on

242
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,240
right here. Here's albido of that grass

243
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,600
up there through the day. And what did

244
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,399
we say? 23 about for albidos. You know,

245
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,159
this is just a hair above two. It's

246
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,159
slightly higher in the morning and it

247
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,719
goes down slightly in the afternoon.

248
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,919
Right now it's

249
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,920
21 albido of that turf

250
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,000
grass. What else do you want to look at?

251
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,838
One of the unique features of this is a

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,480
atmospheric visibility. This is a

253
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,040
Campbell scientific sensor. Um, most of

254
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839
the time it's very clear something a

255
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,240
fleck of something got in there to for

256
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,440
these downward spikes. 32 kilometers is

257
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,120
the max. That's real clean air. This is

258
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
something that we watch a lot in the

259
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,839
winter when we have inversions. How how

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,839
low does the visibility go? And this

261
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,160
I've seen this in the worst days of

262
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,760
winter to go down here to five and 10

263
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,439
and then the inversion blows out and

264
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,639
it's clear again. It's interesting

265
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,000
because those lasers are tuned to

266
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,799
water. So, we've always been curious to

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,200
know what you end up with. Yeah. Not

268
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,078
supposed to detect a small.

269
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, this one is the reflection of

270
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,719
light. This the question is these are

271
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,958
tuned for water and would they affect

272
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,600
other things? This one's the reflection

273
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,879
of light off of particles which is

274
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,278
highly correlated with human vision.

275
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,519
So the Campbell Scientific England

276
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:55,838
people are expected to pick

277
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,278
up particles in the air, not just water

278
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,399
vapor. It's any kind of

279
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,480
particles. It's not too interesting

280
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,720
because it's summer. Here's seven days.

281
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,680
There's a few spikes. It's summer, but

282
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,320
it's pretty

283
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:13,078
constant.

284
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,519
Um temperature, thermister shield, solar

285
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,039
radiation. That's just the shortwave

286
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,519
radiation. I think we looked at that.

287
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,078
This is multiple replicate sensors on

288
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:26,200
here and they're all reading very close

289
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:28,599
to the same thing. It's comparison of

290
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,440
technologies. This also

291
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,639
shows power budget. I won't go through

292
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,880
this thing, but for people understanding

293
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,120
solar powered stations that take a lot

294
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,639
of power, it shows the energy going into

295
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
the battery and coming out of the

296
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,278
battery, the battery flux night and day.

297
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,360
This station has a lot of sensors that

298
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,360
take a lot of power. So, power

299
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,440
management's a big deal and it's full of

300
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,120
algorithms to turn stuff on and off

301
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,560
depending on power

302
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,320
availability. And this is made possible

303
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,479
by the Campbell Scientific

304
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,320
CH200 U power management system that

305
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,320
gives us a lot more data than we ever

306
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,120
used to

307
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,639
have. ET and VPD, which is what we're

308
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,278
talking about. Here's calculated. Here's

309
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,240
the vapor pressure

310
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:20,838
deficit between just the air and then

311
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,360
between the surface and the air the turf

312
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,240
surface. So we get down to less than one

313
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,278
at night and get up to four in the day

314
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,000
and then we run the penman mont equation

315
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:35,120
and here's evapor transpiration

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,360
calculated through the day um yesterday

317
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,679
and today and then a then a long

318
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,240
discussion about ET right there. Uh,

319
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,120
this shows historical data. There's

320
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,320
there's a lot of graphs on here. Here's

321
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,078
air temp oops air temperatures the last

322
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
two

323
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:59,359
years, summer, winter, summer, winter,

324
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:02,039
the min and max for each day. Uh so lots

325
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,879
of data and

326
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:09,360
and combine climate data and and

327
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:13,278
uh data that the goal is to help educate

328
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,199
the campus community for weather data.

329
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,799
And so people get interested in this.

330
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,359
And because this

331
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:23,039
has a

332
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,600
camera, you can see when somebody stands

333
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,519
there. This is a touchscreen kiosk. Now

334
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,120
in front of this which has its own set

335
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,278
of graphs and it's particularly edifying

336
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,399
to see students come and look at that

337
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,480
and study the graphs and look at the

338
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,799
sensors and it's a it's a great

339
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,159
educational opportunity to teach people

340
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:47,519
about

341
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:50,559
weather. All right, back to uh from that

342
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,278
sidebar back to sensible heat.

343
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:57,078
So the numerator is delta

344
00:15:54,278 --> 00:16:01,078
t. The

345
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:06,359
resistance is just is determined

346
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:10,078
by the thickness of a tiny layer of dead

347
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,680
air right next to all surfaces. And

348
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:17,120
everything has that. The this this board

349
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,039
has that. Our skin has that. And that

350
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,039
dead air is just like a thermal pane

351
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:27,759
window. a tiny layer that resists the

352
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,000
movement of heat. And if that layer was

353
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,399
gone

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,639
completely and the

355
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,440
resistance approached zero, things would

356
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,959
immediately equilibrate with the air.

357
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,360
But they never do immediately

358
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:45,078
equilibrate because of this little

359
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,120
resistance layer. So if we

360
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:51,479
take just the

361
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,000
resistance now this is called

362
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,240
resistance

363
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,600
BL boundary layer because it's a

364
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,399
thickness and what we're going to

365
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,880
calculate is how thick this airspace is.

366
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,240
It's on the order of millimeters. It's

367
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,679
not a thermal pane window might be 1 to

368
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,078
2 cm to to trap dead air. This is more

369
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,480
like 1 mil less than a

370
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,119
millimeter. So not

371
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,919
surprisingly this is

372
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:26,479
inversely proportional to

373
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,799
wind. That's wind speed. So there's the

374
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,200
fundamental concept. It's it's

375
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:35,839
proportional to wind. But like lots of

376
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,038
heat but heat transfer and a lot of

377
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,359
principles of wind. It's not directly

378
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,839
proportional. It's proportional to the

379
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,240
square root of wind. So if the wind

380
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,000
doubles, heat transfer doesn't double.

381
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,240
It goes up by the square root. So it's a

382
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,160
nonlinear function of

383
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,558
wind. But there's one other parameter

384
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,200
along with wind that's equally important

385
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:04,079
in here and that's in the

386
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:10,279
numerator. So if I put proportional

387
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:10,279
inversely proportional to wind, this is

388
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:19,279
width, the width of the object that the

389
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,000
wind is blowing over. And now in this

390
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,079
analysis, it's a flat object. We can do

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,720
this for cylinders and ovals and

392
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,599
different shapes. But for a flat object,

393
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,558
it's proportional to the

394
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:35,719
width. So as the width gets bigger, the

395
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:39,359
heat transfer gets less. And you can

396
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,839
imagine a pine needle would have very

397
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,959
efficient heat transfer because it's

398
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:48,240
thin and little and a banana leaf that's

399
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,400
a meter wide would have very bad very

400
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,000
poor heat transfer because of width. Now

401
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,679
same thing as

402
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,599
wind it's also proportional to the

403
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:05,038
square root of width. says these are the

404
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:07,199
two variables in this that determine the

405
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,000
heat transfer. They're both square roots

406
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,279
width and

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,279
wind because it's proportional to

408
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,918
width. Now, we look at shapes of leaves

409
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,879
and and the textbook has some examples

410
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,280
of shapes of leaves, but imagine I'm

411
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:31,039
going to put this up here.

412
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:34,440
some giant banana leaf which would have

413
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:37,240
poor heat transfer characteristics

414
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:41,038
versus some

415
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,079
leaf that might look like that. This has

416
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,038
much better heat transfer

417
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,279
characteristics. And in fact, how about

418
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:52,640
a grass leaf? I guess grass will do

419
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:54,960
grasses vertically. Grasses are thin and

420
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,400
thin grass leaves have better heat

421
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:03,519
transfer characteristics than wide dicot

422
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,160
leaves. And grasses grow more commonly

423
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:10,319
in aid places. You don't see big

424
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:13,038
tropical leaves like this in in deserts.

425
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,599
You see very thin leaves because they're

426
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,038
out of water and they they they don't

427
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,639
want to heat up. They want to be able to

428
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,640
blow the heat away.

429
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,080
So this becomes a really fascinating to

430
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,280
to think about the shapes of leaves and

431
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,439
how well they avoid getting hot. Um and

432
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,798
if they can avoid getting hot, they can

433
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,120
avoid using water too if they can uh

434
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:42,200
blow heat

435
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:47,439
away. So we have width and wind in this.

436
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:51,120
Uh the rest of this is coefficients to

437
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,240
put units on these. After we get the the

438
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:57,199
concepts, then you look up these

439
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,919
coefficients in a book. But to do this

440
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,000
to be

441
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,000
equal, now we have a coefficient right

442
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:12,038
here. Make sure I got following

443
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:14,120
my notes. I am

444
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:17,200
0.04

445
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:19,319
times and because of the rules of

446
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,400
algebra we can do

447
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:26,200
width and wind right here. So there's

448
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,640
boundary layer

449
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,640
thickness and this in these

450
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,519
units. This is boundary layers

451
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,679
thickness in meters. So it's going to be

452
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,720
a small number, a real fraction of a

453
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:53,759
meter. Width has to have units of meters

454
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,679
and wind is meters per second.

455
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,759
which are the standard units you put

456
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,600
those

457
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:04,000
in. And this has units to make this all

458
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,678
cancel to to uh get to meters here. So

459
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,159
what's this number right here? Why is

460
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,840
that

461
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:15,039
0.004? This is a coefficient that a

462
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:19,119
variable coefficient depending on

463
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:22,960
surface roughness of the object. If it's

464
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:25,639
some polished metal, it's it's a

465
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,360
different coefficient. This can

466
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:34,240
vary from over a factor of two 0.002 to

467
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:37,359
0.008 even depending on how how rough

468
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,159
the surface is. You can imagine if a

469
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,639
leaf is hairy, we call that pubescent.

470
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,960
And some leaves are really pubescent.

471
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,000
They look like they have fur on them. In

472
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,480
those leaves, this might be 0.008. 08

473
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,599
because of trapping air. Some furry

474
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,759
animal this might be 0.00 I don't know

475
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,558
how high a furry animal can get but dang

476
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:02,720
high I'm sure versus a real smooth

477
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:04,879
surface where it might be lower. So the

478
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,600
textbook uses this number and it's a

479
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,400
general number for typical leaves. It's

480
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:13,359
it's higher in hairy leaves and it's a

481
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,679
little lower in uh real smooth glossy

482
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:20,839
leaves, but for these purposes we use

483
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:24,960
0.004. Now we get a thickness of the

484
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,959
leaf in

485
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,880
meters. Let me keep going and I'll come

486
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,839
back to some filledin examples of this.

487
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,720
But we still don't have we still haven't

488
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:40,720
solved this whole thing because what we

489
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,600
want to know up here I'm going to erase

490
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,038
now let's leave light

491
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,000
insensible what we want to get to up

492
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:50,640
here is

493
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,519
watts per meter squared and so far all

494
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,880
we know is a thickness of the boundary

495
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:59,038
layer. So to put this whole thing in

496
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,679
perspective,

497
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,679
erase these

498
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:13,278
leaves, we

499
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,278
get c^2 could write this anywhere.

500
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:20,558
Um delta

501
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,079
t over boundary layer thickness in

502
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,119
meters.

503
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,158
delta t and degrees Kelvin or degrees C,

504
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:32,000
it doesn't matter. It's the same

505
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,000
number. Now we have

506
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,519
0.026 in

507
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,918
here. This is the thermal conductivity

508
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:45,200
of

509
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:48,720
air. How what's the resistance to heat

510
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,558
flow for air? So, and this has units to

511
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,440
make all the rest of this cancel. And

512
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,918
I'll give you a handout with worked out

513
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,278
units.

514
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:02,000
But if the air density was really low,

515
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,240
almost a vacuum, this number would get

516
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,400
bigger. And if it was more dense, it

517
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,359
would get higher. This this number

518
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,400
varies slightly with humidity of the air

519
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:16,879
and temperature, but not very much. It's

520
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:20,000
it's close to this number.

521
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,520
So now we can put numbers and solve

522
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,919
this. But there's one final coefficient.

523
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:30,480
Remember for net radiation, we had two

524
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,559
sides of the leaf that that long wave

525
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,679
can go up and it go down. And that's a

526
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,759
good thing because it helps leaves cool

527
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:41,120
off. If we brand these numbers for the

528
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:43,119
parking lot outside, now we don't get to

529
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,678
have two sides of a leaf because the

530
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,678
parking lot can only go up. parking lot

531
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,200
would have a big storage component

532
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,200
below. But in the case of a leaf,

533
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,240
there's two sides. Guess what? For

534
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,240
conduction and convection, two sides of

535
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,880
the leaf. So right

536
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:06,400
here, I'm I'm running out of room.

537
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,320
Two times thermal conductivity of air

538
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,880
time the delta t times the boundary

539
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:15,079
layer. And now we get watts per meter

540
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,320
squared of heat transfer from that

541
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,839
leaf. And the beauty of this is now we

542
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,319
have everything in watts per meter

543
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,038
squared. Watts per meter squared. Watts

544
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,319
per meter squared. Watts per meter

545
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:28,640
squared. And now we can look at

546
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:33,038
balancing the energy what the what the

547
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,038
leaf is doing. So I

548
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:39,278
have a

549
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:43,119
handout of this. It's It's adapted from

550
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:47,038
the book. And oh wow, we got the This is

551
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,038
up here. We're We're all

552
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:55,440
set. This the same thing I wrote on the

553
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:59,120
board. So So uh my goal is to show it

554
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,360
and then follow up with with the the

555
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:06,639
written difference for this.

556
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:08,599
Um, so this is the equation and on the

557
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,120
bottom of

558
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:16,839
this actually not the bottom it's a page

559
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,519
two this is a

560
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,240
few

561
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,798
examples I've written on

562
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,640
here just a worked out table leaf width

563
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,960
or length. Now what this really is is

564
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,440
the shortest dimension. People talk

565
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,720
about length, but a grass leaf, it's the

566
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,679
shortest dimension because it's

567
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,798
generally blown

568
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:41,880
sideways. So, here's a banana leaf 0.5

569
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:44,558
m, right? So, that's a big

570
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,640
leaf. The boundary, this table is

571
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,480
boundary layer thickness in

572
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:55,520
millimeters. A banana leaf with really

573
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,360
low wind. Wow. Almost a centimeter. I

574
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,519
mean a banana leaf is this is almost

575
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,759
like having a thermal pane window around

576
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:07,759
the banana leaf. A centimeter of 8.9 mm

577
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:10,798
is is pretty thick. So that that would

578
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:13,440
not stay in equilibrium with the air

579
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:16,158
very well at all. It it would heat up

580
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,399
and it would have to evaporate water to

581
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:23,120
balance the energy because it's so well

582
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:27,199
insulated. Now we go up this way and a

583
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,759
real thin leaf 0.002. This is meters. So

584
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,759
now this is like a pine needle up here.

585
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:36,000
And now that boundary leader is real

586
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:38,599
tiny. And we go this way and these are

587
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,960
very still air. This is meters per

588
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:44,678
second. 1 m/s

589
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,240
is down in here. Smoke would rise

590
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:52,000
vertically. And 1 meter per second is

591
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,159
well cup animometers as as you all know

592
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,159
it takes somewhere around 0.4 m/s to

593
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,960
start turning the cups on a cup an

594
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,000
animometer depends on the instrument but

595
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,000
that's this. So this is very still air.

596
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,079
Now we get up to 10 and it's really

597
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,038
breezy and all these all these numbers

598
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,720
are small. So leaves are going to always

599
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,879
be very close to the air temperature

600
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,839
when the wind is blowing because of this

601
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,840
gets tiny. So now let's look at this

602
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,919
example. Um it's just one where I've put

603
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,519
in the numbers and

604
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,480
uh and worked this out. I assumed a

605
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:36,960
delta t of two at pretty typical in the

606
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,880
middle of the day. A 5 cm width. So how

607
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,000
long is that? Three fingers. It's just

608
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,240
some average dieot leaf. Somewhat still

609
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,759
air. The wind is blowing but not very

610
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,319
fast. So now we plug in the numbers. And

611
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:53,879
there's the boundary layer thickness.

612
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:57,918
And here's the rest of it. We get

613
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,880
116 watts per meter squared transferred

614
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,038
by conduction and convection in this

615
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,000
example.

616
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:11,000
So just to take put this in perspective

617
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,359
now we we got this. I'm going to erase

618
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,359
this. I'm going to erase

619
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,359
this

620
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:27,679
this. Let's try red. Remember from a few

621
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,918
lectures ago, we put some typical

622
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,038
numbers in

623
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:34,520
here and this was from the handout. This

624
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:38,480
is

625
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,480
375 watts per meter

626
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,120
squared. We don't know this. We're we're

627
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:46,679
we're trying to solve for

628
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:49,639
this

629
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:55,600
116. So, it's pretty easy arithmetic.

630
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,600
Now, 275 265. What would this be?

631
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,200
259. I think that that um balances the

632
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:06,319
equation. So this would have to open its

633
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,840
stomates and evaporate 259 watts per

634
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,599
meter squared to balance

635
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:15,519
this. Assuming there's not storage and

636
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:17,678
all the other stuff. So example of

637
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,200
balancing this after we've put the

638
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:24,000
numbers in for uh conduction and

639
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
convection.

640
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:35,520
Now I want to show

641
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:40,159
259 is what you do backwards to get the

642
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,359
resistance and yes you now that we've

643
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:47,039
solved this and we know this has to be

644
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:49,678
this and so let me repeat the question

645
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,558
could you then use this to calculate

646
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,880
stomodel resistance or model conductance

647
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,678
and the answer is absolutely and that's

648
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,240
how we do it. We cuz we get the driving

649
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,360
gradient for this and the only variable

650
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,399
left in this whole thing is stomates and

651
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:11,319
then we the stomates had to

652
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:13,678
be this open to be able to balance the

653
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,839
energy. And then once we do that of

654
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,600
course then we make models and say in

655
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,439
this condition the stomates were like

656
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,959
this and then we try to take our models

657
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,200
and put them in and see if the whole

658
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,159
thing balances and but that's the beauty

659
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,159
of energy balance is we

660
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,799
calculate these three numbers and and

661
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,799
balance the

662
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:34,798
energy.

663
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
I

664
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:44,759
have a another handout. This is a

665
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,759
two-sided

666
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,759
handout.

667
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:51,278
Um, this is

668
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,960
entitled a six-step

669
00:32:54,278 --> 00:33:00,480
procedure to determine energy balance

670
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,720
components in a leaf. So, it's just it's

671
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,360
all in one page. Just do this this this

672
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,079
condensed incident is dependent on

673
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:13,359
shortwave. By the way, we often use the

674
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,278
Greek letter fee to mean radiation. I

675
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,079
always use a capital R, but it's the

676
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:21,200
same thing. Fe is radiation. That's

677
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,839
shortwave in plus shortwave reflected

678
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,240
plus longwave from the sky plus longwave

679
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,839
ground. Those are the four components.

680
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,480
And the sky component we measure

681
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:36,000
directly. The reflected we calculate

682
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:40,159
times the this is one minus the albido

683
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,880
of the ground. The sky I had see how

684
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,120
I've crossed this out. Well, we used to

685
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,360
calculate the

686
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:49,518
sky but now it's becoming way more

687
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,079
common to use an instrument and just

688
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,159
measure it directly because we don't

689
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,839
have to try and model the sky. And here

690
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:02,399
is an example

691
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:04,240
of a new model instrument to do this.

692
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,239
There's several companies that build

693
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,639
these. This is one more compact one. So

694
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,319
you can see this has four sensors. Two

695
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:17,280
on the top, two in the bottom. This does

696
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,240
all of these components of net

697
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,240
radiation. This sensor outputs this

698
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:26,799
number. So all in one you you get this

699
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,519
number from a single sensor. Short wave

700
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,280
in, short wave out, long wave in, long

701
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,960
wave out. This one's called a four-way

702
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,800
radiometer.

703
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,918
Um, so if these instruments are

704
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,399
accurate, wow, we've skipped a lot of

705
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:46,559
modeling to uh do

706
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:48,398
this. See how even here I have calculate

707
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,078
the ground based on ground temperature.

708
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,559
Well, now we could cross that out and we

709
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,240
could put measure. So, if you have an

710
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,719
instrument to measure it, great. If you

711
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,959
don't, you have to calculate it. So, we

712
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,959
keep going down on this. Step two. Now,

713
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,079
we do absorbed

714
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:08,480
radiation. And then we

715
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:12,000
do emitted longwave. Again, following

716
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,320
the same boom, step four, determine net

717
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
radiation. So on the first page we got

718
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,599
to to uh

719
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,679
375. It and this doesn't have any

720
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,838
example numbers. It's just a summary.

721
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:29,440
Now flip it over. Step

722
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:31,880
five is what we did previous lecture.

723
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,480
Energy transfer from

724
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,400
transpiration. Here's the equation. It's

725
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,880
either divided by resistance or times

726
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,960
conductance. Now I did an example here.

727
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,079
No, I didn't do an example. I just put

728
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,599
the equation. This I put I had to cross

729
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,760
these out because this is the latent

730
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,680
heat of evaporation

731
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,079
um right at air temperature. This is

732
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,960
this is not incorrect. It's just a more

733
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,440
detailed equation. And let me see if

734
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,440
I've got

735
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:12,559
my my uh example of that.

736
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,440
I don't I'm not sure I can find that

737
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,599
quickly. It's just a chart. Uh let me

738
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,039
let me show you what this chart looks

739
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,039
like. It's the latent heat of

740
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,039
evaporation.

741
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:46,598
So this is

742
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:50,920
uh two

743
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:53,720
I'm I'm running out of room. 2.45

744
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:58,480
45 um

745
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:58,480
megajoules per liter latent heat of

746
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:06,960
evaporation. What does this line look

747
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:09,719
like as water heats up between zero and

748
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,159
100° C? At

749
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:16,879
zero, this is

750
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:20,559
2.25 degrees all the way from freezing.

751
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,160
And at 100° C, oop, sorry, goes the

752
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,159
other way.

753
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:33,400
2.25. at 100° C and at 0°

754
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,040
C it's

755
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,889
I I don't have the exact number on here

756
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,000
but it's about 2

757
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:43,159
[Music]

758
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,079
uh

759
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:50,239
five something like 2 2.55 maybe the

760
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,880
point is latent heat of evaporation

761
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:56,078
varies very little with the initial

762
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,760
temperature of the water it varies a lot

763
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,880
with the change of state of water. So if

764
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:08,000
we connected our dots, this would be our

765
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,000
graph of the effect of water

766
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,159
temperature

767
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,160
temp on this coefficient latent heat.

768
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,358
And because our measurements are all

769
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:24,239
right in here

770
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:27,078
somewhere to to for sure they're all 2.4

771
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:31,799
4 something 2.46

772
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:34,160
2.43. So I simplified this to

773
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,800
2.45. I'm going to come back to this now

774
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,598
in just a minute with uh application at

775
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,240
night. Now we do conduction and

776
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:47,119
convection. And here's the rest of the

777
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,159
the the uh this it's just a one-page

778
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,870
summary of this whole thing with uh

779
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,039
delta

780
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:54,039
[Applause]

781
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:04,960
t. Let's take these principles

782
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:08,480
now and let me show a couple more things

783
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,119
on this before I do this. These are just

784
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,679
examples out of the

785
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,680
textbook that are

786
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:20,720
uh useful

787
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,800
examples. Here is length or diameter of

788
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,319
an object and boundary layer thickness.

789
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,079
And in millimeters, you know, I always

790
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,160
think I'm a ruler and looking at the

791
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,800
ticks on a ruler. I can I can

792
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,960
conceptualize a millimeter. Don't ask me

793
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,480
to conceptualize a micrometer. Those are

794
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,079
too small to see. But 1 to 3

795
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,719
millimeters. Now look at how this curve

796
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,720
changes with shape. A flat leaf is

797
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,959
different than a sphere and that's

798
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:48,159
different than a cylinder. So we can use

799
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,400
the same equations to model all kinds of

800
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,799
things. Cylinders and different shapes,

801
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,119
different roughnesses, but this is how

802
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,039
those shapes affect it. And then here's

803
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:03,480
just wind speed examples for um tables

804
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,480
of of examples of that.

805
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,838
Here's a good

806
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,838
example of

807
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:18,960
why width matters. Here's the wind. We

808
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,480
have laminer flow in the beginning. It

809
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,440
goes turbulent at the end. And the heat

810
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,079
transfer is better in this first section

811
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,280
than it is down here at the end. That's

812
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,640
just a illustration of that. And I'm

813
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,400
sure in a class in a heat transfer

814
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,879
class, you go over all this stuff in

815
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,599
great detail and and the all this stuff

816
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,000
is done in wind tunnels to calculate the

817
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,680
heat transfer characteristics of

818
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,079
things. So we put leaves in wind tunnels

819
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,078
to do that.

820
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,519
Now,

821
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,519
I want to

822
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:07,879
go to this little diagram here. I'm

823
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,279
going to blow this up big. It's a simple

824
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,000
diagram. Um, I got to have white

825
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,440
underneath

826
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,920
it. Make it big. I'm pretty convinced

827
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,760
that if you make everything big, it gets

828
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,960
easier to understand. And and I think

829
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,800
that's why that guy McCully he writes

830
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,800
those books and he takes how does this

831
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,680
work and he makes it big and then you

832
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,680
can understand it and I'm pretty sure if

833
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,279
you just can make the diagram big enough

834
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,679
it's like a kids book and you can

835
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,040
understand comp complex things just by

836
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:45,239
making them bigger. So here's

837
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:47,838
big here's an example out of the book

838
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:49,679
daytime net radiation and here's the

839
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,759
conditions here that we've measured with

840
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,679
our

841
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,880
instruments 370 and well coincidentally

842
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,480
we got 375 but they're they're similar

843
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,119
numbers in the day. By the way this

844
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,559
number in the

845
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:07,358
day probably goes from

846
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:10,318
300 to 500. depends on the conditions,

847
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,880
but but it it's in that general

848
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:17,759
ballpark. Obviously, if it's cloudy,

849
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:21,039
it's a lot lower. Um, and it it uh

850
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,359
depends on the surface it's over. Um,

851
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,358
but it's in the neighborhood of 300.

852
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:29,759
Okay, it has to balance. So, in this

853
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:35,199
example, the leaf here is 5° above the

854
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:38,079
air. So this is 180 and we did 116 cuz

855
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:42,439
the wind wasn't blowing very much. So

856
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:45,400
190 for uh transpiration for the

857
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,880
leaf. we can put

858
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:53,440
in water flux density four

859
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,039
millles and and it I don't know if I

860
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:01,440
want to take the time to work that out

861
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:03,599
but four mill moles of water this is a

862
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,519
transpiration rate measured of the leaf

863
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,800
now that's that would have to be

864
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:15,559
measured to get this

865
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:21,560
times 18 water is 18 gram per

866
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:23,799
mole 18 g. So 40

867
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:29,159
64

868
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:32,920
mg of water. 40 It's more than that.

869
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:35,519
72 40 + 32 72

870
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:39,800
mg per meter. Everything's per meter

871
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:43,400
squared per second of water. Now

872
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:46,880
times 2.45

873
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,160
45. And this is

874
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,200
um a

875
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:55,559
milligram. We're going to have to scale

876
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:58,439
this way down. Is a

877
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:01,559
um let's see, a

878
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,679
milliliter, literous

879
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:08,000
thousands. It's not a mill. It's a

880
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:08,000
microl of

881
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,359
water. So now we have 2.4 45 and I'm

882
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,679
going to do

883
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:17,679
KJ per

884
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:26,960
milliliter or to to get the

885
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,559
microL let's get rid of the kila and and

886
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,920
let's this is going to become

887
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,318
microL. So the latent heat of

888
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,880
evaporation conversion of units 2.45 45

889
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:41,759
jewels per microL of water. This is that

890
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,240
measured transpiration rate. Now what do

891
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,760
we get here for

892
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:49,919
jewels? Um

893
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,960
140. Anybody want to do the math? It's

894
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,720
going to be

895
00:44:51,960 --> 00:45:00,519
about

896
00:44:53,719 --> 00:45:00,519
190 jewels per meter squared per second.

897
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,079
probably may be exactly 190. So we just

898
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,200
did an example of taking a transpiration

899
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,720
rate in moles of water converting it to

900
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:18,000
weight of water multiplying by latent

901
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,598
heat of evaporation to get this number.

902
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,599
I haven't it's good thing that worked

903
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:26,480
out. I thought of doing that right now.

904
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:30,880
Okay, this is typical if the plant is

905
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,039
well watered. This can get to 370 and

906
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,280
this one can go to zero. And when that

907
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:40,079
happens, the leaf is at the exact same

908
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,400
temperature as the air. As the plant

909
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,200
runs out of water, this has to get

910
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,079
bigger until if the transpiration went

911
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,598
to zero, this would have to roughly

912
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:55,359
double and the leaf temperature might be

913
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,920
10° C, the leaf to air delta T, to make

914
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,159
the energy balance.

915
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,240
A little bit more radiation is lost if

916
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,799
the leaf gets hot, but not much. So, you

917
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,519
can see how these numbers go back and

918
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,359
forth constantly with depending on how

919
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,920
watered the well watered the plant is.

920
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,559
And this is why if we put infrared

921
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,400
sensors on this to get leaf temperature,

922
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,119
we can tell the water status of the

923
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,920
plant. We can tell how how out of water

924
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:25,920
the plant is. Now, here's the next big

925
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,599
thing. Radiation frost. taking these

926
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,079
things at

927
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:34,640
night. Here's the moon. He didn't he

928
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,160
didn't get the sun anatomically correct,

929
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,358
but

930
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:42,358
um we could fix that. And right here, I

931
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:45,318
don't really want to draw on the board,

932
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:47,920
but there.

933
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:51,279
Now, you got to be happy when the sun's

934
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,760
out. So, here's the moon at night. Well,

935
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,040
guess what? This net radiation goes to

936
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,640
zero.

937
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:01,599
and the sky is cold. So on a clear

938
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:05,920
night, net radiation is always a

939
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:09,200
negative number. It assuming the ground

940
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,000
is colder than the very cold sky. It's

941
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,719
always a negative number. Energy still

942
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,280
has to

943
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:19,358
balance. So now these numbers that were

944
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,680
going out of the leaf in the day are

945
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:26,440
coming in to make the energy balance.

946
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:29,759
This one's easy. It cools off below air

947
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,800
temperature, so it's gaining some heat.

948
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,160
Everything reverses itself at night.

949
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,480
What's going on here? A negative

950
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:41,519
number. In this case, C is

951
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,400
transpiration. I'm not sure why I use

952
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,480
the symbol C, but this is

953
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,559
transpiration. It's a negative number. L

954
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:53,440
is transpiration. Oh, thank you. Thank

955
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:56,000
you, Mark. Yep. So L is latent heat and

956
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,800
C is conduction and convection. So

957
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,400
here's a negative

958
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:03,400
number. What's going on here? It's

959
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,240
evaporating water. It's

960
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,800
cooling. It could go to zero if the

961
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,799
stomates are shut. How'd this go

962
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,318
negative?

963
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,280
Condensation frost. This was a cold

964
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:22,759
night. it it the air temperature was +

965
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:26,480
one the leaf cooled to

966
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:29,359
minus1 and the it water condensed on it

967
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,119
and it was below zero so it became frost

968
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:35,078
and this is exactly what makes frost

969
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:40,440
form. So what happens here

970
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:44,640
is the leaf gains heat

971
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,519
by change of state in water. And I have

972
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,078
a

973
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:52,480
handout right

974
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,440
here. This is such a this is a whole

975
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,838
page

976
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,920
handout. But

977
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:02,838
again to make it big or to make it easy,

978
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,559
it's big.

979
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:08,960
So here we

980
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:10,640
go. Change of state of water. Once you

981
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,800
get this, you have it forever. But it's

982
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,838
it's it's counterintuitive to people

983
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,599
when you first think about

984
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:20,318
it. Heating up water really doesn't take

985
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:23,480
all that much energy. It's the energy is

986
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:28,159
in change of state of the water.

987
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,760
So the energy required mega per kilogram

988
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:35,358
to heat water from 0 to

989
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,040
100 is 042. No change of state or

990
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,159
there's a big change of temperature but

991
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,400
no change of

992
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:44,078
state to

993
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,559
evaporate to here let's do the liquid to

994
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:50,119
gas to evaporate it here after it's at

995
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:54,079
100° 2.25

996
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:56,800
25 mega per kilogram to evaporate it. So

997
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,039
it takes more energy to evaporate the

998
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,519
water than it did to heat it from 0 to

999
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,960
100. A lot more. What's that? Five times

1000
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:08,199
as much to to evaporate the water. So

1001
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,039
the big cooling is when the water

1002
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:16,199
evaporates.

1003
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:19,679
Um here now I can fix my graph at

1004
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:22,919
zero. No, this is 100. Nope, I got it

1005
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:27,000
right. At 100°, it's

1006
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:29,760
2.25 to evaporate the

1007
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,639
water. So now we go the other way. Same

1008
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,640
thing happens with ice. Now it's going

1009
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,318
change a state from a solid to a liquid

1010
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:41,039
back and forth. Ice, it also takes more

1011
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:43,599
energy to freeze the water than it

1012
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:47,039
almost as much to freeze it as it did to

1013
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:49,280
cool it from 100 to zero. So every time

1014
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,800
I do when I saw this many years ago and

1015
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,200
I'm thinking about it and I think about

1016
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,519
every time now I have a fridge

1017
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,279
automatically makes ice but you build

1018
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,039
you put ice in your ice cubes and you

1019
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,920
put them in the fridge and you're

1020
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,599
waiting and waiting and they're cold but

1021
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,358
they're not freezing and then and then

1022
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,838
you wait and you wait and bam they all

1023
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,558
freeze at once and that's because this

1024
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:14,318
this went fast and that final thing took

1025
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:16,400
forever to change the state of the ice

1026
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,039
cubes. In fact, speaking of that,

1027
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,400
there's a famous

1028
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,239
question. I've never actually done this

1029
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,960
experiment. And if you make ice cubes

1030
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,838
out of hot water and cold water and put

1031
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,720
them in your fridge, which one freezes

1032
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,799
first?

1033
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:36,799
That's what you would expect. I've done

1034
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,839
this test myself. And and what which one

1035
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,839
freezes first? Cold.

1036
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,799
There's a continent of energy to pull

1037
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:46,400
water. That's right.

1038
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,440
Intuitively, the cold water is a lot

1039
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,039
closer to starting. But what can happen?

1040
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,639
This is the little trick in this

1041
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:57,199
question. You put that hot water in

1042
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:59,920
there and it can evaporate like crazy.

1043
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:01,919
You put a inch or a couple centimeters

1044
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,559
thick ice cube and the hot water in the

1045
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,880
process of cooling loses energy like

1046
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,720
crazy. So now your ice cube is only a/4

1047
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,280
of an inch thick and you only have to

1048
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,279
freeze a quarter of an inch. So

1049
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,519
supposedly you can make ice with hot

1050
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,880
water and it'll freeze faster, but you

1051
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,599
won't get much of an ice cube because

1052
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,960
all the water evaporated. It was all all

1053
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:25,119
the energy is going here. Um, but the

1054
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,519
goal is to have a big ice cube. So you

1055
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,519
always start with cold water, but

1056
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,079
there's the there's the principles back

1057
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:38,639
and forth. And the bottom of this has

1058
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:41,039
the the uh this by the way this when it

1059
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,759
goes this way this is called the latent

1060
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:46,558
heat of condensation and this is latent

1061
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,559
heat of evaporation. So we get deon

1062
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,400
leaves heats them up that goes back and

1063
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,960
forth.

1064
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:58,119
Now we can go

1065
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,039
from this

1066
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:03,640
to one

1067
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:07,880
table in the book that

1068
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,879
I'll go over

1069
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:14,639
um just a bit quickly here, but it's

1070
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,640
this is the same diagram that I just

1071
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:22,318
showed you big. Um this is page 332

1072
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:25,440
figure 710. It's he Nobel works out four

1073
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,960
examples with inputs and outputs from

1074
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,039
leaves. Here's his assumptions down

1075
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,800
here. It's his first one sea level

1076
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:37,119
cloudless day 840 coming in. So this

1077
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,920
isn't quite a thousand. It's not quite

1078
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:43,358
full sunlight but he ends up with net

1079
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,838
radiation of 370 which he uses up here.

1080
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,880
and he's got the components of all the

1081
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,599
things in and out on here. Then he goes

1082
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,920
to 2,000

1083
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:59,079
m. So now the incoming radiation is a

1084
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,079
bit more. The sky is slightly

1085
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:04,519
colder. The end up net radiation's the

1086
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,920
same. Here's the key leaf

1087
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:10,079
temperature. This is plus five, but at

1088
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,159
2,000 mters, the leaf temperature is a

1089
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,960
little bit colder. the sky is a little

1090
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:17,838
bit colder and the leaf is a little bit

1091
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:19,599
colder. Then he does and you can these

1092
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:22,358
will lead to thousands of interesting

1093
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:25,318
test questions. Then he does a silvery

1094
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:28,639
leaf where the

1095
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:32,000
emissivity and absorptivity emissivity

1096
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:35,159
changes and the albido changes because

1097
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,519
of a silvery leaf. And all of a

1098
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:42,399
sudden, this is on a 2,000 meters

1099
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:44,639
um 10 degrees and the leaf still heats

1100
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,800
up three above the air temperature, but

1101
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,000
the heating is less because the leaf is

1102
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,519
a different color, different more

1103
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,559
silvery. And then the last two are

1104
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,800
really interesting. Sea level, cloudy

1105
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,200
night. So now it's all zeros here

1106
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,359
because it's night. Temperature here is

1107
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,919
one. This is example you worked out up

1108
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,519
here.

1109
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:10,960
Um, when there is

1110
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:14,000
wind, the leaf still fro a light wind,

1111
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,920
the leaf still froze minus one. But then

1112
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,358
he works out an example right under it

1113
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,240
with no wind or minimal wind and the

1114
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:24,199
leaf went to

1115
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:27,279
minus9 below the air

1116
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:31,558
temperature. And that is the definition

1117
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:35,680
of a radiation frost which I put right

1118
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:39,400
here. When a surface goes below the air

1119
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:43,039
temperature and below

1120
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:45,119
freezing it that's it frost forms on it

1121
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,039
and it happens all the time on clear

1122
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,760
nights because they get below the air

1123
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,838
temperature there's condensation and the

1124
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,520
condensation freezes and that's what

1125
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:56,880
frost is. And if it happens all night

1126
00:55:53,519 --> 00:56:00,079
long, the frost can get enormously long.

1127
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,880
Um, but it's all because of this radiant

1128
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,400
cooling at

1129
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:09,400
night. This is so

1130
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,400
profound that

1131
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:26,318
This is I'm going to pick this up in the

1132
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,079
second half of this, but I'm going to

1133
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:32,960
introduce it here. This is so profound

1134
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:36,200
that fruit growers in the spring have to

1135
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,639
be continuously worried about radiation

1136
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:41,598
frost. In the past, they've just looked

1137
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,199
at air temperature and in one night they

1138
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,280
can lose a million dollars worth of

1139
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,759
fruit because their young flowers get

1140
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,480
cold and they freeze and they they're

1141
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,640
done. their yield is done for the year.

1142
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,639
They cannot afford to

1143
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:59,759
just do frost protection based on air

1144
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:02,719
temperature. They have to do it based on

1145
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,440
surface temperature of the uh and

1146
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,759
particular in their case of the flower

1147
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,159
buds.

1148
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,520
So you can buy an instrument that's a

1149
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:17,039
black flat plate that simulates a leaf

1150
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:19,440
at night and put it out and that flat

1151
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,798
plate gets colder than the air and

1152
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:26,318
attach a sensor to it. Um and that and

1153
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:29,679
then also a single black sensor that in

1154
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:31,279
a sensor give a grower a sense of the

1155
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,679
radiation frost from a direct

1156
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,680
measurement as opposed to calculating it

1157
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,639
with all the other parameters of a

1158
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,279
weather station. Fruit crops in Utah are

1159
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,960
a much

1160
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,359
bigger agricultural sector than most

1161
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,679
people realize. We're Michigan and Utah

1162
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:50,558
are the two top producers in the nation

1163
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:53,358
for tart cherries. Um, it's a

1164
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,200
multi-million dollar industry and it's

1165
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:58,480
all concentrated here in the northern

1166
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,639
part of Utah. So, in recent years, we've

1167
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:05,119
done a lot to help fruit growers tell

1168
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:07,759
when to protect against radiation frost.

1169
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,838
So, I'm going to stop here with this

1170
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:14,559
section, especially since I made it to

1171
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:16,838
my end of my list, and we'll after

1172
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,480
break, we'll pick this up

1173
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:23,358
and talk about

1174
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:27,039
the applications of radiation frost and

1175
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:31,039
uh summarize all of the lectures with

1176
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:33,920
examples of this. So, and I and I think

1177
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,920
we have some sandwiches.
