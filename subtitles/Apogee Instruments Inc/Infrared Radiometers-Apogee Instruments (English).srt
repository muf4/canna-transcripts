00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:12,009
Apogee Instruments Infrared Radiometer are excellent for measuring surface

2
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,839
temperatures in applications that require extreme accuracy and zero

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,179
interference to the target. Scientists use them in many ways such as: monitoring

4
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:24,618
plant canopy temperatures, to detect water stress;  taking road surface readings

5
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:28,338
in harsh climates; measuring water and snow temperatures in hydrological

6
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:33,310
studies; spot checking solar panel temperatures, to ensure efficiency; and

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,670
more. When it comes to precision and durability, Apogee sets the standard. Each

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,719
infrared radiometer has an industry-leading uncertainty of 0.2 degrees celsius at a

9
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,340
range of -30 to 65 celsius with aa response time of less than one second. To

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,379
eliminate water vapor errors the sensors unique germanium window, matches the

11
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:58,599
8 to 14 micron atmosphere window and any emissivity errors are eliminated by

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,670
applying a correction formula when measuring background temperature. Finally, each

13
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,920
sensor is housed in a sealed aluminum body to provide years of reliable

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,159
service in any environment, with a radiation shield to protect from rapid

15
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,789
temperature changes.  As the final step of production each unit is custom

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,500
calibrated and quality checked, using a state of the art temperature chamber

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,680
that puts each sensor through a fifteen hour performance cycle before it leaves the

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,240
factory. For added flexibility, Apogee features models with various

19
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,030
half angles field of view,

20
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:38,040
including 14 degrees, 18 degrees, 22 degrees, and our wide format, 32 by 30

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,650
degree model, for measuring surfaces at shallower angles. To maximize

22
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,590
compatibility with dataloggers each model is available in both an analogue

23
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,799
version, with a microvolt output, and a digital SDI-12 model, for

24
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,728
instantaneous readings. All sensors are available with an integrated handheld

25
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:00,009
meter. Tor more information about Apogee's line of infrared radiometers,
