00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,638
A high quality silicon-cell pyranometer can be a cost effective alternative to a

2
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,539
thermopile sensor for measuring solar radiation. Apogee pyranometers are

3
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:26,460
widely used in agriculture and solar energy applications. In clear sky conditions

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,349
Apogee pyranometers compare favorably to secondary standard reference pyranometers,

5
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:39,869
but at a fraction of the cost. In 1996 we introduced a silicon-cell pyrometer

6
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:45,399
that provided a low-cost alternative to more expensive sensors.

7
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,009
Through continuous innovation and improvements to the design our pyranometers

8
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:56,988
are now known for quality and durability. As an industry leader Apogee's

9
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:00,119
pyranometes have been included on systems from some of the biggest

10
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,459
names in environmental monitoring, such as Campbell Scientific, Columbia

11
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,109
Weather Systems, Torro, Rain Bird, and many more.

12
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:13,879
Why did these top companies trust Apogee? As a research-driven company Apogee has

13
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,679
carefully refined our pyranometer design and manufacturing processes. All

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,590
of our pyrometer are built at our headquarters in Logan, Utah. Each

15
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,460
sensor body is milled from high quality aluminum, and is then coupled with

16
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,849
custom optics and precision electronics by our skilled technicians in carefully

17
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:35,188
controlled conditions. As a final step all pyranometers are thoroughly

18
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,489
inspected and tested to ensure their quality and accuracy before we ship them

19
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:44,640
to you. Apogee pyranometers feature a dome shaped head that

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,228
allows it to quickly shed water, dust, and other debris. Pyranometers with a

21
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,679
flat or even recessed top, can trap rainfall and debris, which block the optical

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
path. Our self-cleaning design allows you to collect accurate data without

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,759
worrying about keeping it clean. Apogee pyranometers are filled with a resin to

24
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,799
create a barrier against water and humidity. Hollow pyranometers

25
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,090
can have significant errors if water gets inside. With our design

26
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,650
moisture is completely taken out of the equation. Accuracy is a key property of

27
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,050
any sensor. Under clear sky conditions Apogee pyranometers have a calibration

28
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,880
uncertainly of plus or minus five percent when compared to a reference thermopile

29
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,049
pyranometer. A key pyranometer characteristic is cosine response or

30
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,840
the relative error as a function of solar zenith angle. Apogee has achieved

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,520
excellent cosine correction through optimization of the diffuser material

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,360
and shape. Testing by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden,

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,020
Colorado has shown that Apogee pyranometers are comparable to the best

34
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,450
thermopile pyranometer on the market.

35
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:58,709
A sensor is only as good as its calibration. To ensure accuracy each

36
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,790
pyranometer is calibrated in tightly controlled laboratory conditions

37
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,949
traceable to ISO reference standards. To maintain traceability to the world

38
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,849
radiometric reference, every spring we send our reference pyranometers to the National

39
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:18,299
Renewable Energy Laboratory for pre-calibration. Finally each Apogee sensor

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,130
is calibrated with a standard output to make them interchangeable in the field.

41
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:26,650
Apogee features a full line of parameters to fit our customers needs

42
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,830
our sensors come with standard pigtail lead for easy integration with most

43
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:36,180
dataloggers. Models include our flagship SP-110, which is a basic self-powered sensor

44
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,700
with a full-scale output of  200 mV. For customers needing an even

45
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:47,738
larger signal we offer three amplified models: the SP-212 with 0 to 2.5 V output, the SP-215

46
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:56,170
with 0 to 5 V output, and the SP-214 with a 4 to 20 mA output. To improve year-round accuracy we

47
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,780
developed the SP-230 all season pyranometer, which has a raised stand and a tiny 0.18 watt internal heater that

48
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:09,719
keeps the sensor clear of dew, frost, and snow. For mobile measurements Apogee offers two

49
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,909
pyranoeter options that includes a handheld meter with a digital display.

50
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,859
The MP-100

51
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,889
features an integrated sensor in the top of the meter, while the MP-200

52
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,399
features a separate sensor connected with two meters of cable.

53
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:27,029
Custom lead lengths are available on request. The handheld meter displays instantaneous

54
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,259
readings or can be set in logging mode that can store up to 99 individual

55
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,339
measurements. For OEMs and system integrators Apogee offers customizable

56
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,219
options such as different multipliers, output, cable length, and a variety of

57
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,700
pre-installed connectors. With Apogee you're dealing directly with the

58
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,829
manufacturer, and we can work with you to provide pyranometers to fit your

59
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:53,379
specific need, no matter how big or small. For more information on our line
