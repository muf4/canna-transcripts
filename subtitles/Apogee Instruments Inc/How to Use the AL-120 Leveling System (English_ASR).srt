00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,080
hello and welcome to this video brought

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,878
to you by Apogee instruments my name is

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,798
Nick hold and I'm an engineer here at

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:09,058
Apogee and today I'm here to talk to you

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,179
about one of our most recently released

6
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,919
products the AL 120 and the AL 120 was

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,350
brought about to replace our old

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,868
leveling system consisting of the

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,210
mounting bracket MV leveling plate sold

10
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,070
as two separate items and the mounting

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,650
bracket consisted of a Swiss cheese

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,868
array of holes only six of which were

13
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,768
used for actual mounting

14
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:30,990
additionally the leveling plate

15
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,969
consisted of a combination of six screws

16
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,009
three being used for mounting and three

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,270
being used for leveling a very very

18
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,619
tedious tedious system and based off of

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,570
feedback that we've received over the

20
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,849
years we have immensely simplified this

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,200
design to consist of three holes for

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,410
mounting and a fixed wave spring as a

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,239
pivot point for easy leveling today I'm

24
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,148
going to talk to you about how to

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,558
assemble your AL 120 and how to mount it

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,160
to your weather station or your cross

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,649
arm so to begin for best practices we

28
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,688
encourage that you mount your sensor to

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,670
your leveling plate prior to assembling

30
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:13,379
your bracket and prior to mounting it to

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,840
your weather station however if you need

32
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,849
to remove your sensor for calibration or

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,670
for any other purpose you can always do

34
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,728
so by unscrewing two black nylon screw

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,490
through the bottom of your bracket so to

36
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:28,769
begin using the three hole pattern on

37
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,959
your leveling plate match it up with a

38
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:34,170
three hole pattern on your leveling

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,989
bracket fitting the wave spring into the

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,930
groove on the back of the Loveline plate

41
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:42,449
take your hex cap screws and fit them

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,829
through your leveling plate and begin to

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,460
thread them into your bracket once you

44
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:53,519
have loosely finger tighten these grab

45
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,039
your u-bolt and place it through the

46
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,199
Vblock on the bottom of your bracket and

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,770
begin installing the hardware beginning

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:07,579
with your washers followed by your lock

49
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:10,579
washers and then followed by your bronze

50
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,579
nuts

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,040
so once you've installed all this

52
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:20,810
hardware tighten down your bronze nuts

53
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,659
approximately to where your your cross

54
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,330
arm will fit between the u-bolt and the

55
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:30,490
V block then you can slide this right on

56
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:34,370
to your cross arm and finger tighten

57
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,189
your hardware until it fits loosely on

58
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,430
your cross arm and approximately

59
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:43,280
parallel to the ground then take a half

60
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,610
inch crescent wrench and further tighten

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,780
this down so that it fits firmly and

62
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:57,110
snugly to your cross arm after a few

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:03:00,139
turns should have it in place and there

64
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,970
you have it so now our al 120 is mounted

65
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,579
on a horizontal cross arm

66
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:07,129
additionally we do have a vertical

67
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,140
configuration all you need to do to

68
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,780
change it from horizontal to vertical is

69
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:14,750
remove the screw that holds the plastic

70
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,189
Vblock to the bracket and move it to

71
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:22,219
this back side using screwing in the

72
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:24,859
screws from the inside inner side of the

73
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:27,379
bracket now once you place that on you

74
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,810
follow the same steps to place in your

75
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:33,590
u-bolt in your hardware and mount it to

76
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,930
your vertical cross arm this has been a

77
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,830
video a tutorial of how to assemble your

78
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,510
AL 120 for any questions or concerns

79
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,980
