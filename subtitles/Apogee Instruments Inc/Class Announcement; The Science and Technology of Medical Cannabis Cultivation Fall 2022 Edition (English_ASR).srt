00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,679
I'm Bruce bugbee professor of crop

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,679
physiology here at Utah State University

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:15,178
and I'm thrilled today to be announcing

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,039
the fall 2022 edition of our well-known

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,480
course in

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,359
medical cannabis cultivation

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,640
we started with 54 lectures in the first

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,039
edition and we're going to build on that

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,439
in this new edition with about 40

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,739
additional lectures in this course

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,780
that's going to mean breeding you

12
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:38,839
lectures on plant breeding expanded

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,500
insects and diseases

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,540
cannabinoid extraction medical cannabis

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,840
we're thrilled to bringing you this

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,960
course I'm joined in this effort by Dr

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,160
Royal Hines a long-term colleague and

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,439
also Mitchell Westmoreland who is we are

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,198
the primary instructors and we're joined

20
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,939
by several other people helping us in

21
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,179
specialty areas

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,759
let me very quickly show you what we're

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,520
going to talking about nine Cardinal

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,280
parameters form the basis of cultivation

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,158
four in the root zone five in the shoot

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,219
Zone we especially focus on nutrients

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,560
water light as the light goes up the

28
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,560
water goes up everything it interacts

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,740
with everything else this is complex but

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,840
exciting in its complexity

31
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,419
we're not only going to give you

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,700
lectures in the principles and the

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,460
theory we're going to take you to our

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,978
greenhouses and our growth Chambers and

35
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,559
show you the research we're doing we're

36
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:45,719
actively conducting research on cannabis

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,460
cultivation and as we make new

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,500
discoveries we're going to share them

39
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,199
with you and we're going to show you how

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,420
we collect the data we have over 44

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,320
growth Chambers here at Utah State

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,040
University to do this kind of research

43
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:05,218
at the end of the course you can take an

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,500
exam and on successful completion of the

45
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:10,919
exam you'll get a certificate of

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,680
completion assigned by all of us uh

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,139
that's been a great thing for students

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,900
I might add that the tuition money that

49
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:21,958
you pay goes to support graduate

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,300
education doesn't pay my salary doesn't

51
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,959
pay for anything else it just supports

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,120
our graduate education in our research

53
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,459
we're excited to have you in the class

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,459
and we look forward to getting started
