00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,799
I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee instruments. Today I'd like to talk about

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,990
chlorophyll meters especially the non-destructive chlorophyll meters

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,850
that are vary widely used by a number of people. We'll go through a little bit of

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,029
the history of it how they work and then the advances that have been made over

5
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:29,380
the years. So in the 1980s Minolta came out with this

6
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:36,429
meter it was made by the scientific products analysis division at Minolta

7
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:41,488
a they use their acronym, they call it a SPAD meter. Sometime people

8
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,250
begun to think S.P.A.D. is synonymous with chlorophyll and it is not it's an

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,250
acronym for a company. That was the first meter. Then some years later Optisciences

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,090
came out with this meter.

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,960
It has some advantages over the Minolta meter, little bigger area to

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,978
average leaves and then recently Apogee instruments came out with this meter

13
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:11,289
which has some fundamental advances over the other types of research-grade meters

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,750
for chlorophyll. So let's take a look at what those differences are. The first

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:25,349
thing is if we draw a leaf it's full of cells and these cells are full of

16
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:36,839
chlorophyll. If we shine a light on this leaf and we put a detector down here we

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,509
can get the transmitted light through the leaf. This is pretty easy to do and

18
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,978
it gets us the amount of cellulose in the leaf and the amount of chlorophyll

19
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:53,158
in the leaf, both together. The chlorophyll is in here in little packets

20
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,149
inside these cells so to really be able to measure this we take another

21
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:06,189
wavelength of light and another detector down here

22
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:14,219
and this is red light and this is near infrared light (NIR). These are all on the

23
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:21,639
apogee website, the details of these. And now by subtraction we can get at the amount of

24
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:29,359
chlorophyll in this leaf. And it's the electrical output of these two detectors.

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:45,050
When we make a graph of this difference and we put transmission down here, the

26
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,000
ratio of these wavelengths and we put chlorophyll up here. And I'm going to

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,750
abbreviate that just CHL for chlorophyll. This would be lovely if we got a nice

28
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,560
straight line and the transmission was directly related to chlorophyll we would

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,129
have a meter that told us chlorophyll. Unfortunately the distribution of

30
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:16,259
chlorophyll in a leaf is so clumped up that the light goes in many directions.

31
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,129
It doesn't come straight through the leaf and when we make this graph

32
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:28,359
it's highly nonlinear. That's a fundamental characteristic of all of

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,739
these optical meters to get this non-linear relationship between

34
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:42,709
transmission and chlorophyll. So here, let me show you what happens with this, if we

35
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:55,509
put tick marks in this graph now and we have 12345, we make a measurement here

36
00:03:55,509 --> 00:04:02,139
and we have that much chlorophyll, let's call that about one. now we make another

37
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:07,479
measurement out here at five,

38
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:15,229
and you would think the chlorophyll went up by a factor of two and a half and in

39
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:23,389
fact it doesn't. This only doubles so the transmission is not a direct

40
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:29,949
indicator of the chlorophyll in the leaf. This has led to lots of problems.

41
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,699
People write papers and they say "the SPAD number went from two to four

42
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,970
therefore my chlorophyll doubled." And that is wrong, the chlorophyll did not

43
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:47,120
double. This index doubled, so the SPAD Minolta meter that reads in SPAD units

44
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,129
only gives an index that's non-linearly related to chlorophyll. The Optisciences

45
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:01,589
meter also gives an index that's non-linearly related to chlorophyll. And

46
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:07,459
because of these problems and because of the need to really measure chlorophyll

47
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:17,009
Apogee instruments built on the research that developed characteristic lines like

48
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:23,810
this for each species of plant. There's one line for wheat, there's another line

49
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:30,560
for corn, there's a line for rice, they all take the same basic shape they just

50
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,189
have slightly different curvatures. With this equation you can convert transmission

51
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:47,459
into actual chlorophyll in the leaf and the result is a graph where we

52
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,459
have chlorophyll here,

53
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:58,219
actual chlorophyll measured by extracting the chlorophyll, and this unit

54
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:07,139
down here is now optical chlorophyll, or

55
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:15,829
optical CHL, and the relationship is a straight line. So we can very

56
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:21,098
accurately measure chlorophyll in the leaf with the appropriate software in

57
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:26,878
the meter to convert this family of curved lines into straight

58
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,819
lines. That's the beauty of the apogee meter in terms of what it does to get

59
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,749
chlorophyll. This took a lot of work, a lot of measurements of chlorophyll and

60
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:44,889
non-destructive chlorophyll. We have a video that shows the techniques to do

61
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:52,278
that. There's a family of curves in there for twenty two species and it's growing.

62
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:57,408
We're getting a curve in there for potatoes and other species now so we can

63
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:03,949
establish this linear relationship between what the optical meter measures

64
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:10,020
and the true chlorophyll in the leaf. So in a nutshell that's the advance in this,

65
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,990
and it's a sufficiently big advance that Apogee patented this meter, it has a

66
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:22,838
patent pending on this meter. It now allows researchers to get measurements

67
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:27,158
of chlorophyll without having to kill the leaf, without having to

68
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:32,810
extract a leaf and measure it in a spectrophotometer. So thanks for

69
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,240
listening. That's a nutshell of the advances in these measurements over the

70
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,038
last thirty years.
