1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,029
hello my name is Ben Crabbe I do

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:04,679
technical sales and support here at

3
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:06,719
Apogee instruments I'm here to talk

4
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,570
about our new micro cache Bluetooth

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,550
logger this is a little Bluetooth

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,219
enabled battery-powered device that

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,839
connects with your smartphone and

8
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:18,570
interfaces with any of our unamplified

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,460
analog sensors any of our sensors that

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,268
put out a little millivolt signal this

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,849
micro cache can log and so I'll just

12
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,768
briefly go over some of the features and

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,618
specs of the micro cache and then I'll

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,869
show off with the phone how to connect

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:37,049
it and some of its some of its

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,669
measurement capabilities so here's a

17
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,828
picture of it and an idea of the

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,670
dimensions there is a little four to 20

19
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:48,989
threaded hole in the back for mounting

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,929
so you can mount it to any of our

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,669
mounting brackets by default most of our

22
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,750
sensors come with this little cable it's

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,260
about 12 feet 12 inches long 1 foot long

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,390
30 centimeters and so that makes a nice

25
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,069
compact unit we also have for our par

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,159
censors we've got a 2 meter cable length

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:14,069
option for measurement underwater or for

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:16,259
corals let's see this app or this micro

29
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,478
cache connects with your phone with a

30
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,060
little smartphone app called Apogee

31
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,310
connect you can find it on the Apple App

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,180
Store or the Google Play Store just

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,790
search for it here is an overview of the

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,570
specs I'll point out a couple of the

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,240
major ones the IP rating is ip67 this

36
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,279
means that it is rugged for outdoor use

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,658
I've got a couple on the roof for the

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,519
apogee building and they've been snowed

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,780
on it's the end of January now they've

40
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,228
been up there for months and they're

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,090
doing fine let's see the weight is only

42
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,950
52 grams so this would be great for

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,250
mounting on a drone if you wanted to fly

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,719
it around and take aerial measurements

45
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,540
the data storage capacity is almost half

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,739
a million data points and the battery

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,840
life ought to be long one or two years

48
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,839
based on this 10 second sampling

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,340
interval or 60 second sampling interval

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,229
with an average of five minutes of daily

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,098
connected time that battery life will be

52
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,420
dependent on

53
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,768
amount of time that you're connected

54
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,828
with your phone the Bluetooth

55
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:21,480
communication requires more power than

56
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:23,010
just the logging let's see the last

57
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,560
thing on this so I'll point out is the

58
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:28,858
ADC the analog to digital converter

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,378
resolution this is 24 bits so that's 2

60
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:33,510
raise of the 24th power a number of

61
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:36,568
intervals across the two and a half volt

62
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:38,158
measurement range which is negative one

63
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:40,679
and a quarter volt one and a quarter

64
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,780
volt and so that's very fine resolution

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,879
measurements you can distinguish very

66
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,930
fine changes in the voltage value from

67
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:51,209
the sensors oh one more thing I'll point

68
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,650
out a 2/3 double-a is what it runs on so

69
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,688
there's a little unusual battery size

70
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,639
but you can find it online and battery

71
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:58,408
stores it's not too hard to find and it

72
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,829
just looks like a double-a battery but

73
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:04,438
it's a little bit a little bit shorter

74
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:06,810
so it is a great solution for spot

75
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:09,328
measurements we're talking about the in

76
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,549
particular the par application now spot

77
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,409
spot measurements logging ppfd values

78
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,810
this is photosynthetic photon flux

79
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:17,668
density that value that's expressed in

80
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,519
units of micro moles per meter squared

81
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:23,840
per second of light within the 400 to

82
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,969
700 nanometer wavelength for plants and

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,219
calculating D Li and photo periods D Li

84
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:31,169
is the daily light integral this is just

85
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,959
the the summation of all those ppfd

86
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,909
values over the course of a day and the

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,039
photo period is how many hours over the

88
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:39,598
last 24 has the light been above a

89
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,298
threshold and you can set a custom

90
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:46,128
threshold in here by default it chooses

91
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,129
half a micro mall which is quite dark

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,389
and then these two graphics just show

93
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,000
the concept of D Li across the across

94
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,549
the country per month so this is just

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,859
from from Sun but of course if you're

96
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,519
growing indoors electric lights will

97
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,650
also contribute to your D Li situation

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,438
and on the right this is a document that

99
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,810
you can link to on our website it came

100
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,418
through the univer to University's

101
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,729
Extension Office and it highlights the

102
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,069
the DOI values for a whole lot of

103
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,689
different species so with our device

104
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:20,290
with this might with this micro cache

105
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,050
logger you can

106
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,390
precisely measure your light levels for

107
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,400
optimum the optimum level for your

108
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:31,659
plants and the optimum photo period for

109
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:35,289
your plants okay here's an overview of

110
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,990
the screens in the app just briefly the

111
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,610
overview screen gives you a look at all

112
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,000
this all the micro caches you've been

113
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,680
connected to and so you can you can be

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,350
connected to as many micro caches as you

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,550
have with the app in this screenshot

116
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,990
just one of them is connected and you

117
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,840
can see it's got a value of eighteen

118
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,250
point four micromoles per meter squared

119
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,019
per second the other ones aren't

120
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,529
connected but if they were you'd also

121
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:02,500
see live readings from those the logging

122
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:05,829
setup screen you get to this by clicking

123
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,810
on a little gear icon this will allow

124
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:11,589
you to set up your logging and family

125
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,420
sampling intervals and the fastest

126
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:14,829
sampling you can do is one second

127
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,199
sampling of course that'll drain your

128
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:19,810
battery a little faster in this case

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,849
looks like we have it set to 10-second

130
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,040
sampling in one minute logging in this

131
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,350
screenshot one minute logging is still

132
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,120
quite fast you could log every 10

133
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,620
minutes or 15 minutes still get a real

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,769
good idea of your light levels through

135
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,980
the course of the day let's see this

136
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:38,469
live meter display you can go to live

137
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,569
meter mode and then this graph will

138
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,150
update every second with new values as

139
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:45,129
you you can walk around and put it under

140
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:47,829
this light under that light and and be

141
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:49,810
able to see precisely the light levels

142
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:51,339
on this mode you can also do a manual

143
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,740
data collection so there's a button a

144
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,939
little lower on this screenshot where

145
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,310
you can push the button and it'll time

146
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,529
stamp give a date and time in your micro

147
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:03,639
molar value and those will be there the

148
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:05,529
next time you open the app as well then

149
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,019
over here on the far right side of the

150
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:12,189
screen this is after you've downloaded

151
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:13,599
log data you can take a look at what's

152
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,819
been going on over the course of the

153
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,870
previous days or weeks that you haven't

154
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:21,730
been attending to your sensor perhaps

155
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,709
and in this case I've pulled a fast one

156
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,050
a little bit this graph is not just from

157
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,479
an SQ 500 which is what this blue-headed

158
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,000
sensor is but this one's from a new

159
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,430
sensor that we have the par 4 sensor so

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,560
this has two diodes one measures the

161
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,009
and the other diode measures far red

162
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,629
light which is also important for plant

163
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,909
photosynthesis and morphology or shape

164
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:48,250
and so on this graph you can see there's

165
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:49,960
there's the green curves each day that

166
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,600
is the par level and then the far red

167
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:55,839
light is is expressed with the red line

168
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,100
and those are smaller values but anyway

169
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,909
you can get both values from this new

170
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,980
par forest sensor on the far right

171
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,930
screengrab you see the daily light

172
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,759
integral and so this is the value I was

173
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,160
talking about previously that's just the

174
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,139
summation of all those ppfd values over

175
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,840
the course of the day it's expressed in

176
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:16,839
moles per meter squared per day and then

177
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,579
you can also see your photo period which

178
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,039
is a number of hours over whatever dark

179
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,139
threshold you've set and so those are

180
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,330
the kind of summaries you can get from

181
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:28,060
collecting log data off of your par

182
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:32,079
sensor with the micro cache or from your

183
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,120
par far sensor with your micro cache I

184
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,879
think I mentioned this before but we do

185
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,889
have two cable links the approximately

186
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,870
one foot or 30 centimeter length which

187
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,879
is the default length from for all of

188
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,459
our sensors before it gets to that

189
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,829
little connector but for coral

190
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:50,019
enthusiasts or underwater users we do

191
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,399
have a two meter cable length that you

192
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,500
can order and I could just give you a

193
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,279
little bit more leeway to put the sensor

194
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,350
down in the water

195
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,059
I wouldn't go dunk in the micro cache in

196
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,800
water but it'd probably be fine for a

197
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,280
brief dunk but I wouldn't put it down

198
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,259
under for long and then this just shows

199
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,329
how it connects to our brackets it's got

200
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,849
that quarter twenty threaded hole in the

201
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,560
back and so it's it's pretty easy to

202
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,420
mount it's got some grooves on here you

203
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,709
could use zip ties to connect it to

204
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:19,060
things oh and then our web page our

205
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,489
product web page you can go to our web

206
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,379
site Apogee instruments comm you click

207
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,329
on products up here and you'll be able

208
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,490
to quickly see micro cache Bluetooth

209
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:30,219
logger and you get to this webpage and

210
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,070
there's more information and and and

211
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,710
things you can see and there's the URL

212
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,470
for you I think that's the end of the

213
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:44,340
slides that I have and so now I'll

214
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:47,070
switch over to HDMI to

215
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:53,670
get this phone connected so we can show

216
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:57,260
off the the sensor or the functionality

217
00:08:53,669 --> 00:09:06,088
of the app let's see screen mirroring

218
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:08,549
here we go okay Apogee connect is this

219
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,880
app with the logo kind of looks like a

220
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:14,879
planet green colored and so we click on

221
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,159
that here's the Apogee connect kind of

222
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,269
general screen so on this phone there's

223
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,860
been a lot of sensors have been

224
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,960
connected in the past a lot of different

225
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,909
micro caches each micro cache is

226
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,350
uniquely identified by its serial number

227
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,639
here in this screen that makes it a

228
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,470
little easier to know which one you're

229
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,110
connected to the one I've got here is

230
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,110
surround lumber ten ten eighty five and

231
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,629
I don't think that's connected yet and

232
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,240
so to connect we just push the big green

233
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:42,028
button on here for two seconds or so

234
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,379
three seconds and this little LED will

235
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:45,330
start flashing that means it's

236
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:48,659
advertising now we click on this plus

237
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:50,430
button up here to add a new device it

238
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,338
searches for the device it quickly finds

239
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:55,289
it's called micro cache 1085 this is the

240
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,790
default name it gets at the factory so

241
00:09:55,289 --> 00:10:04,049
you just tap on that and it gets

242
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:06,000
connected in this case this SQ 500 is

243
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,099
the correct sensor but if it wasn't you

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,990
could just click on choose model and you

245
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,089
can scroll through and choose the model

246
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,460
that you want I'll hit cancel because it

247
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,680
was correct you could enter a custom

248
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,300
calibration but of course this one just

249
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,949
has a standard factory calibration so

250
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:21,569
we'll leave it alone but if you wanted

251
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,310
to you could enter a new calibration

252
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,010
number then in there to multiply your

253
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:29,069
millivolt value and get a a calibrated

254
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,689
value so we'll just we could rename it

255
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,360
here or whatever we want but we'll just

256
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,160
leave it micro cached n85 for now now

257
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,279
this thing that we just added should be

258
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,139
at the bottom of the list here it is

259
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,019
with the current micro mold reading so

260
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,958
tap on that and now we get to kind of

261
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:49,829
the more well this the micro cache

262
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,569
specific display and we get a we get an

263
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,310
instantaneous update of the make of the

264
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,040
micro molar volume if we cover this

265
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:57,219
sensor up should drop to zero a little

266
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,849
bit of noise around zero

267
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,959
but that's what it's at and if we

268
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,278
uncovered it comes back to that

269
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:08,619
approximately 5 micro more value in here

270
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,688
let's see I will show off let's see the

271
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,419
loot the live meter Mon let's click on

272
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:15,610
that and this will give a graph it's

273
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,559
updated every second and so right now

274
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,100
it's just gonna Bop around approximately

275
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:25,028
5 micro moles if we were to cover this

276
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:28,420
up I'll drop down to zero uncover it

277
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:31,120
will go back to approximately 5 we would

278
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:34,120
have pointed at the lights in here it'll

279
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,679
go up a little bit if we were to get it

280
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,480
closer to lights it'll go up even more

281
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,809
and if we were outside in the Sun of

282
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,550
course it would be much higher than what

283
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,500
we're seeing in him here but you can see

284
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:50,799
they can get instantaneous live meter

285
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,629
mode graphical results right there if

286
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,688
you click on View data there's your data

287
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:58,569
every second for what we've been doing

288
00:11:54,688 --> 00:12:01,240
let's go back down here these are the

289
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:02,740
manual data collection values I'll clear

290
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,370
this table it must have been from before

291
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,068
but if we hit record current value you

292
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,620
get a timestamp date/time micromo value

293
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:14,229
and so you can walk around and take

294
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:18,188
values by clicking this record current

295
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,740
value button and the next time you open

296
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:24,549
the app those will still be in there you

297
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,470
can you can export the data well you can

298
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:29,049
look at the data and then you click this

299
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,110
little sharing icon up in the top right

300
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:35,409
and you can select the app you want to

301
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,199
email it to yourself or send it to your

302
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:40,600
computer in some other way

303
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:44,078
and I'll give you a CSV VAT a CSV file

304
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,600
oh I think it's a semicolon separated

305
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,568
file but a tabular data file that you

306
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:54,699
can use okay so that's the light meter

307
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:57,669
mode let's see I think we already went

308
00:12:54,698 --> 00:13:00,278
over settings I went over it on the on

309
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:02,049
the static screenshot but here's the

310
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:04,509
settings you can adjust logging and

311
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:07,178
sampling intervals you could turn

312
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:08,889
logging on and off if it's on its using

313
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:10,659
up the battery so if you want to save

314
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:13,120
your battery just make sure you turn log

315
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:16,179
off in the settings even if you unscrew

316
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,100
this even if you unscrew this the micro

317
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:20,859
cash is still logging it's just logging

318
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,569
noise it's not logging anything good and

319
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,430
so it'll eventually eat up its battery

320
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,409
so you want to turn logging off if

321
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,099
you're gonna store this for an extended

322
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,659
period of time

323
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,480
to reconnect it there's a little notch

324
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:33,850
on this and so you just kind of well you

325
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,490
just kind of twist it until it falls

326
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,290
into place and then you you know finger

327
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,129
tighten it you don't have to tighten it

328
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:45,039
too much and then it's good to go

329
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:46,629
okay what else water correction you turn

330
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,278
this on when you take measurements under

331
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,379
water the light kind of bounces off the

332
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:52,120
sensor and so the scent more than it

333
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,399
does in the air and so the sensor reads

334
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,379
inaccurately low but we've characterized

335
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,448
that on this model it reads thirty-two

336
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:00,100
percent low and so if you put this

337
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,929
correction on here it'll boost the

338
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,759
values back up to the correct values for

339
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:06,758
underwater measurements but we're not

340
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,289
doing that so I'll leave that off some

341
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,180
other settings in here including this

342
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:12,909
dark threshold that'll help define the

343
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:14,559
photo period down at the bottom you get

344
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:16,719
some information about the serial number

345
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,258
of your micro cache and the hardware and

346
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,500
firmware versions and the current time

347
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,879
your time on the micro cache over the

348
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,278
course of weeks and months might be off

349
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,828
by a couple seconds and so you can

350
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,568
always go match current time in this

351
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:35,138
case I think I matched it very recently

352
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:38,588
so it's still very accurate let's see

353
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:40,600
now let's show you how to collect some

354
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,430
logs currently there's just two logs

355
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,778
available for connect collection so it

356
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:46,629
was about 20 minutes ago my last

357
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:50,049
collected that logs off this device but

358
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:52,179
we could do that and so we'll just

359
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,948
create a new data set it's called new

360
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,469
data set for it's not going to be very

361
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:58,479
interesting but we'll hit collect logs

362
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,829
boom we got them I don't even know if

363
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,829
they display if there's only two of them

364
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:07,539
but more interesting more interestingly

365
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,399
if there were more than two in there

366
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,948
we'd see a graph but let's go collect

367
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,100
logs will get create new and now it'll

368
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:17,019
be new data set five and what you can do

369
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,350
I know this one has been logging data

370
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,659
for about since early December and so on

371
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,759
this start time

372
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,740
going to hit start time and I'm gonna

373
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,309
kind of roll back the clock by about

374
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,950
four days to January 26th and I'm gonna

375
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:33,209
set that as my start time here's my end

376
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,730
time right now

377
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,310
January 30th from the late afternoon so

378
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,289
I hit collect logs oh there's my two

379
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,699
data points they finally showed up it's

380
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,860
very exciting data set

381
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,900
regardless here's our new logs coming in

382
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,940
there were about 500 of them and now

383
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,769
they're all collected and now our

384
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,350
display updates now we're looking at new

385
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,909
data set five if we wanted to go back we

386
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,980
could hit switch data set and we could

387
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:58,049
look at new data set four which was our

388
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,420
boring data set of two data points we

389
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:02,159
don't want that we'll switch back to new

390
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,919
data set five which we just collected

391
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,469
which is these four days of data and you

392
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,079
can see that there's a diurnal pattern

393
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,460
as the as the lights come on the Sun

394
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,560
comes up and then everything's dark at

395
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,480
night in this case we had an electric

396
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,969
light this was sitting in a window

397
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,100
inside but there was an electric light

398
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,690
on it that was on a timer and so at

399
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,759
night the electric light went off and

400
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,080
the day it was on and then the Sun came

401
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,370
up and so on and I guess I guess the

402
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,650
electric light must not have been on

403
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:35,009
this day in this day no it wasn't

404
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:36,659
I remember we disconnected it but anyway

405
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:38,819
you can view this data you can click on

406
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:42,449
View data and you'll see each timestamp

407
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,480
date/time micromo value over the every

408
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:48,120
10 minutes so 10:30 p.m. 10:40 p.m. and

409
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,610
so on and so on over the course of time

410
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,830
that you had data collected and if you

411
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,980
grab this thing on the side and scroll

412
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,720
all the way to the bottom here's the

413
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:05,789
most recent one that was collected at

414
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:08,360
4:20 today next graph on this log data

415
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:11,159
summary is the daily light integral

416
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:14,729
again this is the the summary of all the

417
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,040
PFD values over a 24-hour period and you

418
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,529
can see that it was inside so we didn't

419
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,480
get real high moles per day but it was

420
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,819
around 3 and a half this day and around

421
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,829
2 Mol's on those days and you can hit

422
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,179
view data and you can see that and if

423
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,679
you wanted to share it you can click on

424
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,410
that share button up in the up in the

425
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,600
top right corner again and finally we

426
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,100
got the photo period now this is a

427
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,409
little fishy because there's

428
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:40,769
here three bars here that are all around

429
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,990
24 hours per day and we saw that it was

430
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,210
dark on these on these graphs it looks

431
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,220
like it's it's dark at night well I

432
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,079
think there was a little light on over

433
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,390
the course of the night that they kept

434
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,250
the micro more values at around 3:00

435
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,240
where usually they would go down to zero

436
00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:00,329
so what we can do is we hit this setting

437
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,669
gear click on that we go back down to

438
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,710
our dark threshold I'm gonna put in a

439
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:06,809
value of five this is kind of an

440
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:10,890
unusually big value but just to show off

441
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:13,349
this photo period of capability if you

442
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,620
set the the dark threshold to five now

443
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:19,168
this at this photo period summary

444
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,668
updates rather than 24 hours a day now

445
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:24,270
it says it's around 12 hours a day

446
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:27,600
which makes more sense in line with our

447
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:30,679
our graph here let's see what else do we

448
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:34,558
have we got through settings live meter

449
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,960
switching data sets I think I think

450
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:41,569
that's about all of the major

451
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,569
functionalities of the micro kashish

452
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,870
again this little device will interface

453
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:51,480
with a single Apogee sensor any of our

454
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:54,869
unamplified analog sensors that produce

455
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,490
little millivolt outputs it's small it's

456
00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:01,019
rugged and and weatherproof and we hope

457
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,259
that a lot of people find a lot of use

458
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:08,269
out of this so thank you very much for

459
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,269
watching and see you next time

460
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,509
you
