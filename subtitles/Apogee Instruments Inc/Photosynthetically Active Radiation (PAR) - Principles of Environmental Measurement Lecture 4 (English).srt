1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,650
I'm going to talk about quantum sensors or sometimes we call them PAR sensors,

2
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:32,729
photosynthetically active radiation sensors. They look the same as pyranometres, but instead

3
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,909
of being designed to measure all of the shortwave wavelengths from the Sun or an

4
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,619
electric light they only measure the photosynthetically active wavelengths

5
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:50,070
that is typically defined as 400 to 700 nanometers. The same wavelengths that the

6
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,770
human eye sees are the same wavelengths that drive photosynthesis in plants.

7
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,809
It's an often-used measurement in plant research because it tells us how much

8
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,128
radiation is available or how many photons are available to make

9
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,650
photosynthesis happen. There is multiple radiation sources available

10
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,228
used to grow plants. I'm showing some here sun, lots of different electric

11
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:25,769
lights. Nowadays LEDs (light emitting diodes) are becoming more and

12
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,969
more common. This is actually a photograph taken from Bruce's lab at

13
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,078
Utah State University and they've got all these little growth chambers each

14
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,389
one with a different colored LED or a different combination of colored LEDs in

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,430
them to see what kind of effects different color treatments have on plant

16
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:52,020
growth and plant morphology. We keep pressing the wrong button. LEDs

17
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,500
are becoming more and more common all the time especially in research

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,459
applications. LEDs are often narrowband meaning they only output a narrow range

19
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,629
of wavelengths, whereas, radiation sources like the Sun or some of these electric

20
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,719
lights are broadband; they output a lot of radiation across the

21
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,590
photosynthetically active range. The main point that I want to make here

22
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,740
is that accurate photosynthetically active radiation or PAR

23
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,540
measurements are required for a host of applications especially if we're

24
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:32,109
interested in photosynthesis. Before we start talking about the sensors

25
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,000
here's just a few definitions you probably have heard these terms before

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,039
and seen them to find but it always helps to review a little bit. I

27
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,129
already mentioned that photosynthetically active radiation is

28
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:52,090
the radiation that drives photosynthesis. Photon flux density is just a number of

29
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,150
photons that flow through a unit area per unit time. We're just counting

30
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,849
photons basically, and so either count the micro moles of photons per meter

31
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,859
squared per second, that's an instantaneous unit that we use, or we

32
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,500
count the moles of photons per meter squared per day on a daily

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,560
timescale. That's how we characterize the flux of photons. The photosynthetic

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,219
photon flux density (PPFD) is just the photon flux density integrated over our

35
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:32,680
photosynthetically active range, 400 to 700 nanometer wavelength range.

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,650
When we have a quantum sensor or a PAR sensor, one of these guys, this is the

37
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,409
number that it's measuring right here. They put out this unit so it

38
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:49,780
measures the micro moles of photons per meter squared per second. Basically

39
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,000
the incident photons on the detector, and then when we integrate that number over

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,019
a whole day we get the moles of photons per meter squared per day. Yield

41
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:08,890
photon flux density is kind of like the photosynthetic photon flux density but

42
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:13,899
instead of just integrating over the 400 to 700 nanometer range, to get yield

43
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:22,120
photon flux we actually weight the photon flux by the plant response to photons and

44
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,769
then we sum it up. This one will become a lot more clear on my next slide

45
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,918
because will show you a graph that illustrates the difference between this

46
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:36,279
one and this one. A quantum sensor is this thing; it's just the instrument

47
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:42,069
that we use to measure PPFD. The reason that we often call them quantum

48
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:49,240
sensors is because one photon is a single quantum of radiation, but quantum

49
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,280
sensor can be kind of a confusing term I think. Nowadays you often hear them

50
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,209
called PAR sensors because they are measuring photosynthetically active

51
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:05,079
radiation. PAR sensor and quantum sensor mean the exact same thing.

52
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:11,948
Here's the the graph that I mentioned when I was describing the difference

53
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:19,560
between photosynthetic photon flux and yield photon flux. Wavelength on the

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,589
x-axis and then just relative quantum yield or the response to photons on the

55
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:33,579
y-axis . The green line is actually measured data from a number of different

56
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:39,819
places, I listed some of the publications here. Keith McCree at Texas A&amp;M

57
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,769
University was the first to do this back in the early 70's and then others

58
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:51,990
followed up and found similar similar data. What he did is he took a leaf and

59
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,819
he measured the the photosynthetic response or basically how much carbon

60
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:04,269
did that leaf uptake at each wavelength of light. He used a light with

61
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:08,889
specific filters over the top of it to give him really narrow wavelength ranges

62
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,060
and he just measured the carbon uptake of single leaves as a function of

63
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,720
wavelength. He found that the photosynthetic response actually looked

64
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,660
like the green line. The plant leaves respond a little bit more to blue

65
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,070
radiations than they do green radiation and they're most sensitive or most

66
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:33,019
responses to the red radiation. The data that McCree and others

67
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:36,799
measured for single leaves we have to remember that it was it was in the

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,199
laboratory, it was plants grown under controlled conditions in many cases I

69
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,150
think they also measured field plants, it was a low light environment, and again it

70
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:55,089
was single leaves.A more useful and universal definition of

71
00:06:55,089 --> 00:07:00,500
photosynthetically active radiation is rather than trying to weight measurements

72
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,740
of PAR by this green line we just assume that all the photons between 400 and 700

73
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,889
nanometers are equally efficient at making photosynthesis happen in plant

74
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:20,930
leaves. The universally accepted definition of PAR is what we call this

75
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,038
defined plant photosynthetic response, where we just get equal weight to all

76
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:31,310
the photons within the 400 to 700 range and we don't give any weight to photons

77
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,098
outside the 400 to 700 nanometer range. We use that as our definition of

78
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:43,750
photosynthetically active radiation. PAR sensors, these kind of devices,

79
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:50,060
should have a spectral response or a sensitivity but matches this black line

80
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,689
as close as they can.

81
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:04,159
There are really a couple of options for for measuring PAR. One is to use a

82
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:10,019
quantum sensor like this and it's a broadband device meaning it gives you a

83
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:16,228
single signal, one number. An analog device means it would output voltage

84
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:23,310
that represents the sum of all of the radiation that's incident on this

85
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,860
detector and again it should be the sum of all of the radiation between 400 and

86
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,700
700 nanometers. That number (that voltage) that it outputs is weighted by the

87
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,610
spectral sensitivity of the sensor itself. You have a filter and

88
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,528
the purpose of the filter in front of the photon detector is to try to give us

89
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:52,049
the best match that we can to 400 to 700 nanometers and then we have a single

90
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:57,208
detector that gives us an output that should be proportional to PAR. The

91
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:02,009
spectral response of the sensor is dependent on the transmission of the

92
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:08,669
filter and the sensitivity of the underlying detector. Alternatively rather

93
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:12,719
than using a quantum sensor for PAR measurement, we could use a spectroradiometer.

94
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,310
These are hyper spectraldevices, meaning we're getting signals at

95
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:22,919
multiple wavelengths. You can actually  get spectroradiometers that give you a

96
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,219
measurement at every single nanometer within the 400 to 700 nanometer range

97
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,528
that would be quite fine resolution. Oftentimes, they give you a

98
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:38,879
measurement at every 5 nanometers for example. The point is you're actually

99
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,500
getting a measurement at multiple positions across the wavelength range of

100
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,799
interest. A quantum sensor only gives you PAR. A spectroradiometer gives

101
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,469
you both PAR and the spectrum. Not only do you get photosynthetically

102
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,370
active radiation but you get the shape of the spectrum. In some applications,

103
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,089
that might be useful.

104
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:10,438
Here the detector array determines the spectral response.

105
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:16,618
A spectroradiometer is in practice it's a relatively simple device. You have a

106
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:21,059
prism or maybe a diffraction grattng, where the light enters the unit and that

107
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:25,438
prism or diffraction grating is actually separating the light into the individual

108
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:29,998
wavelengths. Then somewhere behind that that prism you have a whole array

109
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:34,439
of detectors that measures the intensity of the individual wavelengths, so we get

110
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:40,708
multiple signals. It looks like a relatively simple device on paper but in

111
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:45,988
practice they can be quite complicated. The only thing that really

112
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:50,149
determines the spectral response or the sensitivity of a spectroradiometer is

113
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:56,458
how well is it calibrated. If we can accurately calibrate each of the

114
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,568
wavelengths, then we have an accurate quantum sensor independent of the light

115
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:03,948
source that we're trying to measure.

116
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:12,209
There's lots of different options for for quantum sensors. Here I'm showing you

117
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,710
some of the more common commercially available quantum sensors, and how well

118
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,110
their spectral sensitivity or their response to photons matches our

119
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,480
definition of photosynthetic radiation. The black line is what we're trying

120
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,220
to match because that's our definition of the photosynthetic photons. Then

121
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:39,000
the colored lines, the blue and red lines, are the actual sensitivities of

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,899
some of the different sensors that are available on the market.

123
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:48,120
Kipp and Zonen has a sensor, Sky Instruments has a sensor, Licor has a

124
00:11:48,120 --> 00:12:01,230
couple the model LI-190 has now been replaced by a newer model from Licor called the LI-190R.

125
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:08,700
At Apogee we build a couple different models the SQ-110 is the one

126
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,480
that we've sold for years and it's still available, and the SQ-500 is a new model

127
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:23,039
that is a better match to the photosynthetic photon flux weighting

128
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:30,360
factors. Having this information, we can actually now make estimates of what

129
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,250
kind of errors we can expect when we use these sensors for different light

130
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,019
sources, meaning Bruce talked a little bit about how the solar spectrum can

131
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,850
change for clear versus cloudy conditions so if we calibrate these

132
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,409
sensors in clear conditions for example and we know that none of

133
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:54,629
them have a perfect match to our definition of photosynthesis we can

134
00:12:54,629 --> 00:13:00,629
expect some some errors when we try to use them in cloudy conditions. For

135
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,799
example, if they were calibrated in the laboratory under an electric light what

136
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,399
happens when we try to use them for measurements under a different electric

137
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,730
light or what happens when we take them out of the laboratory and try to use

138
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,039
them for measurements in sunlight. All we have to know, we need three pieces of

139
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,469
information basically to estimate spectral errors. That is we

140
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,399
need to know the spectral response of the sensor we have that information here,

141
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,379
we need to know the spectral output of the radiation source that was used to

142
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,700
calibrate the sensor, and then we need to know the spectral output of the

143
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,520
radiation source that we're trying to measure. To better illustrate that,

144
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,289
let's just take an example. You can see here's the spectral response of the

145
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:50,419
Apogee model SQ-110. This is the traditional Apogee quantum sensor that's

146
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:54,829
been available for for several years. You can see that it's not a great match

147
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:01,600
to our our definition of photosynthetic radiation that we measure some of the UV,

148
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,670
it's not as sensitive to the blue as it needs to be, and it misses some of this

149
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:12,740
red radiation out here when we get close to 700. This mismatch between the

150
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,980
actual sensor response to photons and our definition of photosynthetic radiation

151
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,529
is going to cause spectral errors. Kind of an extreme example: let's say we

152
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:32,299
are measuring an LED that was a blue and red mix where the red peak was like 660

153
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:38,359
or 670 nanometers you can see there's a lot of output from this led that's

154
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,120
beyond the sensitivity range of the sensor that means the sensor is not

155
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,419
going to count those photons because it's not sensitive to them and it will

156
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:53,179
cause spectral error. There's a equation we can use to actually

157
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,959
calculate spectral errors and as I mentioned previously the only bits of

158
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,269
information that we need this s is the spectral sensitivity of the sensor in

159
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:10,309
this example would be the blue line, the I calibration is the spectral output of

160
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,649
the light source we use to calibrate the sensor it could be the Sun it could be

161
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:19,909
an electric light, and then this I measurement is the spectral output of

162
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:24,909
the lamp that we're trying to measure it might be this led for example.

163
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:33,309
What I'm about to show you is error calculations using this equation for all

164
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:42,009
six of these quantum sensors that I have spectral information for right here.

165
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:50,830
The table shows data where we use sunlight on a clear day as

166
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:56,320
the calibration source and so all of them have zero error under sunlight and

167
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,370
you can see what kind of errors they have for a whole bunch of other light

168
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:06,700
sources. We've got sun spectrum on a cloudy day, a Sun spectrum that's

169
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,700
reflected from a grass canopy. You can actually in addition to measuring

170
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,820
incoming radiation you know some applications you might want to invert

171
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,930
the quantum sensor like this and measure reflected radiation from the plant

172
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:24,099
canopy. If you have a measurement of incoming radiation and a measurement of

173
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,690
reflected radiation, it tells you how much of the photosynthetic radiation is

174
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,550
being absorbed by the plants at the surface. Bruce just mentioned in

175
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:39,789
the previous talk that if this were a silicon-cell pyrometer you can't invert

176
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:44,379
it like that and make measurements of the surface because there's large

177
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,519
spectral errors that are associated with doing that and he showed a table of some

178
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,870
of those errors. Using a quantum sensor, however, one of these PAR sensors that's

179
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,139
designed to measure photosynthetic radiation instead of the solar radiation

180
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:02,439
you can take it and invert it like this and these numbers here reflected from

181
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,170
glass gives you an idea of what kind of error you can expect when you invert a

182
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,789
quantum sensor. Oftentimes, I'm going to talk about this particular

183
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:16,990
application in a little bit more detail in a minute, we want to put quantum

184
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,769
sensors underneath plant canopies and measure how much of the photosynthetic

185
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:24,879
radiation is transmitted through the plant canopy. Here's the kind of

186
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,870
errors you can expect if you measure underneath plant canopies. This is data

187
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:37,418
for a wheat canopy. I think I failed to mention that all of

188
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:45,429
the numbers that you see here are percentages so not actual radiation units,

189
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:49,870
so not micro moles per meter squared per second but percentages. Then we have a

190
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:56,109
whole list of of electric lights that people might use in a greenhouse or a

191
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:02,589
growth chamber environment. A couple things that you can see by

192
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:08,859
looking at the data in this table is that all of them work quite well for

193
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:17,069
most of the radiation sources on there except for the Apogee model SQ-110.

194
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:25,659
Some of these LEDs you can see the errors get pretty large that's because

195
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,769
of the data I showed you on the previous table it doesn't have an excellent match

196
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:35,099
to the photosynthetic definition or the definition of photosynthetic radiation.

197
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:40,599
You want to be careful using quantum sensors for certain radiation

198
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,649
sources. You want to make sure that they are going to capture the photons that

199
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:53,230
you're trying to capture. You'll notice of the other sensors some of

200
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:59,910
the worst errors also tend to be LEDs. Here's a 3.8 % and

201
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,820
3.6 % that's an LED. A 3.0 % over there that's an LED.

202
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:10,178
LEDs are tricky to measure so for those of you that are working in greenhouses

203
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:17,679
and measuring LEDs sometimes the best option for that might be a spectroradiiometer.

204
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,419
As I mentioned when I was talking about the differences

205
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:25,780
between quantum sensors and spectroradiometers if you're

206
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:30,039
spectroradiometer is calibrated accurately because it's measuring all

207
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:35,769
the wavelengths individually then spectral error doesn't exist. We don't

208
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,658
have to worry about spectral error with the spectroradiometer.

209
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,940
The main difference, so you might be asking well if this is the case why

210
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,210
would I ever use a quantum sensor to measure PAR wouldn't I just use a

211
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,399
spectroradiometer every time? The difference is the price tag. Quantum

212
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:57,488
sensors tend to be in the low hundreds to maybe the mid hundreds in terms of cost.

213
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:01,909
Spectroradiometers tend to be an order of magnitude higher. They're in the

214
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:07,159
thousands, the low thousands to maybe even the mid to higher thousands.

215
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,229
That is the real difference. Quantum sensors are often the measurement of choice because

216
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:19,249
they give you accuracy that's good enough for the application, and they're

217
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:27,019
much lower cost. This is just a brief comparison of everything we've

218
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:32,239
covered up to this point quantum sensors are subject to spectral error, spectroradiometers

219
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:36,379
are not if they're calibrated accurately. Quantum sensors

220
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:40,819
give you a broadband measurement meaning one number or one signal that's

221
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:46,009
proportional to PAR so you can only get PAR from a quantum sensor. A spectroradiometer

222
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,759
not only do you get PAR, you get the spectrum if the spectrum is

223
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:58,069
required. Then I just talked about the differences in price. A couple

224
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:01,788
more review points there's lots of commercial quantum sensors available and

225
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:07,929
I showed a least six of them and their spectral errors and many of them have

226
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,809
minimal errors less than 5 % when measuring lots of different light

227
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:21,440
sources. Then remember PAR is almost universally reported as photosynthetic

228
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,820
photon flux density and units of micro moles per meter squared per second, but

229
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,778
it can be converted to other units if the spectrum is known.

230
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:34,548
The reason that I put this point up here is often we get people that contact

231
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:40,398
us that they need measurements in units of watts per meter squared or even units

232
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:44,778
of lumens per meter squared (lux) on occasion. These units aren't often

233
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:48,798
used in environmental applications and plant science but on occasion that they

234
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,648
are you can convert PPFD measurements from a quantum sensor to

235
00:21:54,648 --> 00:22:03,558
other units if you know the spectrum. It's possible to do that. Bruce showed a

236
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,108
table like this for Apogee pyranometers here's similar information for Apogee

237
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,539
quantum sensors just some specifications to give you an idea of the performance.

238
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:19,489
The directional response or the cosine response for a quantum sensor is

239
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:25,358
very, very similar to the cosine response from pyranometer. The temperature response

240
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:32,449
is also similar. The stability is a little bit better for the quantum

241
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,319
sensors that we tested and the calibration uncertainty is listed there.

242
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,580
Let's skip over that summary slide just because we've pretty much discussed

243
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,849
everything already. I mentioned i wanted to talk about a specific

244
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:52,199
application, intercepted radiation. I want to show you something really quick

245
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,990
before we go through the slides I thought it was interesting. This is a

246
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:03,059
little brochure from Western Sydney University that I picked up yesterday

247
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:09,980
here in the Hawkesbury Institute. There's a part I'll blow it up on the

248
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,329
document camera so you can see it.

249
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,558
Here we go.

250
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:42,028
This is actually a picture and a short caption from the brochure

251
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:46,278
that I found here at the institute yesterday. It says this

252
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,788
photosynthetically active radiation sensor measures light intensity below

253
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:55,769
the canopy. These are combined with sensors above the canopy to estimate how

254
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:01,769
much shading is occurring, which correlates to the amount of leaf area.

255
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:09,989
One application of these power measurements is above canopy and below

256
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:15,808
canopy measurements to try to estimate how much radiation is being absorbed by

257
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:21,028
the plant canopy, and how much is being transmitted to the soil surface. From

258
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:25,288
that information, not only does it tell us how much of the photosynthetic

259
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:29,489
radiation are the plants absorbing but it also tells us something about the

260
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:34,858
leaf area, in between the sensor that is above the canopy and the sensor

261
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:39,239
that's below the canopy. This application is actually taking place

262
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:43,590
right here at this Institute. I'll talk a little bit about it for just a

263
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:48,349
second. Let's switch back over

264
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,368
to the slides. I actually have a picture here of

265
00:24:55,368 --> 00:25:01,558
what's called

266
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,868
a line quantum sensor and making a measurement

267
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:12,329
of the radiation underneath the corn canopy. Here I'm showing a crop canopy

268
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:17,308
but you could do this for you a pasture or an orchard or a forest,

269
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:24,388
whatever, you are interested in. A line quantum sensor is just like this

270
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:29,308
quantum sensor except for there are multiple sensors along the line. This

271
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:33,749
specific one has ten sensors. Each one of these circles that you see here is a

272
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:39,749
sensor. Those ten sensors are spread along a bar that's approximately 70

273
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:43,950
centimeters long. The reason that you want multiple sensors when you make

274
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,769
under canopy measurements is that, the and you can see it in this picture, the

275
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:55,798
light environment underneath the plant canopy is not uniform. You can see

276
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,308
these two sensors up here are in a light Fleck where they're actually getting a

277
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:04,259
lot of sunlight all the rest of the sensors are in the shade. When you

278
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,249
make measurements of radiation underneath the canopy with the line

279
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:16,319
quantum sensor, remember that the radiation is often non-uniform. It works

280
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,589
really well to measure with the line quantum sensor because then you get an

281
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:26,668
average along the length of the line and radiation under the

282
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,570
canopy should be measured in multiple locations because it's

283
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:36,269
no-uniform. It often works best to make a measurement in one location, move it and

284
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:39,599
make a measurement in another location, move it make a measurement in another

285
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,028
location, and average the numbers that way you get a pretty representative idea

286
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:50,759
of what the mean radiation environment is like underneath the

287
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,028
canopy and also how variable it is.

288
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,340
Just to give you an idea the equations are pretty simple where the

289
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:08,949
intercepted radiation, you just measure the photosynthetic radiation above the

290
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:17,440
canopy and below the canopy. The transmittance is the below canopy

291
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,600
measurement divided by the above canopy measurement, and then the fraction

292
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:30,369
intercepted is 1 minus the transmittance. You have to have a quantum sensor

293
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:36,849
above the plant and then a line quantum sensor below the plant. Pretty

294
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:39,939
straightforward and then you just plug the numbers in to get intercepted

295
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:48,640
radiation, transmittance, and the fraction of intercepted radiation. For a

296
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,070
relatively sparse canopy like this one here, you know the leaf area index might

297
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:58,779
be roughly one meter squared of leaf area per meter squared of ground

298
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:03,970
area. In the middle of the day, on a sunny day, the transmittance would be about

299
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,470
50 % where roughly half of the sunlight that you're measuring above the

300
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,360
canopy would actually get transmitted below the canopy. If we were to move to

301
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,589
something like this, where we have a much higher leaf area index a something on

302
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:22,119
the order of 5 meters squared per meter squared in the middle of the day on a

303
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:27,369
sunny day the transmittance would be about an order of magnitude lower, closer

304
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:31,359
to 5 % of the radiation above the canopy is going to get transmitted

305
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:39,250
to the soil below the canopy. Once we have this information, once we have

306
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,190
the transmittance we can actually get some sense of the leaf area index if

307
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:51,150
that's what we're interested in. This shows you a four different plost of

308
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:58,240
transmittance as a function of leaf area index and this would be for a solar

309
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,859
zenith angle of 20 degrees on a relatively clear day.

310
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:07,269
The reason that we have four different lines and they are spaced like that is not

311
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:16,210
only does the leaf area influence the transmittance but the orientation of

312
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,710
the leaves can also have a big impact on the transmittance. The green line

313
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,710
would represent a canopy where most of the leaves are positioned horizontally,

314
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:32,288
where as the red line would represent a canopy where most of the leaves are positioned vertically.

315
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:37,869
Turns out the most plant canopies, I'm not as familiar with forests, but crops tend to

316
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:43,329
be somewhere near these two black lines where you have a fairly even

317
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:53,379
distribution of both horizontal and vertical leave. There's what the data

318
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,990
looks like now at a solar zenith angle of 60 degrees. I will toggle back once just so you can see.

319
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:08,649
It also shows use that not only does leaf area in the position or the orientation

320
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:13,569
of the leaves have a big influence on transmittance but so does the position

321
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:21,939
of the Sun. If we know something about the the leaf angle distribution or

322
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,690
if we can make measurements when all of the lines are you know converged or

323
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,519
close to one another, we can get a good idea of the the leaf area index of our

324
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,710
canopy of interest. I've actually been working on a research project in an

325
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:45,819
alfalfa canopy over the summer and we wanted to to get some idea of the leaf

326
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:50,889
area index as a function of the height of the the plant canopy, and so we made a

327
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:57,940
couple measurements in the recent past at different heights. One was here when

328
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:04,509
the alfalfa was 17 centimeters tall. We got a transmission of about

329
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:11,230
20 % that would correspond to a leaf area of about 1.7 to 1.8 meters

330
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,160
squared per meter squared. Then we made measurements later in the growing

331
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:22,180
when the alfalfa was much taller. It was about 64 centimeters tall and we got a

332
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,860
transmittance that was an order of magnitude lower that would correspond to

333
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:32,889
a leaf area of about 4.7 or 4.8 meters square meter squared. It turns out that

334
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:42,820
these estimates of leaf area 1.8 for a 17 centimeter alfalfa and 4.7 for 64

335
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:50,799
centimeter alfalfa are very close to actual values if we were to sample the

336
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,359
leaves, destructively sample the leaves and measure the leaf area we would get

337
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:01,529
very similar numbers. You can if you're careful with the measurements use

338
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:05,500
transmittance data from from quantum sensors measuring above and below the

339
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:13,480
canopy to get some idea of leaf area and canopy architectures. Real quick, I

340
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,099
mentioned reflected radiation minute ago so it won't spend too much time on this

341
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:25,149
slide. You can also measure reflected radiation using quantum sensors where

342
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:37,150
you orient one up and one down and then the the one measuring the reflectance if

343
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:42,640
you take the ratio of those two numbers you get the reflectance and one minus

344
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,720
that number gives you the amount of or the fraction of the photosynthetic

345
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,779
radiation that was absorbed by the plant canopy. It gives you an idea of how

346
00:32:52,779 --> 00:33:00,269
much radiation is being absorbed by the plant canopy and used for photosynthesis.

347
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:05,319
Just a couple points here. The sensor should be level for both the upward and

348
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:10,990
downward measurements. The upward measurement it's obvious why that

349
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,759
one has to be level Bruce talked about this in his presentation. If it's tilted

350
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,019
a little bit one way or the other, you can actually get pretty significant

351
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:24,129
errors on a sunny day. If you're tilted a little bit towards the Sun it's actually

352
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,930
going to read quite a bit higher than it should if it was level.

353
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,100
If it happens to be not level and tilted a little bit away from the Sun, you'll

354
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:36,699
get a measurement that's a lot lower than it should be. The reason it's

355
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:43,630
important to make sure the downward one is close to level as well so that in a

356
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,930
place like Logan Utah where Bruce and I come from it wouldn't matter that much

357
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,880
because the entire valley where we live is surrounded by tall mountain, but in

358
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,050
places where it's flat when the Sun first comes up over the horizon you want

359
00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:00,279
to make sure thatthe direct sunlight doesn't hit the diffuser and if

360
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:04,389
it's tilted a little bit one way or the other in the in the early morning or

361
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,320
late evening hours you might actually get some direct sunlight hitting the

362
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,950
sensor that's not reflected from the surface&gt; You just want to be careful that

363
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:16,319
you that you level both sensors.

364
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,819
I believe that's all I had for the quantum sensors, any questions about

365
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,900
photosynthetically active radiation, measurements above canopy or below

366
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:30,429
canopy?

367
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:41,358


368
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:46,369
I think that depends on I think that really depends on you and what you want to quantify for

369
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:52,010
application but and I think in my opinion that, and I'm not a tree expert you

370
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,319
would want to know probably still a horizontal measurement because you know

371
00:34:57,318 --> 00:35:04,099
the bottom of the the tree canopy is roughly pair parallel to the ground

372
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:13,130
correct? A right angle, okay there you go but I think that you know it depends on

373
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,818
which orientation you're interested in quantifying the radiation. I don't know

374
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:24,949
that there's a right or wrong answer to that question. You could do either. Any

375
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:27,949
others? Yeah, Bruce.

376
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:33,799
Bruce: Let me mention this people have long predicted

377
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:41,730
photosynthetic radiation from shortwave if you measure one you can precict the other. Mark and Ijust wrote a

378
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:48,929
book chapter for American Society of Agronomy on shortwave radiation, photosynthetic, and UV.

379
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:55,889
The chapter talks about the challenges of predicting one from

380
00:35:55,889 --> 00:36:02,000
the other. It is in more detail than it is here, but that's a forthcoming book

381
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,219
chapter about ratios of radiation.

382
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:09,480
Mark: This is actually a really good point.

383
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,059
Historically weather stations have never had quantum sensors on them.

384
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:18,929
Quantum sensors have really been only been in existence since I guess the

385
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:24,929
early 1970's but they've only really been in widespread use for maybe the past few

386
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:29,779
years. It's not common that you would find a weather station that has a

387
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:35,370
pyrometer on it to give you solar radiation and the quantum sensor on give

388
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:40,829
you photosynthetically active radiation, but there could be you know applications

389
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:46,199
where you need to takeweather data from a weather station and

390
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:50,639
one of the pieces of information that you need is the photosynthetically

391
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,500
active radiation. Bruce is correct you can actually

392
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,050
estimate photosynthetically active radiation from pyranometer

393
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:06,450
measurements of solar radiation. If you're interested in doing that, again

394
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:10,889
grab my card and send me an email. I can provide you with some information. The

395
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:16,170
model that allows you to calculate photosynthetic photon flux from solar

396
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,369
radiation measurements is pretty simple but there are some coefficients in there

397
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:24,599
that can introduce some error and the coefficients are also dependent on the

398
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,559
sky conditions. If you're interested in that or want more detail, I would

399
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,639
gladly talk to you, just see me afterwards or grab my card.

400
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:42,278
Any other comments or questions? Cool just a couple of slides on UV that I can metntion

401
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:47,500
briefly. I can do those now I think lunch was supposed to be 12:30 so we are right on schedule.

402
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,869
I'll just chat about UV real quick. I don't

403
00:37:52,869 --> 00:38:02,278
have a lot to say. I actually failed to mention one point, sorry about that.

404
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:08,230
If you're anxiously awaiting to get to UV wait we'll get there in one

405
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,969
second I forgot this last point on my slide. You can actually

406
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:18,730
measure reflected radiation using a single sensor if you want to. What I

407
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,869
said before is you have one mounted like this that is level and then a second one

408
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,380
mounted like this that was level. That's how you would do it if you wanted to

409
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,519
like continuously measure it over the course of a growing season. If you

410
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:34,719
want to do this instantaneously, you can actually take your sensor and measure it

411
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,250
in this position and then flip it upside down and measure it in this position.

412
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:46,768
Just be careful when you do that that during the time interval that it's here

413
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:52,328
to here that the radiation doesn't change, otherwise you'll get an incorrect

414
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:57,490
number because the incoming number changed. So on a clear sunny day, no

415
00:38:57,489 --> 00:39:02,979
problem. Measure here, flip it over and level it and measure here but on a day

416
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,490
when it's intermittently cloudy you have to be really careful doing something

417
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:12,008
like that. I probably wouldn't recommend it because the clouds can actually

418
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:19,119
change the incoming radiation very quickly. You can put a sensor and maybe

419
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,500
we can even do this at lunch if you're interested because I think it kind of is

420
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,039
intermittently cloudy today we can go plug this USB sensor into a computer and

421
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:32,799
you can watch how dynamic the radiation is on a cloudy day. It changes rapidly

422
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:38,889
and sometimes by a large amounts. If  it's cloudy, especially intermittently

423
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:41,710
cloudy you don't want to measure here and then flip it over and measure here.

424
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,250
You want to be confident the radiation, the background or the incoming radiation

425
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,889
stays the same if you're going using the same sensor and then invert it

426
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:55,949
because the measurements are separated by time.
