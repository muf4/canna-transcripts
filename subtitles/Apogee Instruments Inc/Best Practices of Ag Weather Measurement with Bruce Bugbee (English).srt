1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,769
I’m Bruce Bugbee; I’m the president of Apogee Instruments. I started Apogee in my

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:13,710
garage a long time ago, and I am currently also a professor right up here at Utah State

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,900
University for those of you who don’t know me. My background is plant physiology, and

4
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:26,769
I teach plant physiology. I also teach a course in environmental instrumentation at the university.

5
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:33,009
These are all graduate level classes for students aspiring to get good at what you guys are

6
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:39,628
already good at. And I tell them, if you can get good at this people will come because

7
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:45,808
your services will be in great demand. That’s a background for my class. I always divide

8
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:53,158
that into three things. Part of instrumentation is having some understanding of what we call

9
00:00:53,158 --> 00:01:00,698
the physics of signal transduction. And that means, how does some sensor out there convert

10
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:08,000
wind into an electrical signal for a datalogger? How does it convert temperature, anything,

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,250
into an electrical signal? And when students have a better understanding of that they can

12
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,420
far better diagnose their systems to understand what’s going on. A second part of it is

13
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,740
interfacing sensors to dataloggers. And Campbell Scientific, every year, very graciously donates

14
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:36,299
a whole set of dataloggers for this class. So they get trained on Campbell’s loggers,

15
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,000
interfacing them. Stuff like voltage dividers, hooking them up. And then the third part is

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,629
programming the datalogger. It’s been a popular class, and it’s too bad people don’t

17
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:55,859
teach classes like this more. Because I think increasingly we see people that say “just

18
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,629
give me the data.” But there’s high-quality data and there’s low-quality data, and if

19
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:06,879
you don’t know the difference, you’re about to make bad models and a lot of problems.

20
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,769
So, we’ll get to this in a second. There’s so much stuff we can talk about in a class

21
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:20,269
like this, and I see some really knowledgeable people in the audience. So we can have some

22
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:29,189
exchange instead of me lecturing; we can have some exchange of information. And obviously

23
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:34,318
if you teach a whole semester class in this there’s no way you can condense that into

24
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:43,068
60 minutes. You can just hit some highlights of it. So, I welcome your comments and questions

25
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:53,199
as we go along in this. One of the things that we get asked a lot at Apogee is: How

26
00:02:53,199 --> 00:03:03,438
do you decide on what new sensors to work on? And usually people say, “Could you make

27
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:09,870
a sensor to measure this?” And the answer is always “yes!” But then our question

28
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,099
is of course, “How many would you buy if we made that?” “Well I’d buy one, and

29
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:19,358
both of my buddies would buy one, and you should make that.” You know and what it

30
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:28,230
really comes down to is an estimate of the worldwide size of the market for some new

31
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:37,188
sensor, and sometimes it’s an improvement on an old sensor. And how much R&amp;D would it

32
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:46,989
take to make the first one? And both of those are broad guesses. Anybody affiliated with

33
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:53,459
instrument companies goes through the same thing, and you hope that the market will be

34
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,950
as big as you hope for and the R&amp;D won’t be too much worse than you think, and off

35
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:08,209
you go into a new project. As companies get bigger, and as Apogee has gotten bigger, we

36
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:14,199
can take undertake more ambitious projects. And one of them that you’re going to see

37
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,889
in the hallway, I’m not necessarily going to talk about it here, but one of them is

38
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:26,319
our new weighing precipitation gauge. And we had the great fortune of the Bureau of

39
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,839
Land Management came to us and they said, “Could you make an improved gauge?” and

40
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:37,089
I’d been working with load cells in my laboratory at the university for lysimeters that weigh

41
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,849
plants, and I thought “well how hard can that be? We know how to weigh stuff with load

42
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,390
cells.” Yeah that was over three years ago, and we’re still polishing the product. The

43
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:54,769
R&amp;D for that has been a lot more than we anticipated, but the market is even bigger than we anticipated,

44
00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:03,669
too. So that’s an emerging, cutting-edge thing for the company. Apogee is of course

45
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:11,160
primarily a sensor company, and we started out making radiation sensors. The very first

46
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,660
product was called a quantum sensor, which measures photons for photosynthesis because

47
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,170
that’s right out of my background. At the time, this was 20 something years ago, the

48
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,949
only one that was really widely used, well there was Sky Instruments in the UK and LI-COR

49
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:37,089
in the United States, and I think back then Kipp and Zonen might’ve had one; I can’t

50
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,979
remember when there’s exactly started. But all of those were quite expensive. And we

51
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:50,090
realized if we could just take a simple photodiode and hook it up to a volt meter, and we would

52
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:59,889
have an adequate quantum sensor. And in fact, this morning, I went to the antique instrument

53
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:06,339
collection. Because we have some glass cases down at Apogee now where I’ve been able

54
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:11,339
to display my antique instruments, which I just love. And as the word has spread, people

55
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,439
retire at universities and a couple people have bequeathed their instrument collection

56
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:24,389
to us, so we’re getting better antique instruments. It’s really fun. This is the first product

57
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:30,919
Apogee ever built. And it says “quantum meter.” Quantum is a µmol of photons, and

58
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,670
the sensor’s in the top. And look what it came from, just a low cost voltmeter. We didn’t

59
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,500
have big startup costs. So we just took it apart and modified the voltmeter and made

60
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:50,629
this first sensor. And it still works, and it’s in the museum now. But we built it

61
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:59,589
from there. We kept upgrading this and spread out to other projects. But because the cost…

62
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:04,589
it didn’t do anything another meter didn’t do, it’s just that is was cheaper. It helped

63
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:13,429
a lot of people, and we started the company to do this. Here’s another thing that I

64
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:21,141
grabbed out of the antique instrument collection. This is my first cell phone. The pop-up antenna.

65
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:28,560
And man we thought this was such cool technology you know. That’s in the museum now. If you

66
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,389
get the chance it’s fun, if you like instruments and you like old instruments, it’s fun to

67
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:41,250
go down memory lane and see all these things. I think what I’d like to start with first

68
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:51,170
is just the simplest measurement of temperature and the simplest measurement of air temperature.

69
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,180
We got involved with this because one of the big selling products for Apogee is an infrared

70
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:06,780
radiometer to get surface temperatures. And it’s one of our more expensive instruments,

71
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,859
high-end instrument, really good at getting surface temperatures. But what we always really

72
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,720
need to know to determine energy balance and plant canopies and irrigation requirements

73
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:29,610
of crops is the leaf-to-air temperature difference. Okay, this is environmental science 101: you

74
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,200
need leaf temperature, you need air temperature. What we realized was the air temperatures

75
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:46,140
were wrong when they were measured in a standard, multi-plate static shield. And they’re wrong

76
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:51,528
because the sun shines on the shield, heats it up, and if the wind is not blowing fast

77
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:58,029
enough, it reads high. We’ve always known they read high, but I’ll show you some data

78
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:05,309
about how big that error can be. The world record for the error of a static shield…

79
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:12,119
we have a station at Peter Sinks. I’ve think I’ve got a slide on Peter Sinks. It’s

80
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,899
just up in the mountains, it’s a big bowl, low, cold air pools in there, and we have

81
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:26,009
measured the second lowest temperature in the continental United States here at Peter

82
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:32,980
Sinks for our climate center group. I can show you some data of that in a minute. But

83
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,240
there’s snow on the ground up there and really cold, so we need precision measurements

84
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:44,680
of temperature to a tenth of a degree C. We also have a static shield up there and an

85
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:53,989
Apogee aspirated shield. Not long ago we measured a 13.5 Celsius error in the static shield.

86
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:01,129
It was 13.5 Celsius warmer than the aspirated shield, the sensors were precise sensors on

87
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:09,250
both. Huge! We’re calling that the new world record for the error of a static shield, but

88
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,639
we often see 1 and 2 degree C difference. Partly it’s when there’s snow on the ground

89
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,149
the snow reflects and it bounces up from the bottom and it causes big errors in static

90
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:26,529
shields. But just that simple measurement, wow, that’s the primary measurement—air

91
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:32,951
temperature. And the primary way we measure it, and we have done for a long time, can

92
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:42,870
have much bigger errors than we realize. So let’s start with a sensor. What sensor would

93
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:54,110
you use to measure temperature? Of course there’s thermocouples. But we’ve primarily

94
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,610
relied on PRTs (platinum resistance thermometers) to get accurate measurements of air temperature.

95
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:11,919
And those have been the gold standard for a very long time, but they’re expensive

96
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:19,899
and they’re bigger. Can we get this bigger? Can I slide this back and make this bigger

97
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:30,059
without screwing everything up? We might be able to, maybe there’s a cord... if we can.

98
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:38,069
Oh yeah there you go. That helps. I could’ve done that. That’ll help a little. What’s

99
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:48,800
this thing right here? That helps, that’s good! Oh there we go. This slide... Thanks

100
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,439
let’s turn those off. There we go, now it’s something we can look at. There’s some pretty

101
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:03,080
fine print on this slide. These slides are from a talk that I gave a few years ago with

102
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,250
the American Society of Agronomy had a special symposium on emerging instruments, emerging

103
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,909
trends, weather, and we’ve talked about temperature measurements. But this is thermistors

104
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:25,370
versus PRTs. But the first point in the measurement of temperature is small is better. And if

105
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,060
you’ve worked with that, man we have used some very fine wire thermocouples to get accurate

106
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:36,169
measurements of temperature because they stay in equilibrium with the air temperature better.

107
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:45,159
So, okay, there’s a human hair. We could put a thermocouple in here; they get pretty

108
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,278
small, down around human hairs as you know they’re super fragile and hard to build

109
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:56,830
and all that. But we can get fine wire thermistors quite small now. That thermistor is used in

110
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:02,589
human and animal physiology. You can inject it into living organisms inside of a syringe

111
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:12,100
to get temperature. That’s small. Then for reference there’s a 24 gauge thermocouple,

112
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:19,470
then epoxy bead thermistor, and then a pretty standard PRT, and then a thermistor at the

113
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:29,560
bottom inside a ceramic sheath. So huge range of sizes. As we get bigger, they do not stay

114
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:36,579
in thermal equilibrium with the air. And I’m not talking about response time, it’s the

115
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,860
equilibrium temperature. A big sensor absorbs more solar radiation, and it always warms

116
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,159
above the air temperature depending on the radiation and the wind speed. And sometimes

117
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,309
we measure radiation and wind and back correct what the real temperature was and pretty soon

118
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:58,719
you have fudge factors in here, and you'd like to just have accurate sensors so you

119
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,440
don't have to have a lot of fudge factors. But there's a range of sensors. Let's see…

120
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:17,490
I guess I'm pushing the button right we didn't know… small is better. So when we say PRTs,

121
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:25,200
they are absolutely not created equal. People act like they are “oh I have a PRT.” Well

122
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:36,790
what kind of a PRT? These are the five main classes—C, B, A, 1/3, and 1/10 DIN—and

123
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:45,559
there's a picture up there again. Look at the error specifications for these PRTs. The

124
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:52,379
1/10 DIN is a tremendous, that's a wonderful sensor, but it's fifteen times as expensive

125
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:57,838
as the Class C, and oftentimes people are a little vague about what PRT is in their

126
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,770
instrument. They just say it's a PRT, but you need to know what kind of a PRT. Big differences

127
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:15,769
in PRTs and accuracy. Now, I'm going to talk about the disadvantages of PRTs, other than

128
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:25,549
cost, to get good accuracy. Here is that epoxy bead thermistor up there that was shown in

129
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:34,969
the first slide. Small. Generally smaller than most of the PRTs. There's the accuracy

130
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,000
spec; this is what we call a precision thermistor. This is, by the way, used for the reference

131
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,870
temperature and Campbell Scientific dataloggers inside the can… pretty good spec 0.1 degrees

132
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:59,049
C, and the relative cost is about 1x. So if you look at this live for very long, PRT's

133
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:09,169
are a very cost effective option for measuring temperatures—I'm sorry thermistors—provided

134
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:17,750
it's the right thermistor with the right specs. This is a more expensive thermistor. Now,

135
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:27,220
historically, when I was in graduate school people were cycling thermistors. Some of the

136
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,800
older faculty that did then they would buy them and they'd temperature cycle them. “What

137
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,579
are you doing?” “I'm stabilizing it because after I cycle it enough I find it stabilizes,

138
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:47,870
and then I calibrate the thermistor.” Thermistors have come a long way in the past several decades.

139
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,459
They're much more stable, and they have much better accuracy standards. And there are some

140
00:16:53,458 --> 00:17:02,719
papers in the literature with groups like NIST reference groups that now are starting

141
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,140
to use thermistors as reference standards for temperatures. PRTs are still… expensive

142
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,751
PRTs are still the gold standard but thermistors are much cheaper getting really close. That's

143
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:29,160
this particular thermistor. I think one point right here: thermistors can be less stable

144
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,140
than a PRT. There's a reason to go with a PRT because of long-term stability, but the

145
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:43,480
reason through misters drift, there's two reasons they drift: high temperatures and

146
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:53,679
moisture. High temperatures means higher than 60 degrees C. So it's not… and that starts…

147
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,050
and so the high temperatures are warmer than our environmental temperatures. So it's not

148
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:04,419
really a problem. Moisture is a problem. If they absorb moisture the resistance changes

149
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,310
and they drift. And that can be a killer. So the way to get thermistors accurate is

150
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:20,159
to encase them in a waterproof epoxy or glass. And this is in a waterproof epoxy, and I'll

151
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,290
show you some data on the stability of this sensor in just a minute. So it's possible

152
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:33,180
to make thermistors very stable. For example, Campbell Scientific sells one inside of a

153
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,640
stainless steel sheath. I think that's called the “SS” (I forget the number), but inside

154
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,850
a stainless steel it's encased so it's stable. This particular one is not encased and it's

155
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:50,339
stable because it's epoxy coated. But that's a key consideration with thermistors. Now

156
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:55,869
consider that all the PRT's are resistant sensors as well, but they're encased in stainless

157
00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:05,750
steel to keep moisture away and keep them stable. So here's one of them… the next

158
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:13,400
slide shows you a hidden cost of sensors. The more you work with these, you start to

159
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:22,850
get an appreciation for this. How many channels on a datalogger does your sensor take up?

160
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:30,379
And now that we have digital sensors and evolving dataloggers with digital dataloggers. Wow!

161
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,410
Digital sensors allow you to put a lot of sensors on a smaller datalogger. The days

162
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,840
in which we had big thoughts of channels and multiplexers and CR 7s. We have a lot more

163
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:57,909
digital sensors, but look at what a thermistor takes up. This is two 3 and 4 wire resistance

164
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:07,110
measurements. You can measure resistance with two wires, which is the secondary instrument

165
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:10,959
(this is off the internet). The secondary instrument in this case would be a Campbell's

166
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,490
logger. That's two Channels. It gets more accurate when you have

167
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:24,548
a third wire for a reference and you have a 3 wire measurement. And to achieve those

168
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:31,490
tenth of a degree C accuracies, you really ought to have a 4 wire measurement and a 4

169
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:37,220
wire thermistor. That's a more expensive thermistor because there's more wires and it takes up

170
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:48,929
four analog channels on the datalogger. So thermistors are… they're expensive from

171
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:54,300
the standpoint of channels. Now of course you can digitally measure them and sent a

172
00:20:54,299 --> 00:21:04,619
digital signal, too. What I want to show you now is that our data, collected over many

173
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:11,349
cycles of accelerated aging tests to see how much drift we could cause in these thermistors,

174
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:16,049
because if they if they drift that's a big problem. We need to know, so we do accelerated

175
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:22,480
aging up and down temperature. We have a tray of water in the bottom of the chamber so they

176
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,230
freeze and they get cold and then they are high humidity, so it's a very worst-case scenario

177
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:38,480
and we cycle them. Ninety in this particular data set, 96 cycles minus 20 to plus 60. This

178
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:48,089
is the data. The blue lines are those yellow beat thermistors and the red line is Class

179
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:56,379
A PRTs. Now that's not the highest quality PRTs, but you can see the offsets. And this

180
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,200
graph right here shows after we normalize it to the initial temperatures. Those thermistors

181
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,730
were more stable than that Class A PRT in this test. So it provides evidence that thermistors

182
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:23,319
can be very stable over long period of time. It's another even more rigorous test: 10 months,

183
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:32,730
584 cycles. This is now with high quality PRTs to replicate PRTs deviation from the

184
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:40,700
mean; they were both very very accurate. Here's the data. Twelve replicate thermistors, it

185
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:48,110
looks like the other data but it's in a test. Those thermistors were within, once we got

186
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:54,740
rid of the offset, they were within 0.5 C. So the point is thermistors can be impressively

187
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,370
stable if they're encased properly. So here's an example, I talked about Peter Sinks example

188
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:08,808
of but what we do with Peter Sinks. There's a picture of it. It's a big basin up in the

189
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:16,230
mountains, and we're sort of… you don't have to live here very long and you learn

190
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:28,029
this story. In 1985 we measured -56.3 C at Peter Sinks. It was the record low temperature

191
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:34,160
for Utah and the second coldest temperature ever recorded in the continental United States.

192
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,430
Second! Yeah! What was that first? We're still going for that first place we haven’t got

193
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:46,970
it yet. Global warming's not helping us. The coldest temperature ever measured was -69.7

194
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:56,339
at Rogers Pass Montana, 1954. So look at the difference where we missed it by four tenths

195
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:01,859
of a degree Fahrenheit the record. So we're waiting for it. We’d just love it if we

196
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,750
got a super cold winter and we could get that record. So we got a lot of instruments up

197
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:15,099
there to do this. This is a picture of the station up there with the bottom of the bowl,

198
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:22,918
and there's where we have these two yellow bead thermistors and two replicate high quality

199
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:37,620
PRTs. Those are inside of that aspirated shield. Looking up from the bottom. I've got some

200
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:43,189
data in here on the comparison of those, and they've been up there for several years now.

201
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,910
I’ve forgotten. Bob do you remember how long those have been up there? I don't know.

202
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:54,400
It's I don't know five or eight years or something like that. Just replicate measurements inside

203
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,360
an aspirated shield to get, and they're both tracking really closely within a tenth of

204
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:12,119
a degree C. So that's the story on measuring temperature. We're big fans of precision thermistors,

205
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,558
and in fact the Apogee aspirated shield has this yellow bead thermistor inside of it for

206
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:26,589
air temperature. The next thing I want to talk about is the importance of aspirated

207
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,720
shields because it's one thing to have a good sensor, but we mentioned a minute ago if you

208
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,929
don't have it in the right housing you're going to have an error from the housing. Andrew

209
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:41,680
Sanford is here. Andrew you've worked on this stuff your whole life, you got any additional

210
00:25:41,680 --> 00:26:07,679
comments of PRTs? “Most meteorological services take them as a reference. They treat them

211
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,030
as a reference instrument.” Yeah. [unintelligible]. Yeah. They still are a reference instrument

212
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:21,899
to me and that is as the reference instrument in this. [unintelligible]. Just be careful

213
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:32,440
if you forget the PRTs. This next series of slides is this a separate talk, and I'm going

214
00:26:32,440 --> 00:27:03,298
to close this and open the next talk here. Let's see… if I was… There… This is

215
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:13,210
slides from another talk that we gave at a another professional conference. Mark Blonquist,

216
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,500
if you haven't already met him is here and he's the chief scientist at Apogee. And Apogee

217
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,740
we don't have vice presidents we have chiefs. We have chief scientists, chief operating

218
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:34,230
officer, and Ryan Lindsay is a mechanical engineer. These are slides about the performance

219
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:42,230
of an aspirated shield that Apogee has sold for a while, which also took a lot longer

220
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:50,759
to develop and refine than we thought. But it has helped us understand the errors that

221
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:59,150
we are all getting when we use static shields. Because we all use those. They're cheap and

222
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,280
there's improvements in those by the way. I mean some static shields are better than

223
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,599
others, but if the sun is shining and the wind is not blowing they're gonna heat up.

224
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:16,009
So this is just a little diagram of wind and solar radiation and what you get with air

225
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:28,220
temperature. So let's take a look. This is Jonathan Wright is with MetSpec in the UK,

226
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,529
and MetSpec is a company that's made an improved static shield that we have tested extensively.

227
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:40,500
Bart Nef is at Campbell scientific. We deployed these in a lot of cases, collected a lot of

228
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:47,569
data over the years. This is a lot of text, but it basically it says to determine the

229
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:55,579
quantity the amount of error of static shields. Ultimately so we can get accurate leaf-to-air

230
00:28:55,579 --> 00:29:05,800
temperature differences. This is a hot topic, and when you think about science, what do

231
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:13,080
we do in science? We do research. And the word research is “re” “search.” We

232
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,389
take what we thought we knew and study it again. And boy do we find a lot of stuff that

233
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:25,350
we thought we knew and we didn't really know it very well. That's all of science. So this

234
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:33,399
is not just us looking at these errors. There's 30 peer-reviewed papers on the errors of static

235
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,970
shields over the last 15 years. It's a particularly big now if we're going to quantify global

236
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,250
warming and air temperatures. Well we gotta measure air temperature. And I've said look

237
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,440
we can solve global warming everybody just switch to aspirated shields and the problem

238
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:57,910
will go away because it's gonna make the earth appear to be cooling. So these are a couple

239
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:06,490
of comparison shields in this data set. It's a multi-plate shield. R. M. Young has long

240
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,720
beta aspirated shield. We call it the Darth Vader shield because of the way the helmet

241
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,890
looks, opens up to get sensors in there. It takes, here's the problem: it's not widely

242
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:25,451
used at all because it is a very power hungry fan. It's a centrifugal blower. You're not

243
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:31,298
going to run that unless you have massive solar panels, and our stations are places

244
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:40,750
where we have low power. So Apogee’s goal was to make an accurate aspirated shield that’s

245
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:50,279
also very low power. But these are some of the shields we compared it to. And then statics

246
00:30:50,279 --> 00:31:01,639
have a humidity probe. Now, back to Peter Sinks. Here's some data. Different from the

247
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,150
active shield. Now that's the active shield’s always cooler, but this data is just what

248
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:15,910
you might think and there's the wind speed. So they don't… after the wind is 3 to 4

249
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:22,288
meters a second, we're down in the errors of 0.1 to 0.2 degrees C, but the errors were

250
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:31,119
much worse over snow. So if you need to make measurements over snow, static shields have

251
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,699
particular problems because they're designed to block the radiation coming in from the

252
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:43,370
top. They're not designed to block reflected radiation. So some of those errors get to

253
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:49,909
1 to 1 1/2 C. These are multiple measurements over a long period of time, all summarized.

254
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:56,669
Now we come back down to the valley. And this is measurements in the backyard at Campbell

255
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:06,669
Scientific. Multiple types of shields, a sonic anemometer to get wind speed, multiple replicates.

256
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:14,788
All of them have that small yellow bead thermistor inside the shield, so they're all measuring

257
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:25,179
an accurate temperature. There's the Met one. There's the Apogee. Those are MetSpec shields.

258
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,600
So all the types of shields. I won't go into all the brands, but there's a lot of stuff

259
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:46,619
on here. So this… I think this data right here is just the temperature difference of

260
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:56,239
the, this is the variation of just the yellow bead thermistor. And now we get to the data

261
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,009
from… I can't remember I think we ran this for about a year in the field. And this graph

262
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:11,700
on, let's see, your right, shows a similar thing that we saw at Peter Sinks, only now

263
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:21,058
this is not over snow this was just over grass. But now we compared a small thermistor inside

264
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:26,779
the shield with a humidity probe in the shield. And that's how we all do it is that humidity

265
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:34,000
probe in that shield. Well that's thermally massive, so that heats up more than the LOB

266
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,180
thermistor. And now even when we got pretty significant wind speeds, we still were down

267
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:49,110
around 0.2 degrees C heating from that humidity probe. The fact that this line flattens out

268
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:54,928
suggests there's some offset, and that humidity probe it didn't even go to 0 by 8 or 9 meters

269
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:00,591
a second. But the humidity probes confound the problem because they're just big. Even

270
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:06,479
if they have an accurate PRT in them. More data. We've done this in

271
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,440
the what we call the backyard at Apogee Instruments—a big grassy area where we just, same as Campbell’s,

272
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,349
are set up to do continuous testing of products, characterized long-term stability of them.

273
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:28,389
This is the, that's a picture taken from the roof of Apogee of this this line of shields.

274
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:35,289
We were pleased that the Apogee shield slightly outperformed the R.M. Young shield even with

275
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:43,699
a much smaller fan of almost a tenth of the power for the fan. This is solar radiation

276
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:49,848
and heating, and now we're talking differences in tenths of a degree C among types of aspirated

277
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:56,119
shields. So the air is getting small, but we're trying to get down as close as we can

278
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:07,010
to 0. So that's the that's an example of testing that we've done on temperature sensors and

279
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:16,280
aspirated shields. The aspirated shield and the Apogee shield test PWM modulation. Running

280
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:23,610
full blast, it takes 80 mA. Now remember that R.M. Young is right around 500 mA. So it's

281
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:30,700
a big drop from that. But what we have found is you only need to run the fan fault blast

282
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:36,189
if it's no wind and the sun is full, so you can turn the fan down. Especially at night,

283
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:42,510
we can turn the fan down. If the wind is blowing, then turn the fan down. Sun’s setting, turn

284
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:48,020
the fan down. So you can optimize power. And it's not… we have many stations running

285
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:54,690
that up aspirated shield from relatively small solar panel. Still takes a lot more than the

286
00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:04,280
datalogger, but it's much less than previous aspirated shields. This hasn't really caught

287
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:12,470
on. Apogee’s had steady sales of this, but I still feel like man if people knew the errors

288
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:17,949
they have they’d be more interested in trying to do aspirated shield measurements. And frankly,

289
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:22,949
I think most people just eliminate it right away because they say “well I don't have

290
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:28,549
the power to run a fan aspirated shield. I know they're better.” But boy solar panels

291
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:37,500
and batteries, you don't have to be that much bigger to run the aspirated shield. So that's

292
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:46,519
temperature. Just sensors and shields. Just forgetting an accurate measurement of temperature.

293
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:55,829
One of the places that aspirated shields have found an application is in temperature monitoring

294
00:36:55,829 --> 00:37:05,299
in fruit orchards. Where, if you know anything about fruit production, they live and die

295
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:13,630
by late spring frost, which can kill the flowers and wipeout their yield for the year. And

296
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:20,940
as the temperatures start to get close to freezing, they start wind machines, they start

297
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:27,429
running water sprinklers to keep their plants from freezing. In Utah, the growers tell me

298
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:36,098
those wind machines cost $10,000 an hour to run, but it's worth it because the value of

299
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:42,500
the crop is greater than the cost of the running their wind machines. Ten thousand dollars

300
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,059
an hour! Man, if they could delay turning those on for a half an hour, they paid for

301
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:52,679
their measurement system in one night. So they need to know, they don't want to turn

302
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:58,139
them on unless they have to, but when they need them, they got to run them. And how are

303
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:06,108
they measuring temperature? In a static shield. Okay. And they say “well it's at night it's

304
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:14,710
not solar loading on the shield, so I don't really have to have aspirated shield.” I

305
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,730
don't have the data in here, but when we did tests in an orchard, these are calm nights.

306
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:29,550
They get radiation frosts, so it's calm and there's not wind to mix the air. The lag time

307
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:36,039
on those static shields was enormous. I mean the temperature in those was like a half an

308
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:41,130
hour to reach the true air temperature where an aspirated shield is fast response. They

309
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:48,150
got the air temperature right away. So the growers, the fruit growers, are increasingly

310
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:54,900
using aspirated shields not just to get more accurate temperatures but to get faster response

311
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:03,780
temperatures at night. We also use them, we have a network in Cache Valley, we have a

312
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:12,540
project here called… can I turn these lights back on, Chris? We're over here? I can probably

313
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:19,130
get them here hold on let’s see... There I'm just gonna talk for a minute. We have

314
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:25,070
a project here in Cache Valley called the Atmospheric Mixing Project. It's one through

315
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:31,850
the university. And so far it's been largely funded with the gracious help of the instrument

316
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,469
companies. But I don't know how many visits you guys have been here, and you probably

317
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:42,689
don't come in January, but we get inversions all the time in January. Cold air settles,

318
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:47,079
and that cold air sits there and it's trapped. And all of our emissions stay with us and

319
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:53,190
the air quality deteriorates. So the state of Utah is getting a black eye for low air

320
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,730
quality, so they're starting to put more money into this. We are interested in the magnitude

321
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,900
of atmospheric mixing during these inversions because people think “oh there's no mixing

322
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:12,470
it's just trapped air.” So with these sensors, we have seen large Eddie's of air, but it's

323
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:19,719
cold… cold… and all of a sudden whoa the temperature jumps 2 degrees C as warmer air

324
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:25,750
mixes with the air, and then it comes back down/ And you can see these patterns of air

325
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:31,460
mixing in the valley, and we would only see that with accurate measurements of air temperature

326
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:39,059
with a fast response shield. That's another thing that's been helpful for us. I've given

327
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,230
talks about this project, atmospheric mixing, and it's really of interest if you live here

328
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:50,760
because you want to have good air in the winter. But it's a fascinating project. We're using

329
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,630
carbon dioxide as a tracer gas to look at the atmospheric mixing. We're finding some

330
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:04,000
really fascinating stuff. There's more atmospheric mixing than we used to think, and it's all

331
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,829
because we've got good instruments out there so we can see it. I told you to interrupt

332
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:22,340
me if you had questions, but you’re just listening so let me ask you: What are some

333
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,820
of the instruments that, I don't have comprehensive knowledge on all instruments, but I don't

334
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,500
want to talk about instruments that you’re not interested in. Let me ask you what things

335
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:45,659
you are most interested in. Yes? [unintelligible]. Yes. I don't have a picture in here, but those

336
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:50,649
were developed. But part of my work at the university is funded by the fruit growers.

337
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:56,440
And Utah is not a major agricultural state, but it is a major fruit growing state. I think

338
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,970
we're second in the nation for tart cherries for example. So I don't forget that few hundred

339
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:13,828
million dollars a year of fruit sold. So these guys need to do frost protection, so we made

340
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:23,680
this flat disc that's painted black to get a low-cost way to get a surface temperature

341
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:29,661
on a cold night with no wind. And I think we call that the leaf and bud sensor. It has

342
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:40,440
just a thermistor sticking out, too. When you run the numbers, from energy balance numbers,

343
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:50,409
surface temperatures we've measured 9 degrees C colder than the air temperature at night.

344
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:58,629
Nine Celsius. This is turf temperature now. One of our climate people, we have a station

345
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,760
on campus that measures this from real-time graphs. One of my favorite stories is one

346
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,100
of our elite climate scientists said, “Bruce something is wrong with your numbers. It says

347
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:14,630
the turf is 9 degrees C colder than the air.” And so one of my colleagues jumped in and

348
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,809
he says, “Let me give you a lecture on atmospheric physics. That's real data. There's nothing

349
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:25,719
wrong with the sensors. It's cooling to the air at night.” And so now a fruit grower

350
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:31,980
doesn't really care what the air temperature is, they care what their bud temperature is.

351
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,780
And so this is a low-cost way to estimate bud temperatures. We often model it depth

352
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:44,790
depending on wind speed and, well mostly wind speed and sky long wave radiation to the

353
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:53,849
Sky. So that's why we sell that. On that same note, this is something I use in teaching.

354
00:43:53,849 --> 00:44:03,950
If you take a box and we draw this. Let’s see if I can draw and talk…I know this analogy

355
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:07,939
works because I've seen my students use it to teach other students, so it's stuck with

356
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:15,800
them. It's on that exact topic. And I've done this; I’ve got pictures of doing this in

357
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:26,769
my backyard. Here's a big insulated box. All insulated. On the bottom of this, we put a

358
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:34,980
little dish of water, paint it black. Black saucer with water in it. Now we take this

359
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:42,570
at night and put it outside under a clear sky. And let's take July, so it's a good warm

360
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:50,320
July night. The temperature over here is 20 degrees C. But this insulation prevents this

361
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,130
from warming up. This can be cellophane over the top or it can just be open, but there's

362
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:03,300
not a lot of wind. Here's the question: What happens to the temperature of the water in

363
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:10,609
that dish on a clear sky night? Especially in the mountains here with, close to outer

364
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:18,380
space. Dry air. Very clear sky. So you hook this up to your Campbell Scientific datalogger

365
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,289
with one of those precision thermistors, you drill a tiny little hole, you measure it.

366
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:30,539
And you got the… yeah I don't know the CR100x over here. You measure that temperature. The

367
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:38,719
water starts to come in equilibrium with the sky temperature because of radiation. This

368
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:51,159
is losing… shown here in red… losing energy by longwave radiation to the sky. And it loses

369
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:59,059
it and it loses it and the sky temperature, well the temperature of outer space is 0 K.

370
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:05,909
Skies is really cold. This can't warm back up because it's got all this insulation, and

371
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:12,319
there's not wind to blow warm air in here. It gets colder and colder and finally the

372
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:19,869
water freezes. On a warm summer night you can make water freeze. So when I teach this

373
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:25,829
I show pictures of me with this setup sitting there at night with my computer and measuring

374
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:32,810
this. You can make the water freeze. Then the sun comes up and you cover it, and you

375
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:39,909
have a thermally of environmentally cooled refrigerator. And in fact in some cases in

376
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:47,139
the tropics with no electricity you can use this to keep stuff cool. But it's a powerful

377
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:57,309
example of what radiation can do to surface temperatures and why understanding radiation

378
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:05,088
is important to understanding surface temperatures beyond air temperature. We get into this a

379
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:13,019
lot because of our infrared sensor for surface temperatures. And in this gradient from leaf

380
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:21,721
to air mostly for agricultural irrigation. Predicting transpiration rates of crops. That's

381
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:27,420
a long answer to the leaf and bud sensor, but the leaf and bud sensor is a much cheaper

382
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:33,050
sensor than the infrared stuff. So for fruit growers, they can buy it. Where do you sell

383
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:46,380
them? [unintelligible] It's a… [unintelligible] Oh really! And they need to worry about freezing?

384
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:58,789
[unintelligible] Yeah. Good! And they've worked for you? That's good. Yeah the fruit growers

385
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:11,289
in Utah use them… Other measurements that you're stuck on? If I don't know about it

386
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:21,239
I'll tell you. We… okay let me say a few things about humidity. That might be the next

387
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:28,649
most important parameter that we worry about. And this is just now my broad experience over

388
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:34,519
doing this. When I was in graduate school a long time ago, capacitance chip sensors

389
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:40,300
came out, and Visalia was the first to do these. And everybody is Wow! you know because

390
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:46,530
we were really doing the wet-bulb psychrometer 's. Man all these super labor-intensive ways

391
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:53,640
to get humidity. And capacitance sensors came out, and they were a huge breakthrough. But

392
00:48:53,639 --> 00:49:03,000
they were not so stable. They would get contaminated with some other gas. They go haywire. That

393
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,780
was 30 years ago. And now we have multiple companies making these. The coatings are much

394
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:15,810
better. The sensors are far more stable. And now that's, we use capacitance humidity sensors

395
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:27,960
all over the place. Both Campbell Scientific and Apogee have started selling capacitance

396
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:36,440
type humidity sensors from a company called EE Electronics. And our tests with those over

397
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:44,559
long term periods of time indicate impressive stability of those sensors. So we not only

398
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,199
do we get better job knowing leaf and air temperatures, but the capacitance humidity

399
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:56,489
sensors have come a long way. And they continue to come a long way. Sensors getting better

400
00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:03,838
and cheaper. That's one of the things that drives this whole enterprise of weather measurement

401
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:13,549
is the progress worldwide that we have made in better sensors, and better a lot at electronics

402
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,010
to measure those sensors, and of course now the new frontier is just getting the data

403
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:23,890
in the cloud and getting it sent by wireless so you can see all the data and better summarize

404
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:33,029
it in real time. My field is agriculture. And the weather is, not many disciplines where

405
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:40,040
weather is more important than food production, so it's been a big thing for agricultural

406
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:45,829
weather and of course now climate change, effects of climate change continue to drive

407
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:53,199
it. But it's fun to see the new developments in sensors every year. Whether we build them

408
00:50:53,199 --> 00:51:00,289
and we sell them or somebody else builds them. Now I got to tell you a story. There's an

409
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:08,440
international show in Europe each year, MedTech. It's called Meteorological Technology International

410
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:15,710
(MTI). And it's all the major equipment manufacturers getting together and showing their stuff.

411
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:22,119
So it's organized. There's a company that organizes it. And I… Apogee’s gone so

412
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:31,380
has Campbell’s for many years in a row. And you get to know the organizers. So they

413
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:37,190
go “wow! We can't believe these instrument people, these meteorologists. You guys are

414
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:42,730
all talking to each other. We do a show that's an automotive show, and people put curtains

415
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,630
around their booth because they're so confidential about what they're doing. They're just paranoid

416
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:53,200
about their competitors finding out some little secret, and here you guys are just complimenting

417
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:58,149
each other on the new instruments you're building!” He says it's night and day different than

418
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:04,309
the automotive people. That makes this field so much fun; it's so science driven. And we're

419
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:15,710
competing on good science, not smoke and mirrors and things. It's the… And that also pushes

420
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:24,170
people to make better instruments, too. Keep going. How about solar radiation? Another

421
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:34,539
key parameter. The classic… I had pictures in here of… you know what thermopile pyranometers

422
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:38,949
look like. They were built by Eppley for years and years when I was in graduate school was

423
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:45,149
whoa you got an Eppley you know. I haven't visited Eppley, but they cannot have much

424
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:51,539
of a science department because they haven't released an improved pyranometer in a very

425
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:57,338
long time. But the shape is still the same: white flying saucer with the glass dome and

426
00:52:57,338 --> 00:53:04,940
a black body underneath. So Kipp and Zonen has been working on this, and then right down

427
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:12,490
the street is Hukseflux. Both in the same city. Both making… competing with each other

428
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:20,219
for the best pyranometers in the world. And it's a big market because of solar photovoltaics—precisely

429
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:31,539
measuring that. But the instruments are still expensive. So, maybe, 30 years ago LI-COR

430
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:40,639
came out with a silicon pyranometer. Way cheaper, and it's calibrated to sun, and you get close

431
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:51,289
to the same accuracy for a fraction of the cost. I think this is used worldwide. So that

432
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:59,429
became a standard on lots of weather stations. And many, probably 20 years ago, Apogee also

433
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:08,568
made a silicon pyrometer. Lower cost than LI-COR, but the same type of sensor to get

434
00:54:08,568 --> 00:54:20,250
solar radiation. Those are fine as long as you have a sunny day in the same conditions

435
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:26,690
that they were calibrated in. Because they subsample the solar spectrum. And any time

436
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:32,079
you subsample and predict the whole thing, you're okay as long as your calibration conditions

437
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:38,549
don't change. One of the tests Apogee has done is: How accurate are those

438
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:45,850
sensors on cloudy days? Clouds at the water vapor absorption bands mean that there's more

439
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:53,588
shortwave. It's all shortwave… they’re more shorter wavelength radiation. Those sensors

440
00:54:53,588 --> 00:55:02,009
can have up to a 14% error on a cloudy day because of a spectral shift caused by water

441
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:13,579
vapor absorption in the clouds. And this had been really underappreciated, so Apogee started

442
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:24,609
looking at approaches to measure all the wavelengths without having to use the cost of the blackbody

443
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:32,639
parameter that is used by Kipp and Zonen and Hukseflux. And a few years ago… so then

444
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:37,420
we find things and test and test and test, the whole roof is, not the whole roof, but

445
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,139
most of the roof at Apogee is covered with test sensors it’s always… we built a staircase

446
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:53,108
to go up there to keep doing tests. Apogee developed a blackbody pyranometer that's small.

447
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:59,559
It's a blue color. That doesn't subsample the spectrum anymore. Measures the whole thing.

448
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:09,099
Doesn't have that cloudy day error. It's close to the same accuracy as those more expensive,

449
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:16,440
larger blackbody parameters by Kipp and Zonen and Hukseflux. We've got some and the other

450
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:25,470
side of the door; the guys will show them to you. It's sold here by Campbell Scientific.

451
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:29,949
It's another story, but a lot of meetings to decide what color that should be. And actually,

452
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:34,829
Campbell's chose the color, but it's a certain blue to be a trademark color of blue. And

453
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:40,619
it's striking. You see that's a unique blue color, and it says Campbell Scientific on

454
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:45,309
the front. And you turn it around on the back and it says in 2 pt. font it says “Manufactured

455
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:50,769
by Apogee Instruments.” So we make that, and Campbell’s sells it in the United States.

456
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:56,608
That's a pretty big breakthrough. That sensor is much lower cost, a much smaller digital

457
00:56:56,608 --> 00:57:07,469
output, compared to the Delft Netherlands bigger sensors. There's another example of

458
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:15,328
a continuing march to get more cost-effective measurements, better measurements for lower-cost,

459
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:21,740
fast response, all of those things. Radiation has certainly been a core strength of Apogee.

460
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:32,909
Starting with quantum sensors and pyrometers. Once Apogee got a blackbody pyrometer, that

461
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:39,259
led to the development of a net radiometer. And they are on the other side of the door.

462
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:46,690
But, oh wow! Perfect! Yes this is my helper here. Thank you for remembering this. It is

463
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:54,210
a picture. Net radiation is something that's so expensive that we've almost always modelled

464
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:58,750
it instead of trying to measure it. So we have some papers in the literature about the

465
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:03,409
errors you get when you try and model it. And the sensors are big. They're not only

466
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:10,789
expensive, but they're heavy. So with this new technology, we could make a much smaller

467
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:16,800
net radiometer. And net radiation means up and down shortwave and up and down long wave

468
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:26,660
radiation. So there's four sensors in this, and it gives you the full radiation energy

469
00:58:26,659 --> 00:58:33,409
balance for a canopy. For precision measurements of all kinds of things including irrigation

470
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:41,170
requirements of agricultural crops. So to get reflected radiation you need to you can't

471
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:46,309
be sub sampling the radiation, you need to measure it. Also, these went into this sensor.

472
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:50,309
Then you get the sensor and oh remember those channels on the

473
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:55,980
Datalogger? You got four sensors. We have four differential channels. Oof, you've used

474
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:03,750
up your whole datalogger just to measure net radiation. Here comes SDI-12 output, Modbus

475
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:12,389
output, this has SDI-12 output. And all of those numbers are put into one and sent to

476
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:20,379
the datalogger. So… and we were able to offer this at a considerably lower cost than

477
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:25,818
the larger ones and created lots and lots of test data on this comparing them to Kipp

478
00:59:25,818 --> 00:59:33,719
and Zonen and Hukseflux pyranometers. This is another steady march of sensors and coupled

479
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:43,739
with the digital output so it's easier to interface this with the datalogger now. Yeah

480
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:48,919
we're pleased this is… sometimes you build stuff and it catches on, and this is one that

481
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,900
did. The sales and this have been bigger than we thought they would be. They’re worldwide

482
00:59:53,900 --> 01:00:06,160
sales. Let's see, what else do I want to say about this?... Yeah, that comes from radiation

483
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:13,039
measurement being a core expertise. The longwave radiation is the same thing as our infrared

484
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:19,139
sensors. Which are measuring longwave radiation, so the up and down longwaves come from our

485
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:24,558
expertise into a longwave. Again, lots of testing so… yes? “With you testing um,

486
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:34,559
so Eppley you know they’re old but they seem to be quite well respected by people.”

487
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:41,630
They do. “But I’m not familiar with watching new stuff. How does Apogee’s sensors compare

488
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:48,320
to say Eppley’s?” Um, let me start by saying, if you get a good reputation if you

489
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,250
get a bad reputation it's hard to change it, if you get a good reputation it’s hard to

490
01:00:52,250 --> 01:01:00,500
change it, too. For the reasons you say. I mean if in fact my… are my Eppley’s in

491
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:05,300
the museum, Chris? I think one of them is. I have some in my lab that we don't use them

492
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:15,519
anymore, but there's a couple problems that with Eppley’s. One is really quite poor

493
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:23,079
cosine response. It's at the low angle light is either under measured or over measured,

494
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:30,269
and there's multiple papers in the literature on this. And man if I was in charge of Eppley

495
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:36,570
I'd be going to work on fixing that problem. But to my knowledge they have not; they have

496
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:41,500
not released new sensors that fix that problem. That causes errors, and this is a competitive

497
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:46,920
market. You're trying to get these numbers to 1 or 2 % today, and now you’ve got a

498
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:54,190
5 % cosine error at the end of the day. They've also had issues with temperature has to be

499
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:58,510
accurate over a range of temperatures. You know because all you're trying to do is solar

500
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:06,540
radiation temperature. That's one of the big things it's a thermopile device, so that's

501
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:11,969
one of the big things that Kipp and Zonen and Hukseflux have made great progress on.

502
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:20,989
Making their measurements more accurate. So it depends on who you talk to. I mean if you're

503
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:30,818
talking to kind of cutting-edge meteorologists, Eppley sort of in the dust. But it depends

504
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:37,119
you know how much you've looked at the new improvements of sensors over the years. I

505
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,400
haven't, I mean I always think maybe they'll come out with something new, but to my knowledge

506
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:52,320
they haven't. “So you feel like they’ve been beat?” I really do. Yeah, I really

507
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:59,588
do. “Are there any situation where it’s better?” Oh man. Maybe if you had some network

508
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:07,690
of Eppley’s and you wanted to have consistency, but I wouldn't recommend them for a new network.

509
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:15,460
Part of it is driven by the fierce competition between Hukseflux and Kipp and Zonen. I mean

510
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:22,440
they're both in Delft in the Netherlands and I don't know how far apart they are… 2 or

511
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:33,720
3 km apart or something? Yeah 0.3 km apart. They got binoculars looking at each other

512
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:42,199
I guess. And man… and then one of my favorites is Hukseflux comes out with an ad “The quest

513
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:48,169
for global domination is over! Introducing the new Hukseflux!”So that's the kind of

514
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:56,650
competition there, and it's pretty fierce. I think both make really good instruments.

515
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:01,750
It's so… but they're high-end, so it leaves the door open to come in at an intermediate

516
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:10,019
price point. All instruments, you know you draw a graph and you get… and see if I can

517
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:28,989
draw this graph up here… this is gonna this is going to be a really classic instrument

518
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:53,389
graph. But… and that graph always looks something like this. And you really pay a

519
01:04:53,389 --> 01:05:01,868
lot of money to go from here, to there. It's, you know, those last few percent to get really

520
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:08,590
expensive, and none of us has an unlimited supply of money. So we're always trying to

521
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:17,640
pick the most cost-effective sensors. You go down in here, and you get cheap. So depending

522
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:27,139
on what you're doing, there's a zone in there that's a real cost-effective midpoint. And

523
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:32,789
that's certainly served Apogee well is identifying that for different markets. If we could build

524
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:39,960
something with this accuracy for this price, it'll be very cost-effective. And that's the

525
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:49,048
case with this net radiometers and pyranometers is trying to hit some point in here where

526
01:05:49,048 --> 01:05:55,619
we're almost as good accuracy and half the cost. So that sort of thing. But it depends

527
01:05:55,619 --> 01:06:03,200
on the application, too. Which brings up customer support. Man if you can't educate your customers,

528
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:09,980
you shouldn't be in business. You're not… the goal is to help them make better measurements.

529
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:15,730
Teach them the options, and don't inappropriately push your own stuff. I mean I would never

530
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:20,101
say that the Apogee pyranometers are better than Kipp and Zonen and Hukseflux. They're

531
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:27,480
not. But they're close, and here's the test data to show that. The price is easy because

532
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:34,548
you can look that number up. But the performance requires a lot of test data. Even specifications,

533
01:06:34,548 --> 01:06:40,400
oh God don't get me started on that, people write these specs, Andrew could tell you this

534
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:48,710
too, some companies exceed their specs regularly and, frankly, Campbell Scientific is a company

535
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:56,510
that exceeds their specs. I can tell a dozen stories where we tested specs and in every

536
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:04,220
case the dataloggers exceeded the specs. Some companies, oh man, they’re absurd. They

537
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:09,909
can't even come close to meeting the specs they published. This is lesser companies selling

538
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:15,798
all kinds of things. But the more a company tests a product the better they can define

539
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:21,088
the performance and the specs. It takes a long time to get the sensor to market when

540
01:07:21,088 --> 01:07:29,338
you're spending all that time doing it, but it's so the goal is to help customers understand

541
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:35,759
specifications and what's the most appropriate sensor for their market. And really, any company

542
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,740
that can educate their customers has got customers for life. They love it that they learn from

543
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:47,719
the people in that company and they will come back. Of course you try it if you do something

544
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:56,259
wrong you're gonna fix it, all those sorts of things, too. How're we doing on time? “We’ve

545
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:03,020
got a workshop set up next door.” Yeah it's too bad there's a door because it'd be nice

546
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:10,858
to have the workshop around here, but… I mean my whole life is teaching, and I have

547
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:17,729
the great honor to teach some really smart graduate students. Some of them are now working

548
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:21,650
at Campbell's that's, I'm sorry, well that's true, some of them are working at Campbell's

549
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:26,018
and some of them are working at Apogee. And that's one of the things that makes the companies

550
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:32,569
go is access to the talent of the university. Lots of those people they love living here;

551
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:36,069
they don’t want to leave. So they turn down higher paying jobs and stay here for work

552
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:42,589
for the companies. But one of the things I've learned about teaching is you never teach

553
01:08:42,588 --> 01:08:48,009
anything when stand up and give a lecture. All the learning happens when you go outside

554
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:55,609
and apply the theory that you learned in the classroom. Students come back all the time

555
01:08:55,609 --> 01:09:01,039
and they say, “oh man! I learned more in the first year I after I graduated than I

556
01:09:01,038 --> 01:09:05,679
did in my four years getting my bachelor's degree.” And I go, “Thank you! We set

557
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:11,069
you up for that.” All that theory. Boom! Everything clicked. The learning happened

558
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:18,139
when they did it, and when they get to ask their own questions and drill it in. So that's

559
01:09:18,139 --> 01:09:25,828
the way we set up—lots of time to look at the instruments and ask questions. Get to

560
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:31,548
know our people that do the customer supports so when you need help you know who to ask.

561
01:09:31,548 --> 01:09:39,439
I'll be here, and I'm happy to interact with you more. I look forward to interacting with

562
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:46,809
you more. Thanks for coming! I guess we have dinner after this, too. You guys are from

563
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:53,288
all over the world right? It's a great honor to talk to you. Thanks!
