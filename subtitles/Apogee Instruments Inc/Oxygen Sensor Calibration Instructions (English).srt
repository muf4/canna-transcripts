1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:04,250
This is the Apogee Instruments Oxygen sensor

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,291
and unlike most of our sensors

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:08,833
this sensor is user calibrated.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,333
We don't know exactly where

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,041
you plan on using your sensor

6
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,541
so in order to get the most accurate results

7
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,791
we have you the customer calibrate this sensor.

8
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:20,207
But don't worry I'll walk you through the steps.

9
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,416
Now calibrating the oxygen sensor can be as simple

10
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,041
or a little more involved

11
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,582
depending on the level of accuracy that you need.

12
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,916
I'm gonna show you how to get good

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,207
better and best results with your oxygen sensor

14
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,707
and if you stick to the end

15
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:35,375
I'm gonna show

16
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,582
you a tip for getting high humidity measurements

17
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:38,707
like in soil.

18
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:41,415
Now there are two key steps to getting accurate

19
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,750
oxygen measurements.

20
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,625
First we're gonna talk about calibrating the sensor,

21
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:48,875
both the standalone sensor and an handheld meter,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,582
and then we'll talk about correcting those test measurements

23
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:53,332
to get your final measurement.

24
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:56,082
This is where things can get a little more complicated

25
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:57,790
depending on your level of need.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,790
All these instructions and formulas

27
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,832
can be found in the Apogee Instruments

28
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,707
Oxygen Sensor user manual.

29
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,250
Alright, let's get started.

30
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,957
For the stand alone sensor

31
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:08,540
you're gonna need a few things.

32
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:10,375
You'll need your oxygen sensor.

33
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:14,625
A multimeter or a data logger.

34
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:16,790
A calibration spreadsheet.

35
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,875
Which is available at ApogeeInstruments.com

36
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,750
or by clicking the description below

37
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,290
or there should be a link right here.

38
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,915
Lastly you're gonna need your calibration locations

39
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:29,415
altitude or pressure, humidity and temperature.

40
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:29,832
These are

41
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:32,082
typically available from your local weather station.

42
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:34,957
Your calibration should be performed outdoors

43
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:37,875
in an open air environment near your test site.

44
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:40,165
It needs to be calibrated outside.

45
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,290
Whether you're at sea level or on top of Mount Everest

46
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,665
the oxygen concentration will be the same.

47
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:48,540
It's always gonna be 20.95%.

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,207
As soon as you go inside

49
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:53,332
that oxygen concentration number can begin to vary.

50
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:55,582
Make sure that as you're calibrating the sensor

51
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,165
you also do an environment that doesn't have wind.

52
00:01:58,207 --> 00:01:59,832
Wind running across the port

53
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:01,582
can cause different pressure changes

54
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,165
making your calibration off.

55
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,915
So make sure you're outside

56
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:06,582
in a location that's not windy.

57
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,540
Okay, now we're gonna calibrate our standalone sensor.

58
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:12,332
First we'll make sure that the sensor is upright

59
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,540
or that the measuring port is pointing down.

60
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,125
By pointing the sensor down

61
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,125
it gives us the strongest signal

62
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,415
the least amount of noise.

63
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,332
Then we'll take our multimeter

64
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:27,790
and measured the black and the white wires.

65
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,082
We wanna make sure that the black

66
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:31,540
and the wires don't touch,

67
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,790
because as the oxygen sensor is taking measurements

68
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,250
it produces a signal

69
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,415
which could cause problems and short things out

70
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:39,415
if they were to touch.

71
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,625
We'll clip on it both of these wires

72
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:43,207
and after a couple seconds

73
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:43,832
you should see that

74
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,707
the voltage will start to level out.

75
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,165
As we wait for a second

76
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:50,040
you'll see it's kind of hovering around

77
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,665
45.1, 45.0  even. This is the number that we wanna remember.

78
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:56,875
We're gonna use that and plug it into the spreadsheet.

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,832
But before we do,

80
00:02:57,832 --> 00:03:00,082
we're gonna calibrate the handheld meter.

81
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,625
To calibrate the handheld meter

82
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,457
we want to do the same thing.

83
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,082
Make sure that it's pointing down.

84
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,707
We'll turn on the meter.

85
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,040
We'll press the mode button twice.

86
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,875
You'll see "Run" start to flash

87
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,375
and then we'll press the sample

88
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,040
and the mode button at the same time.

89
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:26,000
You'll then see the screen flash "CAL" as it's calibrating.

90
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,375
Then it'll be done and it's ready to go.

91
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,750
You can calibrate the meter as often as necessary.

92
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,750
Just make sure that you're outside when you do it.

93
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,415
That's the most important part.

94
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,790
Alright now,

95
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,875
let's go back inside

96
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,165
and plug that mill of volt number into the spreadsheet

97
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:42,582
and get our calibration factor.

98
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:44,125
Now that we have that value

99
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,625
let's open up the spreadsheet.

100
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,290
As always

101
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,040
you can check in description below for that link.

102
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,915
First, we'll select our sensor model.

103
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,540
If you notice that things aren't working

104
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,000
make sure you enable editing.

105
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,125
Enter that recorded voltage.

106
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,707
Then enter the calibration locations temperature

107
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,040
humidity and elevation.

108
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,125
Then at the bottom

109
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,665
it will give you that multiplier and the offset.

110
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,540
You can use this sample info

111
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,082
section to make environmental corrections

112
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,458
to data points that you had previously taken.

113
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,750
Your sensor is now calibrated

114
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,083
and now you have a basic linear equation

115
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,208
to begin taking measurement

116
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,332
of relative oxygen concentration.

117
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,040
This will provide good

118
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
relative oxygen concentration data.

119
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,041
Now for better data. If you

120
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,207
take the sensor outside and measure the oxygen outside

121
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,958
you should see a straight line

122
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,541
because it's always gonna be 20.95.

123
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,082
The problem is if you actually did that

124
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,415
you start to see these waves start to occur.

125
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,457
That's gonna come from the barometric pressure.

126
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:04,750
The concentration is still 20.95%

127
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,415
the difference is the amount of air is changing.

128
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,583
So we need to account for the barometric pressure.

129
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,333
If you use equation like this,

130
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,208
it's going to include the barometric pressure

131
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,833
and then it's gonna calibrate it

132
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,125
so that way you don't have these swings.

133
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,833
Humidity and temperature

134
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,000
are going to put some noise into your readings

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,458
so if you want the best data

136
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,625
then in your measurements

137
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,583
you need to include these equations

138
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,666
so that way you can offset the temperature

139
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,915
the humidity and the meriometric pressure

140
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,041
if you account for those and barometric pressure

141
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,207
then you're gonna have the best data

142
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,082
if you plan on taking measurements in a high humidity

143
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,750
environment such as soil

144
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,915
then it's ideal to calibrate the sensor

145
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:49,582
in a location where the relative humidity is also 100%

146
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,041
a simple way to do this is by mounting the sensor

147
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,415
in a sealed chamber over water

148
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:56,750
with ambient air filling the headspace

149
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,333
first we're gonna create my little chamber here

150
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,541
let's go inside I'll show you how to make that chamber

151
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,416
we're gonna make a high humidity

152
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,041
calibration chamber for our oxygen sensor

153
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,541
in the end the sensor is gonna mount to the top

154
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,415
of the container

155
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,666
and kind of be mounted and oriented vertically

156
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,375
where we will fill this with some sort of humid

157
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,083
material and then we will do the calibration

158
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,958
so we'll do is we'll just take the lid off this guy

159
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,250
we'll take a little ceiling lock nut

160
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,125
that goes with that oxygen sensor

161
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:30,582
we'll trace the inside of it

162
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,708
and we'll know that we just need to make the hole

163
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,375
slightly larger than that

164
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,791
so very carefully we'll cut this hole out

165
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,708
make sure you don't hurt yourself

166
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,625
cause that would be bad as always

167
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:50,832
let's get start together

168
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,207
we wanna make sure this hole is as close to round as we

169
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,458
can because we don't want air pressure to get out

170
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,791
or humidity to get out or air pressure

171
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,582
I guess air pressure getting in isn't too bad if we're outside

172
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,125
but really

173
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,208
we just wanna keep that humidity as high as we can

174
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,583
get it so we will cut this center part out

175
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,332
and there's always a chance that we might have to go

176
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,250
and make it a little bit bigger test fit the sensor

177
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,207
yeah that'll work so it's nice

178
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:24,291
it's tight but we want to be tight so take that

179
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:32,415
put our sealing ring above that

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,250
then we'll screw

181
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,665
the nut on top of that

182
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,375
so really we should have a good

183
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,790
a good connection between the oxygen sensor

184
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,083
and our high humidity

185
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,458
chamber

186
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,166
now you've made that chamber

187
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,165
we just need to create that humid environment

188
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,165
so what I'm gonna do is

189
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:58,707
I'm gonna put some warm water in this container

190
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,457
I put some tip paper towels in it

191
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,416
so that it doesn't swash around so much

192
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,457
you don't want water coming in contact

193
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,208
with the sensor itself so I used paper towels

194
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,500
you can use a sponge

195
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,958
and then I've gotten some warm water

196
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:15,750
you can also just leave water out in the sun

197
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,333
it just has to be a warm environment

198
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,000
and then

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,540
we just wanna make sure that the air pressure is

200
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,915
equalized between the sky and our container

201
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,583
we'll close this on top

202
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,333
and then we'll wait for just a few minutes

203
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,833
for the humidity to build up in it

204
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,458
once the humidity has built up

205
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,083
we're gonna do the same thing as we did before

206
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,541
we're gonna connect our voltage meter

207
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,958
and read that voltage between the white and the black

208
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,541
wait for a few seconds for that voltage to settle

209
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,957
we're gonna do the same thing as we did before

210
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:42,915
but this is gonna be the number that we're gonna use

211
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,541
just wanna make sure that you calibrate it

212
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,375
in environment that's high humidity

213
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,332
as close to 100% as you can get

214
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:50,332
just make sure that as you're sealing it

215
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:52,915
that you're outside when you seal it that way

216
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,875
the air pressures are equal

217
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,332
and it has that 20.95% in the container

218
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,000
when you close it

219
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,332
there you have it

220
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,333
you should have all the information that you

221
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,040
need to take high quality

222
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,791
oxygen concentration measurements

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,291
for any more questions

224
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,500
please refer to the sensors user manual

225
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,416
or contact the support team at Apogee Instruments

226
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,707
also leave any questions that you might have

227
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,165
in the comment section below

228
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,666
thank you so much for watching and happy measuring
