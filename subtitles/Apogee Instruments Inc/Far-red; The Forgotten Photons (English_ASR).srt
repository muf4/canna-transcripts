1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,839
I'm Bruce Bugbee professor of crop

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:10,109
physiology at Utah State University and

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,929
also president of Apogee instruments I'm

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:17,850
here today at the apogee instrument

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:22,500
studio to talk about our recent research

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:26,630
on far-red photon effects on plant

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,990
growth and development this is a

8
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:33,738
emerging field that's red hot right now

9
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:37,769
companies are putting far red LEDs into

10
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:40,049
fixtures and it's based on our work and

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,890
that of some other laboratories that

12
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,269
have clearly shown some value of far red

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,719
so in this seminar

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:53,609
I'm calling this far red The Forgotten

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,969
photons we can't see them they're barely

16
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:59,429
visible to the human eye and yet they

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,489
have powerful effects on plant growth

18
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,409
that we're just discovering we missed

19
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,530
these effects for so many years because

20
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,320
the electric lights don't have far red

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,478
there's no reason to put them in there

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:17,000
sunlight is loaded with par red photons

23
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:21,450
but it wasn't until we got LEDs and

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,359
especially afar red LED that's very

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,680
efficient that can be added to electric

26
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:31,319
lights so this work is both fascinating

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,250
from the standpoint of fundamental photo

28
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:37,109
biology and also has immediate

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,519
significant commercial implications

30
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,438
because we can manipulate both

31
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:47,489
photosynthesis and plant shape with

32
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,709
these four red photons so I'd love to

33
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,509
show this prism breaking up the colors

34
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,959
of light those of you know Pink Floyd

35
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,019
you know order this came from so the far

36
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,578
red I likes to show this it's right on

37
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,629
this edge right here of just the edge of

38
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:06,328
visible light and that's what we're

39
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:09,090
gonna talk about in this I want to

40
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:11,489
acknowledge two of my colleagues that

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,780
have done this research they're in the

42
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,060
trenches day-to-day

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,159
making the measurements and every we

44
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,580
meet every single day discuss the data

45
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,340
what the next studies were gonna do the

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,709
first one is Xu Jung Jen who was a

47
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,430
started as a postdoc she's now a

48
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:32,129
research scientist in the lab she has

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,800
done the measurements on photosynthesis

50
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,530
and especially canopy photosynthesis and

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,239
then also Paul Kazuma who came to us

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,719
from the University of Florida

53
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,200
Kevin Voltas lab there he's done the

54
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:51,289
research on plant shape from far red

55
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:54,359
photons our work has been funded by

56
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,789
primarily by NASA they've funded the lab

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,640
for over 30 years for some very basic

58
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:02,280
studies and now more recently the USDA

59
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,469
has funded our research through what's

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,739
called the lamp project lighting

61
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:10,709
approaches to maximize profits basic

62
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,780
funding agency applied funding agency

63
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,599
and the interaction between those has

64
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,169
really helped us understand the value of

65
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,639
far-red photons let me show you another

66
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:26,159
graph of where the far red photons lie

67
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,129
here's the colors of light all the way

68
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,489
from blue to far red and you can see

69
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,060
let's put some dotted lines on here the

70
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,789
cut-offs

71
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,939
now our traditional definition of

72
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:43,679
photosynthesis doesn't start counting

73
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:46,949
photons until that's it's um black until

74
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,510
right here right at 400 we start

75
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,639
counting them we have evidence these

76
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:53,370
photons are useful too but for now we're

77
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,458
going to talk about just the far red so

78
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,890
right here on the edge of our vision

79
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:01,620
we're talking about these photons right

80
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,399
in this area right here what's the

81
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,789
effect on plant growth just to review we

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:14,930
typically break up light into three

83
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:14,929
categories blue green

84
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,910
and read and I'll be talking about the

85
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:25,100
effects of those it turns out this is

86
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,370
these are hundred nanometer increments

87
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,520
but it really works well to break them

88
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,829
up into this we're currently studying

89
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,418
different wavelengths of blue but the

90
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:37,879
green that could look at the green

91
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:39,978
includes yellow transitioning to orange

92
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,288
we call that whole thing green but it

93
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:46,069
turns out it works really well to break

94
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:48,349
the light up into this so what I'm going

95
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:51,620
to start with is a story and it's a

96
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:55,189
story of a study that you young did with

97
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,709
four growth chambers where we did canopy

98
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:59,389
photosynthesis on the plants and gave

99
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:02,329
them different colors of light so let's

100
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:05,509
go to that story here's the four

101
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:10,459
chambers two of them had white light

102
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:15,310
from white LEDs two of them had magenta

103
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:21,589
or purple light from red and blue LEDs

104
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:26,030
here is the input of photons to each 300

105
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:30,560
350 300 350 so if we looked at this

106
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:34,609
chart without prior knowledge of for red

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,519
photons how would you say the lettuce

108
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,199
grew this is a study with lettuce the

109
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:45,319
first thing you'd say let's see if we

110
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:47,780
control this in red is that these by

111
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,939
virtue of having higher light would have

112
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:55,698
higher yield and these would be less and

113
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:59,180
if you were a believer in red and blue

114
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:02,000
photons for photosynthesis you would say

115
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,400
that this would grow the best and this

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,728
would be second and these would be third

117
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:12,560
and fourth now let's look how that data

118
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:16,759
comes out for this these two were

119
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,280
exactly equal now I've normalized the

120
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,110
fresh weight and the dry weight to a

121
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,859
hundred for these to make the point

122
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:29,030
there was no difference in growth when

123
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,490
we went from purple or magenta light to

124
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:33,829
like that should not be a surprise

125
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,160
because now we know that green photons

126
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:39,889
are just as good as any other color for

127
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,800
photosynthesis and I'm going to discuss

128
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:47,149
that more in a bit let's take a look

129
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:52,280
just at those two chambers and and the

130
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:55,129
difference these two chambers grew even

131
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:59,000
better in this experiment so suddenly

132
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:01,670
look at the difference 27% better 35%

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,769
better this is just opposite of our

134
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,870
intuition where we thought this would be

135
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:09,889
the best and this would be the worst

136
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:12,019
it's completely flipped let's take a

137
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,419
look at what's going on here is there a

138
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,829
mechanism for why this should be the

139
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,650
best and that and grew better than that

140
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:25,159
what I didn't tell you is that these two

141
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:27,919
chambers had 50 micro moles per meter

142
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,930
squared per second of far-red photons

143
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:38,270
that's a big deal so 350 300 plus 50

144
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:42,439
this got 350 the total here is 350 all

145
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:47,719
four chambers had the exact same photon

146
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:49,969
flux if you count the far red photons so

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,910
what's up with that too far red photons

148
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,460
caused photosynthesis let's take a look

149
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:59,270
at this first let's take a look at these

150
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:02,060
two chambers is this right do white

151
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:04,459
lights grow plants equally well to

152
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,040
magenta lights with a long history of

153
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:09,319
now of people saying pink houses with

154
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,290
this blue people said this is a plant

155
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,480
growth light this is not efficient for

156
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,879
photosynthesis because the green photons

157
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:24,890
just bounce off let's take a look at

158
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:29,420
that this is a 2002 edition of the plant

159
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:32,569
physiology book that I use in class what

160
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:37,070
does this book say about red and blue

161
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:39,470
and green light 2002 that's 17 years ago

162
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,740
here's the graph here's what it says

163
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:46,040
this is a absorption of chlorophyll

164
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,259
really strong absorption and blue lessen

165
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,779
the green strong absorption in the red

166
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:53,809
says chlorophyll absorbs minimum green

167
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:56,419
light that's proof statement and that

168
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:58,069
resulted in people making lights with

169
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:02,389
just red and blue because of this

170
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:05,480
powerful absorption by chlorophyll but

171
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:08,120
sunlight is loaded with green light is

172
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,710
that really wasted that's jump ahead to

173
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,840
the 2015 version of this book which is

174
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:18,740
the current version this is Tyson's

175
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,710
Eiger now it's on the sixth edition now

176
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,200
we turn to the exact same page of

177
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:27,139
chlorophyll look at this graph there's

178
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,750
new pigments in here and then now it

179
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:33,319
says multiple pigments absorb radiation

180
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,090
from 400 to 700 now this is still a

181
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,900
little misleading because this pigment

182
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:41,000
fighter Ethan is only found in algae but

183
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:43,000
the chlorophyll absorption even though

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,639
it's low and here on this graph is

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,480
enough to penetrate the leaves and cause

186
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:54,529
excellent photosynthesis so what I'd

187
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,560
like to show you briefly is the effects

188
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:00,589
of these colors of light this summarizes

189
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,119
a big part of my career to categorize

190
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,420
these remember we have blue green red

191
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,409
and now far read summary of spectral

192
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:12,679
effects here's our Dark Side of the Moon

193
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:15,919
spectra blue photons inhibit cell

194
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,259
expansion that sounds terrible but when

195
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:22,599
it's stem elongation it's a good thing

196
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:25,490
more blue shorter plants and that's

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,610
tremendous now if it's smaller leaves

198
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:32,299
that's bad but that's the most

199
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,970
fundamental effect of blue photons is to

200
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:38,779
inhibit stem elongation but they also

201
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,519
inhibit leaf expansion green are far

202
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,339
more valuable than we once thought

203
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:46,939
because they are very effective for

204
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:49,629
photosynthesis and they facilitate human

205
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:55,250
vision let's go to this slide right here

206
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:56,639
this is cannabis grown under red and

207
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,179
blue LEDs and

208
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,189
white LEDs our experience working in the

209
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:05,399
lab is that these are tremendously

210
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,529
valuable for diagnosing the plants get

211
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,409
in there to see microscopic insects

212
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:12,720
subtle nutritional disorders they

213
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:16,199
penetrate deep in the canopy we can see

214
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,950
these dark areas this is very difficult

215
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,170
to understand the health of the plants

216
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:25,170
now you can turn those off and turn on

217
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:27,599
whites but you don't see surgeons

218
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:29,969
working under dim white light they have

219
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,360
bright white light in we have found that

220
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:37,620
really helps diagnose subtle disorders

221
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:41,339
on the plants this is still slightly

222
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,889
more efficient electrically and but the

223
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:47,700
difference is getting smaller this is

224
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:49,769
maybe 10% more of electrically efficient

225
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,410
than this but this has the clear

226
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:55,620
advantage for being able to diagnose the

227
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:58,110
plants this is a little sidebar from our

228
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,799
from our quest to understand far red

229
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:05,759
photons but it's an important sidebar

230
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:08,059
back to this inhibit cell expansion look

231
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,879
at far red photons Wow

232
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:15,000
they do the opposite of blue they

233
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:18,809
enhance cell expansion and that effect

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,360
is so powerful here sit Elliot lettuce

235
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:25,379
with white light with no far red and

236
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,289
with 10% far red now I just jumped ahead

237
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:31,679
of myself to show you what's going on in

238
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:33,778
our study with those far red photons but

239
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,039
this enhancement of cell expansion is a

240
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:40,169
very big thing it's a very powerful tool

241
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:43,198
look at how well photons penetrate

242
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:46,049
leaves this is a beautiful study by

243
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:49,198
Brodus inand Vogelman 2010 they looked

244
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:51,389
at a side view of a leaf here's blue

245
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:53,639
there's so much absorption by

246
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:55,799
chlorophyll it doesn't penetrate here's

247
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,659
green penetrates the whole leaf there's

248
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,479
the top of the leaf then we get a green

249
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,219
color here there's the top of the leaf

250
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,519
right there here's the bottom of the

251
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,860
leaf green beautifully penetrates the

252
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,419
leaf through the spongy mesophyll all

253
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,940
the way through the leaf that's a big

254
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:12,849
Valley

255
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,130
of green light red similar to blue

256
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,230
absorbed by chlorophyll absorbed in the

257
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:20,259
top layers look at far red that also

258
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:23,259
penetrates the leaf so these effects

259
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:25,870
only become apparent when we study whole

260
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:28,809
plants and especially plant communities

261
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,690
but this is a nice slide showing the

262
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:36,639
penetrating effects of these colors of

263
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:39,430
light back to our study better growth

264
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:45,069
here better growth here what caused that

265
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:47,620
better growth when we get a result like

266
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,110
this that's sort of unbelievable because

267
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,409
if these don't cause photosynthesis

268
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:57,340
what's going on we need to know the

269
00:13:53,409 --> 00:14:00,100
mechanism and this by the way this is

270
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,320
fresh mass and dry mass both in this

271
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,090
study we very carefully measure this

272
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,770
we've done it more than once we get the

273
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:12,639
same result now let's go back to Carl

274
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:14,470
Sagan who popularized a phrase that I

275
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,870
think all of us would be good to

276
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,620
remember when we're doing these studies

277
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,259
extraordinary claims require

278
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,279
extraordinary proof with waar red

279
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,490
enhances lettuce growth we need

280
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:35,860
extraordinary proof to begin to

281
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:39,340
understand it so this comes from first

282
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,009
of all the Makri curve there's a picture

283
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:46,769
of Keith McCree he died five years ago

284
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:49,779
here's his famous curve here's 700 and

285
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:52,659
in the Makri curve he shows these

286
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:57,279
cutting off so fast that these photons

287
00:14:52,659 --> 00:15:00,309
are of minimal value but as terrific as

288
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,889
a scientist as McCree was and I got to

289
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:05,949
know him personally early in my career I

290
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:10,889
he was a physicist that came across to

291
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:15,430
help biology is a great guy he only had

292
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:18,850
primitive tools to make this curve he

293
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:22,750
didn't have the LEDs we have now he had

294
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,500
prisms and filters so we had low light

295
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,899
levels

296
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,419
and he only could study one color at a

297
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,000
time and on a single leaf

298
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:34,809
it's a terrific piece of work and his

299
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,879
papers are a masterpiece of writing but

300
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:40,329
they're limited because he couldn't

301
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:44,500
study synergistic effects of multiple

302
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,650
colors of light at once on the leaf so

303
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:52,440
let's look at what happens

304
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:56,799
there's our far-red this is a diagram of

305
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,890
what happens with photons flowing

306
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,919
through the light reactions of

307
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:06,279
photosynthesis now usually this is shown

308
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:10,449
with a lot of biochemistry but I really

309
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:14,970
like physical diagrams so here's a

310
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:18,210
person it's a man wife team I guess

311
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:23,680
moving photons through what we call

312
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:28,120
photosystem 1 and photosystem 2 they

313
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:31,209
first come in it takes 4 photons to

314
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,490
excite this these four electrons to a

315
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:36,730
higher energy state this is where water

316
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,740
is split in photosynthesis now they get

317
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:44,170
this photon roll it down this platform

318
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:46,570
and this male turns and it makes ATP so

319
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:49,449
if that's that's a first step really

320
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:52,720
valuable now they get to with another

321
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,230
platform and we need four more photons

322
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,410
to excite four electrons up here to this

323
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,930
guy there's four electrons in a very

324
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:04,599
high state and now we put them in a

325
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:08,169
bucket and this makes NADPH so the

326
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:10,769
combination of ATP and NADPH very

327
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,390
high-energy compounds are what causes

328
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:15,690
photosynthesis interesting enough

329
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:19,000
because of the way we discover these

330
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:21,460
photosystem two comes first and then

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,089
photosystem one that's a trick question

332
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:29,019
for a students on plant physiology exams

333
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:33,309
2 comes first however we have known

334
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:36,139
since the 1950s and the time of Emerson

335
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:40,210
that far red vote

336
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:43,250
guns also are effective right here and

337
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,250
it in fact that work helped us

338
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:50,420
understand there's two photosystems so

339
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:52,910
the far red photons can substitute for

340
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:58,039
the traditionally photosynthetic photons

341
00:17:52,910 --> 00:18:00,740
here but only if we have we'll call it

342
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,869
white light photons on this side far red

343
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,289
photons all by themselves are not

344
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:08,379
effective we know that they but it's

345
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,609
easy to give our red photon

346
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,120
synergistically with all the rest of the

347
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:17,089
photons so this is a nice easy to

348
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,399
remember diagram of how photons turn

349
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:23,299
into energy and then all this energy is

350
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,440
used to fix co2 into sucrose in plants

351
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:29,629
but the point is far bit photons now

352
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,390
there's a very fundamental law that

353
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,900
underlies all of this and this law

354
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,840
relates not only to photosynthesis but

355
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,570
it relates to solar panels and for that

356
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:46,339
matter it relates to human vision in our

357
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:49,279
the retina of our eyes and that law this

358
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:52,990
is the Emerson enhancement effect this

359
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:56,809
law is called the stark Einstein law

360
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:59,299
this stark helped explain Einstein's

361
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:03,319
work they both get credit for it and

362
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:06,740
here it is 1 photon excites one electron

363
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,929
a simple law we have forked photons here

364
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,259
we get four electrons here

365
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:15,500
four more photons here we get four more

366
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:17,240
electrons up there that's a remarkable

367
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,200
law and it links the photosynthetic

368
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,039
value of photons to human vision and to

369
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,990
solar cells and really all of biology

370
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,690
this is how the system works and this is

371
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,089
why far red photons can act

372
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:37,220
synergistically with white now let's

373
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:39,619
take a closer look at this is our

374
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:43,100
definition of photosynthetic photons

375
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:45,319
correct to do this work we put lettuce

376
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:48,259
and those gas exchange chambers that I

377
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,369
talked about and gave them supplemental

378
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,319
far red light

379
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:53,808
this is just exactly how we did this

380
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:56,388
study we're talking about here's their

381
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:59,298
traditional photons here's the far red

382
00:19:56,388 --> 00:20:01,849
right there we normally wouldn't count

383
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:06,668
them for photosynthesis what happened

384
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:11,058
this is 400 to 700 there's the far red

385
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:12,470
when we gave them only white light we

386
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:14,019
get this kind of curve for

387
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,839
photosynthesis this is gross

388
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:20,149
photosynthesis as a curve that slightly

389
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,819
nonlinear because we're getting up to

390
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:25,189
high light levels now we start adding

391
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:29,689
far red photons to this what happens

392
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:31,580
well look at this they go up we're not

393
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,038
counting them but they made

394
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:36,648
photosynthesis go up and we're not we're

395
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,759
not counting them as photosynthetic how

396
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:41,288
do you explain that

397
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:45,490
we need another graph here is the graph

398
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:49,220
where we count photons all the way to

399
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,509
750 and now those photons fall perfectly

400
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,839
on the line

401
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:56,298
this is powerful evidence that our

402
00:20:53,839 --> 00:21:01,990
definition of photosynthetic photons

403
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:05,148
needs revision to count for red photons

404
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,339
particularly in canopy photosynthesis

405
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:09,589
where they penetrate the canopy and they

406
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:13,490
have a bigger effect than they might

407
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:18,439
have in a single leaf let's take a look

408
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:21,740
now at does this happen in all species

409
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,259
remember we want convincing evidence we

410
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,440
want extraordinary proof may be that

411
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:30,288
only works in lettuce Xu yung Chen has

412
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,619
now done this in something like 20

413
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:36,349
species spinach basil kale different

414
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:40,579
kinds of lettuce c4 crops like corn

415
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:44,240
sunflower wheat it happens the same in

416
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:47,118
every species every single species those

417
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,099
far-red photons are equally valuable to

418
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:51,099
traditionally photosynthetic photons

419
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,630
here's the commercial implications we

420
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:03,049
did a paper last end of last year it got

421
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:05,900
published in the journal Nature most

422
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:08,779
people show that flux of photons like

423
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:13,790
this in an energy basis and here's

424
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:16,490
far-red right here not very good but

425
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:18,829
energy doesn't cause photosynthesis

426
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:23,059
energy doesn't cause plant shape

427
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:25,730
it's photons and these are low energy

428
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:29,149
photons so when we take this data and

429
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:32,660
rege RAF it for photon flux look at this

430
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:35,210
the far red photons are almost equal to

431
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,700
the Reds and the Blues these violets are

432
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,490
coming on fast - that's a subject of

433
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,799
another talk but the far red photons are

434
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,079
very effective so now we can use those

435
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,819
commercially not only can we use them

436
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:50,449
for photo biology but we can use them

437
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:53,000
commercially to manipulate plants back

438
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,039
to the study now this shows if they're

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,069
photosynthetic this shows why these

440
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,839
should all be equal because they cause

441
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:02,740
photosynthesis but they weren't equal

442
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:07,849
these two are even better than those two

443
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:12,039
this gets us in to plant shape this is

444
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:16,129
Paul kazuma's work now and this is the

445
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:19,629
responsive plants to shade when the

446
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:22,790
plants are in the bright Sun they have

447
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:26,180
plenty of visible photons blue green and

448
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:29,359
red they know they're in the Sun but

449
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:33,289
when they're in the shade over here

450
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:36,589
underneath this tree they have a lot of

451
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:39,920
far red photons this is the graph of the

452
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:43,429
shade they're very enriched when plants

453
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,210
perceive a high amount of far-red they

454
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,060
panic

455
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,090
we're under shade they need to do one of

456
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:53,119
two things get tall fast to get into the

457
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:56,689
light or get bigger to capture more

458
00:23:53,119 --> 00:24:00,709
light so there's two types of plants

459
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:03,920
here they come once growing fast this is

460
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,210
called a shade avoider plant because

461
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,700
it's getting tall

462
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:11,390
this plant is called the shade tolerator

463
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,940
plant because it's getting big if we can

464
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,860
trick plants that are not in the shade

465
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,140
to think that we could make them like

466
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:21,199
this this is a traditional plant in the

467
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:24,110
Sun this is exactly what happens with

468
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,279
lettuce that the lettuce gets big like

469
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:31,459
this because of its being tricked by far

470
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:37,279
red photons let's take a look at this

471
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:40,190
shade avoidance shade tolerance there's

472
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:44,660
a big picture of that lettuce and the

473
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:46,700
value of far-red this was with just a

474
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,620
little bit more far-red we tricked this

475
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,460
lettuce plant into thinking it was in

476
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:56,389
the shade it got enormous this is a

477
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:59,090
powerful picture we're all anxious to

478
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,120
use far-red for indoor agriculture -

479
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:04,730
unless to get the plants bigger and many

480
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,229
people have said this is incredible

481
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:11,710
we're going to meet we need to be giving

482
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:17,450
far-red to everything but remember that

483
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:23,329
far-red also increases stem elongation

484
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:26,600
and some plants could be shade avoiders

485
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:30,079
let's look at what the results from

486
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:34,009
multiple species here's here's a top

487
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,109
view of these plants no far red far it's

488
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:38,750
the same slide as the last known only

489
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:41,529
shows you that the dramatic benefit of

490
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,849
red photons both because of

491
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:46,940
photosynthesis and because of expansion

492
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:49,119
but look the photosynthetic photons were

493
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,500
less so we needed those for

494
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,769
photosynthesis but they not only grew

495
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:57,980
equally they grew better here's the

496
00:25:54,769 --> 00:26:00,200
problem we give the same amount of fire

497
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,960
red photons to Tomatoes look what

498
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:07,220
happens more stem elongation this is

499
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,840
very undesirable in tomatoes I know we

500
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,400
don't grow soybeans in controlled

501
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,209
environments but there are a great test

502
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,970
species

503
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,000
it made soybeans panic they get tall

504
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,680
this is not a good effect

505
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,960
cucumbers makes cucumbers tallest

506
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,240
not a good effect spinach we have some

507
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,299
evidence as leafy greens this can help

508
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,359
with leaf expansion in spinach too so

509
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:32,210
for leafy greens the addition of ferret

510
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:35,119
is great but it's a powerful tool

511
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,950
because we could use it a little bit

512
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,750
when the plants are young we can use it

513
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,880
at different times look at this flower

514
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:45,250
right there let me see if I can

515
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:48,020
highlight this we'll put that one in red

516
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:52,640
there's evidence that far red light can

517
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:55,639
help plants form flower sooner so I hope

518
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,310
this seminars helped explain from our

519
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:02,509
results the tremendous value of far red

520
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:04,970
photons so historically we have quantum

521
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:08,450
sensors to measure photosynthetic

522
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:11,420
photons but those quantum sensors don't

523
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,299
measure this far red in order to measure

524
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:17,480
it you need a spectral radiometer which

525
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:20,659
is terrific but that jumps up the price

526
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,620
and complexity considerably in making

527
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:28,400
those measurements because of this

528
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:32,299
Apogee has developed a sensor that has

529
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:37,300
both red and far-red detectors in the

530
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:39,230
same sensor so this helps us measure

531
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:41,509
Photosynth that traditional in

532
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:47,390
photosynthetic photons and in a separate

533
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:49,819
measurement for red photons that's it

534
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,960
thanks for listening we'll talk to you

535
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:52,960
again in another video
