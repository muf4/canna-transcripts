1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
well my name is Skyler Smith here at

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,048
Apogee instruments and today we're going

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,808
to talk about how to wire up the St 150

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,570
ambient air temperature sensor the CS

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,449
240 back of panel module temperature

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,940
sensor and the TS 100 aspirated

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,879
radiation shield to the SMA cluster

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,189
controller all these components are part

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,169
of our pv 100 monitoring package from

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,948
Apogee instruments which also includes

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,279
the pyrometer

12
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,080
the SP 214 which is part of a different

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,850
wiring video and so if you're looking

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,308
for wiring instructions on that just

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,800
click on the comments below and then you

16
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:42,030
can find that video so let's start with

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,949
the CS 240 and this is what the back of

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,359
module temperature sensor looks like

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,670
right there's got a little bit of

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,710
adhesive and then it will also come with

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,800
some captain tape to be able to mount

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,299
that on the back of your panel so the

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:01:00,899
wiring for this it comes with seven

24
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:03,569
conductors here to black to red to white

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,219
and a shield for our application

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,079
connecting to the SMA cluster controller

27
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,239
we'll just go ahead and bend down the

28
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,950
black conductors because we don't need

29
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,009
them so I mean if you want to trim them

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,820
off whatever your needs are so we'll

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,600
start with the shield and we're going to

32
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:23,758
be working on terminal x seven down here

33
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,489
we're going to start on row B which is

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,000
the bottom one and so the first terminal

35
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:32,819
here is going to be the shield and then

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,009
the next one is going to be the white

37
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,478
conductor and it actually doesn't matter

38
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,728
which white conductor you can choose

39
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,219
either and then the next one is going to

40
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:44,368
be a red conductor and again it doesn't

41
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,849
matter you can choose either then we can

42
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:51,750
choose the other white conductor that

43
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:56,759
goes in the fourth one and then the last

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:59,280
one is the other red now the way we can

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,540
check our self here is if our cluster

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,180
controller is powered up we can just

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,229
push down until we get to meteorology

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,060
and then we can see our second one says

49
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,310
module temperature and it's giving us a

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,110
reading right now and it is it looks

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,770
like an accurate reading so we know that

52
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,230
that is why

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,450
up correctly now we're going to talk

54
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,549
about the SP 150 and be an air

55
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:24,109
temperature sensor and this is what it

56
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,450
looks like you can see our class a PRT

57
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,240
so we'll just slide that back into the

58
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:32,789
TS 100 shield there if you do order the

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,860
pv 100 package it will come already pre

60
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:38,429
glued into the port that goes in the

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,650
side of the TS 100 shield so this one

62
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,030
comes with 5 conductors comes with a

63
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,950
shield a red a black a green and a white

64
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,550
and we'll just be using all five of

65
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:53,179
these conductors so we're now on x7 row

66
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,920
a so we're going to start right here and

67
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,770
we're going to put the shield in first

68
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,780
in the first terminal the second one is

69
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,780
going to be the white conductor

70
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,019
the next one is going to be the black

71
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,019
conductor

72
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:23,810
then we have the green conductor into

73
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:29,900
the fourth terminal there and then we

74
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:31,878
have the red conductor and again once

75
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,400
that's all connected we can just scroll

76
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,560
down here and we can see our ambient

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,289
temperature and it is giving us a

78
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,199
believable reading last thing we need to

79
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:43,909
do today is power the fan on our cs100

80
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,679
and it's really important to use an

81
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:47,780
active shield when you're taking you to

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,360
ambient air temperature measurements and

83
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,669
we have on our other video the pv 100

84
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,069
video some graphs that show the data we

85
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:57,859
collected on active radiation shields

86
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,598
versus those passive shields so to power

87
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,930
the fan on this it needs the 12 volt

88
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:05,359
power supply included in the pv 100 is

89
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,599
this little DC to DC converter that

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,260
takes 24 volts DC which is also already

91
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:17,750
available and converts it to 12 volts so

92
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:21,439
the conductors from the TS 100 there are

93
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,089
seven of them we can bend down all but

94
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,649
the red in the black we only need the

95
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:28,459
red and the black for our application

96
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:30,799
and then so connected already to the

97
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:34,250
converter is the 24 volts powered off

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,689
the 24 24 volt power supply so we will

99
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:42,788
go ahead and the middle one here we will

100
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:42,788
connect the black conductor to

101
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:55,409
and then the one on the end will be our

102
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:58,090
read to power up to 12 volts on the fan

103
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,540
and as we slide him in and tighten them

104
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:03,759
down we can hear the fan we can also

105
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,900
fill the air coming off the fan and we

106
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,389
know we're getting those accurate

107
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:09,069
ambient air temperature measurements

108
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,409
thank you very much for watching how to

109
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:14,290
wire up the st 150 ambient air

110
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,720
temperature sensor the CS 240 back of

111
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,060
panel module temperature sensor and then

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,950
powering the TS 100 aspirated radiation

113
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,420
shield if you have any questions feel

114
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,099
free to leave them in the comments below

115
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,100
thank you very much for watching

116
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,899
