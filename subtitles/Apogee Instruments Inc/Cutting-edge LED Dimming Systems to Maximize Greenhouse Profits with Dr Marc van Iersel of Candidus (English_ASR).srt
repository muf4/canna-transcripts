1
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,519
well hello

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,919
um I am Mike fan esol and my daytime job

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,660
I am a professor in the department of

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,539
horticulture at the University of

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,740
Georgia where I do a lot of research on

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,858
lighting and control environment

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,859
agriculture much of that research is

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,020
funded by the USDA through a project

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,000
that is called lighting approaches to

10
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:28,379
maximize profits profits and short lamp

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,618
in addition to my job at the University

12
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,839
of Georgia I also have a company that

13
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:37,500
focuses on making lighting control

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,719
systems for control that environment

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,780
agricultural facilities both greenhouses

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,899
and vertical farms and that company is

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,899
called candidas and typically I try to

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,640
keep my academic and Company

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,679
presentation separate from each other

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
but hopefully as we go through this

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,840
presentation you will see why in this

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,600
case it's relevant to actually combine

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,760
the two into one presentation so what I

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,400
want to talk about today is how we can

25
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,560
optimize lighting and control the

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,320
environment Agriculture and the reason

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,180
that that is important is because in

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,519
control environment Agriculture and

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,580
again this refers to plant factories or

30
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,519
vertical Farms as well as greenhouses

31
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:23,359
lighting is necessary but it also tends

32
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,579
to be very expensive and specifically

33
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,739
lighting typically is the second most

34
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,739
expensive thing in these facilities

35
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:34,739
after Labor and because of that expense

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,359
good control over how you provide that

37
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,938
lighting can actually make the

38
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,700
difference between being profitable

39
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,679
versus losing money so I'm not going to

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,379
provide a whole lot of background I want

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
to jump right into what we have been

42
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,118
doing from a research perspective and

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,199
how we then try to apply that in the

44
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,719
industry

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,060
so when we think about optimizing

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,618
supplemental lighting the first thing

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,159
that I think about as a plant

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:05,399
physiologist is studying how plants

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,640
actually use light and capture that

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,400
energy to drive the growth of plants so

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,339
if you'll indulge me I will have just a

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,159
few slides on some very basic plant

53
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,800
physiology and after that we will

54
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,400
actually move into more applied things

55
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,879
and ultimately bigger pictures of how we

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,580
can actually help the industry

57
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:31,318
safe electricity cost through better

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,800
light management

59
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,899
and so here we have a diagram of a

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,780
membrane that we see here going along

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,800
this slide that is present inside of the

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,259
chloroplasts inside the cells of leaves

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,599
and the basic mechanism that I'm going

64
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,239
to show you here basically occurs for

65
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,280
all plants and this is ultimately light

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,560
energy is captured it's going to get

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,500
converted into chemical energy which

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,080
then can be used to make sugars and

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,300
plant biomass so the whole process

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,219
starts with a photon which in this

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,800
example is going to come from the Sun

72
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:11,039
that photon is captured and the energy

73
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,620
from that photon is used to drive the

74
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,179
movement of an electron through that

75
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,340
membrane with the help of a second

76
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,040
Photon right here this electron

77
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,098
ultimately moves through a compound

78
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,919
called nadph that is an energy rich

79
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:29,339
molecule that subsequently can be used

80
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,939
and the Kelvin cycle where it is used to

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,239
convert CO2 into sugar at the same time

82
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:39,479
as this electron moves it also provides

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,799
energy to create ATP another energy rich

84
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,598
compound that is used to make sugars

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,379
interestingly and a bit of a side note

86
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,318
this photon is also used to split oxygen

87
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:55,500
from a water molecule and all of the

88
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,479
oxygen that we breathe ultimately comes

89
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,400
from this reaction right here so these

90
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,859
light reactions are photosynthesis that

91
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,120
we see here are very important not only

92
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,000
for plant growth but also for us being

93
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,519
able to breathe so this is the very

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,580
basic process that happens and it turns

95
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,639
out that the red limiting step of the

96
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,879
light reactions happens right here the

97
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,280
photo system 2 donates an electron to

98
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,219
what is called the plastic Canon pool

99
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,159
and if we can understand the efficiency

100
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,120
of that of this process then we can

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,800
actually calculate the whole

102
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,560
rate at which these light reactions

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,500
occur in plants and it turns out that

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,680
this is actually surprisingly easy to

105
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,600
measure if we measure fluorescence that

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,079
is given off by chlorophyll right here

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
we can very easily calculate the

108
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,639
fraction of absorbed photons that are

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,860
actually used to drive this electron

110
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,360
transport and that is called the quantum

111
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,520
yield of photosystem 2. and so a former

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,939
graduate student in my lab Jeff Weaver

113
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,180
collected data on lettuce throughout an

114
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,759
entire growing cycle in the greenhouse

115
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,800
and in this graph right here he plotted

116
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,040
the photosynthetic Photon flux density

117
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,460
on the x-axis against the quantum yield

118
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,620
of photosystem 2 and what we see

119
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,079
and this is true for all species not

120
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,319
just lettuce and let us the

121
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:31,079
photosynthetic Photon flux increases the

122
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,899
quantum yield of photosystem 2 decreases

123
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:36,839
in other words the more light we provide

124
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,060
to a plant the less efficiently the

125
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,239
plants can use that light to actually

126
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,360
drive plant growth

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,460
now if we know the efficiency with which

128
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,800
plants are using the light that they get

129
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,899
and we know the amount of light that

130
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,538
they receive we can calculate another

131
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:56,879
really important parameter the rate of

132
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:59,519
electron transport through the light

133
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,620
reactions of photosynthesis and that is

134
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,839
shown right here again we have the

135
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,360
photosynthetic Photon flux density on

136
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,459
the x-axis the electron transport rate

137
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,020
on the y-axis

138
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:14,819
and we see that electron transport

139
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:18,418
increases asymptotically

140
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:22,319
with increasing light levels and it

141
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:24,719
reaches a maximum here at some point

142
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,759
and so this is all the basic plant

143
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,639
physiology that I want to talk about but

144
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,819
the reason that we study this very

145
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,978
intensely in my lab is because when we

146
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,199
have an understanding of how these basic

147
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,360
processes and plants work we can

148
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,478
actually start to make predictions about

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,038
how to best manage

150
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:47,519
lighting and so

151
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,918
and from these curves we actually were

152
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,038
able to come up with a few hypotheses

153
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:57,180
first of all you should get the best

154
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:59,879
light use efficiency for plants if on a

155
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,600
short term you maintain the light level

156
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,060
as stable as possible that will result

157
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,520
in more electron transport than

158
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,300
fluctuating light levels that have the

159
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:15,359
same average ppfd as a stable light

160
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,000
level so short term we want to have a

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,080
constant ppfd throughout the entire day

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,899
as much as possible and more long longer

163
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,060
term we want to have the same amount of

164
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,159
light reaching the plants from day to

165
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,879
day so the total amount of light that

166
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,800
reaches plants within one day we we call

167
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,579
the Daily Light integral

168
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,139
and so theoretically at least

169
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:42,839
having the same Daily Light integral

170
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,240
from day to day we predicted would

171
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,239
result in better plant growth than

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,300
having fluctuating DLI levels that

173
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,180
average out to the same value but keep

174
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,240
in mind as I emphasize right here this

175
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:01,620
is Theory theories are great for science

176
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,900
that they need to be validated and so we

177
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,418
actually Then followed this work up with

178
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,939
studies where we tested both of these

179
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,698
hypotheses but see how important

180
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:14,699
actually is it in practice to have

181
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,460
stable short and long-term light levels

182
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,720
so the first study that I quickly want

183
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,478
to talk about

184
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,360
as a study that was done by a former

185
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,598
Master student in my lab rukaya bouyen

186
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,900
and she did a study in a walk-in growth

187
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,338
chamber basically a small vertical Farm

188
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:34,319
where she looked at short-term

189
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,140
fluctuations in the photosynthetic

190
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,379
Photon flux density every 15 minutes the

191
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:42,360
light level would go up or down and in

192
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:45,899
all treatments those light levels will

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,000
actually average to a ppfd of 200

194
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,179
micromoles per square meter per second

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,519
and so here you can see a picture of a

196
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,799
small part of the setup that she had and

197
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,679
then this red circle you can actually

198
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,259
see plants that were exposed to really

199
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,299
white fluctuations and ppfd so right now

200
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,399
these plants are in the dark but 15

201
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,620
minutes later these plants would have

202
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,839
been getting a photosynthetic Photon

203
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,659
flux density of 400 micromoles per

204
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:16,080
square meter per second

205
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,579
um so that it averages loud to 200 and

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,740
all these other plans were getting

207
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:24,480
different kinds of light fluctuations so

208
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,759
rukaya collected lots of data but right

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,339
here I just want to focus on plant

210
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,278
growth and let me go back real quick so

211
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,760
I want to First explain

212
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:39,480
the setup of this graph so on the bottom

213
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:42,419
x-axis right here we have the ppfd

214
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,700
during the 15-minute period that these

215
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:48,000
plants were exposed to low light levels

216
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,420
so it goes from zero to 200 micro moles

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,720
and at the top we have an auto axis axis

218
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:56,639
that shows default synthetic Photon

219
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,639
fluidland so they during the other

220
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,939
15-minute period And so that goes from

221
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:05,580
400 to 200 micromores so once again it

222
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,040
all averages out to 200 micromoles per

223
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,320
square meter per second rukaya worked

224
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:14,099
with two different lattice cultivars as

225
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,580
you can see right here little gem and

226
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,860
green salad bowl and she measured both

227
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,500
the dry weight of these plants as well

228
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,820
as the leaf area and so when we look at

229
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,240
the data

230
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,360
what we see is that as we go from left

231
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,100
to right

232
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,519
and the fluctuations and light level

233
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,879
become smaller and smaller it turns out

234
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:43,399
with very large fluctuations and light

235
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:46,379
level the plants grow very poorly but

236
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,139
in many of the treatments so when we

237
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:52,259
look at light levels low light levels of

238
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:55,078
80 to 200 micromoles or highlight levels

239
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,480
of 320 to 200

240
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:00,179
the plants grew the same and that was

241
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,039
true for the dry mass of the plants it

242
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:04,620
also was true for the leaf area of the

243
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:07,860
plant so what that study told us is

244
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,620
actually that we don't have to maintain

245
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,360
that stable ppfd for these plants to

246
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,639
grow well and use light efficiently

247
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,060
these plants are actually perfectly

248
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:23,039
capable of tolerating pretty wide

249
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:25,439
fluctuations in ppfd so the most extreme

250
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,199
treatment in which the plants do well

251
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,420
was the treatment in which the ppfd

252
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,160
fluctuated from 80 to 320 micro moles

253
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:37,319
throughout the entire growing cycle so

254
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,019
those are pretty big fluctuations that

255
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,680
the plants were able to adapt to that

256
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,959
very effectively so that's basically

257
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,359
told us that our hypothesis that we had

258
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,078
that stable ppfd levels are important

259
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,079
was wrong

260
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:59,220
um dcj alaf a PhD student in my lab that

261
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,439
a follow-up study but rather than

262
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,259
looking at short-term fluctuations and

263
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,500
light levels we actually changed the

264
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:11,338
ppfd from day to day

265
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,339
and this is a picture of part of the

266
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,820
setup that he used in the greenhouse as

267
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,680
you may see right here and each of these

268
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,920
different sections

269
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,778
we have a Quantum sensor that is

270
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,240
measuring the amount of light that is

271
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:30,539
reaching the plants that is connected to

272
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,639
a control system that allows us to very

273
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,799
precisely control the light that is

274
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,319
provided by these led bars that you see

275
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,219
right here

276
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,980
and we can then program in exactly what

277
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,079
the daily light integral is going to be

278
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,519
in all of these different sections and

279
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,599
we can have different lighting

280
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,959
treatments in each section so in the

281
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,360
study TC work with green salad bowl and

282
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,439
his treatments are summarized in this

283
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,560
table

284
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,320
and so we had one day with high DLI

285
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,599
which was always followed by a day with

286
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,740
low Daily Light integral and then again

287
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,019
we would go back to the High DLI day and

288
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,019
so there was one treatment in which the

289
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:19,139
plants received a DLI of 15 moles per

290
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,060
square meter per day every single day so

291
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,278
the dear life fluctuation which is

292
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:26,399
something that we'll see in subsequent

293
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:29,700
graphs was Zero the same Daily Light

294
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,620
integral each day and then as we go down

295
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,800
what we see

296
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,078
as increasing fluctuations and the Daily

297
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,000
Light integral with the modal extreme

298
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,278
treatment that we could realize in the

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,100
greenhouse was a high Daily Light

300
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,399
integral of 22 moles per square meter

301
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,740
per day followed by day a day with the

302
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,720
Daily Light integral of 8 moles per

303
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:56,459
square meter per day so the fluctuation

304
00:13:51,720 --> 00:14:00,060
then in this case is 14 moles per square

305
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:02,219
meter per day so here we have a picture

306
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:05,578
of what representative plants in these

307
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,160
different treatments look like so the

308
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:10,078
numbers here in Black show the DLI

309
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,299
fluctuation so the bigger that number

310
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,819
the more the light change from one day

311
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,399
to the next and what you can hopefully

312
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,040
see here already is that most of these

313
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:24,000
plants look pretty similar with the

314
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:26,159
exception of this plant right here that

315
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,860
had the most extreme fluctuations in

316
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,078
Daily Light integral that plant received

317
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,200
22 moles one day eight months the next

318
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,638
day back to 22 8 Etc throughout the

319
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,920
whole cropping cycle

320
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,299
but all of the other plants look very

321
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,059
very similar

322
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:44,219
so TC of course Quantified these

323
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,078
responses so here once again we have a

324
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,860
graph that shows the leaf area on the

325
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,979
left

326
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,759
and the dry weight of the plants on the

327
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,699
right

328
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,679
I mean that's statistics to compare all

329
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,439
of these different treatments to the

330
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,819
control treatment with a daily light

331
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,100
fluctuation of zero and what we saw was

332
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,459
that only the treatment with a DLI

333
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,220
fluctuation of 14 right here and

334
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:15,059
likewise in this graph right here those

335
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:18,000
plants actually grew more poorly than

336
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:21,359
plants that have the same Daily Light

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,198
integral each day so that's all that's

338
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,079
that the lettuce can actually also

339
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,599
tolerate pretty white fluctuations in

340
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,419
the Daily Light integral from day to day

341
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,699
there is a limit to how large those

342
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:37,740
fluctuations can get before you get a

343
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:40,859
meaningful reduction in growth

344
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,839
but we were very surprised to see that

345
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,240
these plants could actually tolerate

346
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,339
pretty substantial fluctuations in the

347
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,799
Daily Light integral without a

348
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,160
meaningful decrease in the growth of the

349
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:56,399
plants so once again the hypothesis that

350
00:15:53,159 --> 00:16:00,019
we started with was actually not correct

351
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,639
the plants turn out to be much more

352
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:05,639
tolerant of fluctuating light levels

353
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,079
both short-term and long term than we

354
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,100
had expected

355
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:13,620
and so that's really interesting to us

356
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,320
um and it is actually pretty important

357
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,879
because this opens up important

358
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,639
opportunities

359
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,980
related to how we control light and

360
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,620
control the environment agriculture we

361
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,959
don't have this precise control we don't

362
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,940
need to have this precise control where

363
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,039
we have the exact same light level

364
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,680
throughout the day or the same light

365
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,019
level from day to day we can take

366
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,239
advantage of the fact that these plants

367
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,220
are able to tolerate changing light

368
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,959
levels

369
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,579
and so one way that that ability of

370
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,578
plants to tolerate those light levels

371
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:52,859
comes into play is that it allows us to

372
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:56,299
take advantage of variable electricity

373
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:59,820
prices so many commercial facilities

374
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:03,359
don't have a SAT electricity price that

375
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,360
the price of electricity may depend on

376
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,818
the overall demand for electricity at

377
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,458
that particular time so we have an

378
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:13,918
example here of how the electricity

379
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,439
price for commercial facilities may

380
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,319
change over the course of a day

381
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,259
aware perhaps there is a preset schedule

382
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,899
as we see here for small and large

383
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,519
commercial customers where during the

384
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,480
middle of the day when there was a lot

385
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,480
of

386
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,480
activity the electricity prices may get

387
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,120
higher

388
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,400
or in some cases the electricity price

389
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,159
can change in real time as it's

390
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,160
indicated here by this example of this

391
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,480
red line so in that case the price of

392
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,558
electricity is responding continuously

393
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:55,440
to changing electricity prices so if

394
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,019
lots of people want electricity as you

395
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,200
see right here and right here the price

396
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:04,940
goes up and the hope to reduce overall

397
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,700
electricity use and so utility companies

398
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,980
do this variable pricing to try to

399
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,798
smooth out electricity use over the

400
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,558
course of a day it helps them manage the

401
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,500
grid if they can reduce the peak power

402
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,660
use so this is a really big deal for

403
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,819
utility companies but of course in

404
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,220
controlled environment agriculture this

405
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,980
is important because if we think about

406
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,819
variable electricity prices and the need

407
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:35,279
of for electricity to drive lighting

408
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:37,859
obviously we would preferably provide

409
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,178
supplemental lighting as much as

410
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:42,298
possible

411
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:44,759
during times of the day that the cost of

412
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:46,918
electricity is low and we would want to

413
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,379
limit the amount of light that we

414
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,640
provide or electricity that we use when

415
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,660
that electricity is expensive

416
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,480
and so

417
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,298
there is a complication with trying to

418
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,538
implement this in the United States we

419
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:06,359
have about 2200 large utility companies

420
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:08,720
there is another three thousand small

421
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:12,178
utility companies in the United States

422
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,519
and each utility company has its own

423
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,679
pricing structure that may be based on

424
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,619
real-time pricing they may have a preset

425
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,960
schedule and on top of that

426
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:25,379
and they typically have a demand charge

427
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,319
that is based on the peak power use of a

428
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,500
customer during a 15-minute window

429
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,558
during a single billing cycle

430
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,599
so not only does its utility company

431
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,940
have its own pricing structure what

432
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,798
makes and

433
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,320
implementation of this in lighting

434
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,079
control complicated is the fact that

435
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,798
there is no uniform way in which these

436
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,899
utility companies provide information

437
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:54,720
about electricity prices to their

438
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,360
customers they all have different ways

439
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,339
to do so and that means that

440
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,159
you may need to provide separate

441
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,500
software for each utility company to

442
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,980
take advantage or to be able to read in

443
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,900
real-time electricity prices and then

444
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,660
take advantage of that and lighting

445
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,660
control system so at this point I think

446
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,240
the biggest hurdle in implementing this

447
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:22,140
in a commercial setting is the fact that

448
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,419
we do not yet have a uniform way to get

449
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,660
that information about electricity

450
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,740
prices so hopefully that will change in

451
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,720
the future

452
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,720
and the other thing that is of course

453
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,000
important for controlling supplemental

454
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,579
Lighting in greenhouses are the weather

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,798
conditions and when I say weather what I

456
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:43,859
really mean is the amount of sunshine

457
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,900
that is going to be available over the

458
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:48,899
next day because if we know in advance

459
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,298
how much sunlight we are going to get we

460
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,340
can take that into account as we develop

461
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:55,200
the best strategy to provide

462
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:58,558
supplemental light

463
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,500
so at the University of Georgia we have

464
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,500
done some work on sunlight forecasting

465
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,259
we've tried multiple approaches and they

466
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,440
work really well during most of the day

467
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:14,220
but none of them actually work well

468
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,400
Before Sunrise and they don't work well

469
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,960
Before Sunrise because we don't have any

470
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,880
real-time information yet about how much

471
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
Sunshine is available

472
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,539
um

473
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,120
and so that is really problematic

474
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:32,759
because many greenhouses like to start a

475
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,759
supplemental lighting very early in the

476
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,200
morning maybe three or four a.m when the

477
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,700
neighbors are asleep and they don't

478
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
really care if there is any light

479
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,538
pollution and so it makes it difficult

480
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,759
to provide an optimal lighting strategy

481
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:49,558
if we don't know how much light we're

482
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,480
going to get over the course of the day

483
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,700
so

484
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,919
the Practical solution I think from a

485
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,519
commercial perspective is going to be

486
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,960
that companies that want to provide

487
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,480
strategies for lighting control simply

488
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,000
can purchase solar forecasts so solar

489
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,120
solar forecasts are readily available

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,298
and have largely been developed for

491
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,939
solar energy generation so that utility

492
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:22,879
companies can predict how much

493
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,798
electricity can be generated through

494
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,000
photovoltaic panels and so this is just

495
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:32,279
an example of solar forecasting actually

496
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,400
the first two and a half days that we

497
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,158
see here are in the past so we have two

498
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,500
and a half days of real world measured

499
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,200
light levels which are shown in blue

500
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,419
here it's called Global horizontal

501
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,519
irradiance but it's just a fancy term

502
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,460
for sunlight

503
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,519
and then here we have a day and a half

504
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,860
of forecasted sunlight levels and so

505
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,279
that information is going to be really

506
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:02,038
valuable to develop better lighting

507
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:05,460
control algorithms

508
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:07,140
so that purchasing these forecasts I

509
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,019
think is going to be the practical way

510
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,559
to do this so at the University of

511
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:16,440
Georgia with the help of the theme of a

512
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:19,019
colleague at the University Javad

513
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,940
Mohammad felmi we have developed

514
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,779
algorithms that can take into account

515
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,460
the needs of the plant

516
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,720
um

517
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,940
that can take advantage of variable

518
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,400
electricity prices and in our case we

519
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,058
were using sunlight prediction methods

520
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,100
and the goal was to minimize the cost of

521
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:41,940
electricity

522
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:43,500
um the algorithm looks like this right

523
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,960
here I'm not going to go through the

524
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,679
math right here if you're interested in

525
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,679
it the citation is right here at the

526
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,179
bottom so we implemented that lighting

527
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,460
control algorithm

528
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,820
from the previous slide and research

529
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,679
greenhouses at the University of Georgia

530
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:03,779
and this is a picture of part of the

531
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,960
setup that we had so we have an apogee

532
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,519
Quantum sensor right here that measures

533
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,279
the amount of sunlight that is coming

534
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,359
into the greenhouse that Quantum sensor

535
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,980
is connected to a Raspberry Pi

536
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,259
microcomputer and that Raspberry Pi

537
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,298
microcomputer does the required

538
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,819
calculations and then generate the

539
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:25,740
signal

540
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:29,579
through these Electronics right here

541
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,679
that is sent to the power supply of the

542
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:35,279
LED fixture so we have the power supply

543
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,798
right here the light fixture right here

544
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,599
and

545
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:43,859
lattice plants underneath it

546
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:45,418
and so this Raspberry Pi was controlling

547
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,019
the lighting throughout the entire

548
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:50,520
production cycle

549
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,740
and we have three different lighting

550
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,779
scenarios that we wanted to compare one

551
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,419
of them is what we call the Baseline

552
00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:00,599
scenario and that Baseline assumes that

553
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:04,259
we know in advance exactly how much

554
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:07,079
sunlight we are going to have when

555
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:09,179
so that results in the perfect solution

556
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,798
but because it requires precise

557
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,620
knowledge over how much light we will

558
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,658
get when it is impossible to implement

559
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:19,259
so this was basically a theoretical

560
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:21,179
control for this study and then we had

561
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:22,980
our prediction based method that takes

562
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,500
into account the crop requirements

563
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,380
variable electricity pricing and

564
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,778
predicted sunlight levels this was

565
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,120
implemented and we compared that to what

566
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:37,679
we call a heuristic lighting control

567
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:40,079
method where we make sure that we always

568
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,019
have a minimum photosynthetic Photon

569
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,178
flux density for the crop by dimming the

570
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:47,158
lights and respond to sunlight it's a

571
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:50,400
simple approach very easy to implement

572
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,679
but it is certainly not optimal that

573
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,360
said this is probably still better than

574
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,559
what is used in many commercial

575
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:01,500
greenhouses so when we look at how these

576
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,200
three different methods perform in this

577
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,900
case during a very overcast day what we

578
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,179
see here is the Blue Line shows the

579
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,159
amount of supplemental light that would

580
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,380
be theoretically the best possible

581
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,120
strategy in response to changing

582
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,278
sunlight during the day and the sunlight

583
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,219
right here is shown with the black

584
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,500
dashed line the sunlight levels were

585
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,620
extremely low this day

586
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,519
so our prediction based method is shown

587
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:31,500
in red and we see that it follows the

588
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,658
blue line or the theoretical Optimum

589
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,740
pretty nicely with a little bit of

590
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:39,900
Divergence maybe right after sunrise and

591
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,960
a little bit of Divergence right after

592
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,600
Sunset but overall it is very very

593
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,579
similar and both of these methods

594
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,918
provide a lot of day a lot of light

595
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,720
early in the day

596
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,059
um because electricity is relatively

597
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,740
cheap in this example and we provide

598
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:58,319
less light later in the day when

599
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,079
electricity is more expensive

600
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,079
the heuristic method provides the same

601
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:07,019
amount of light early in the day as late

602
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,240
in the day because it is not capable of

603
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,859
taking advantage of changing electricity

604
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,460
prices

605
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:17,099
when we then look at a

606
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,200
partly sunny day we have once again here

607
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:21,538
in Black the sunlight level so you can

608
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,600
see that it is a much higher than in the

609
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:26,640
previous example and B it goes up and

610
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,099
down quite a bit during the day

611
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,778
with what we see here let's start with

612
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:32,719
the blue line again that shows the

613
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:35,339
theoretical Optimum

614
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,778
the lights should be off during most of

615
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:39,599
the day and then a little bit of

616
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:43,859
supplemental light is provided early in

617
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:46,259
the day and once again late in the day

618
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:48,959
and we see that our prediction based

619
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:52,379
method does fairly well but it provides

620
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,019
a little bit too little light during the

621
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,778
morning hours and it has to make up for

622
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,778
that later in the day the heuristic

623
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:03,778
method

624
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:06,000
provides quite a bit of excess life here

625
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:08,579
during the morning hours and it also

626
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,619
provides quite a bit of light during the

627
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,778
the later part of the day

628
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:15,538
So based on these data we could

629
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:19,440
calculate the electricity use and the

630
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:21,960
cost of electricity required to grow a

631
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,080
crop of lettuce and a greenhouse

632
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,079
and so the stable summarizes some of

633
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:31,199
that information and so the prices here

634
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,939
are expressed in dollars per hectare if

635
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,038
you want to convert that to dollars per

636
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,100
acre you simply divide all of the

637
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:41,400
numbers by 2.5

638
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:45,480
but so to grow this letter scrub and

639
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,000
Rental time it costs 160 000 in

640
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,700
electricity and that is the best case

641
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,339
scenario the Baseline

642
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,519
um to provide the supplemental light

643
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:58,079
required to grow that crop when we

644
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,778
compare that to how well our

645
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:03,960
prediction-based method does we see that

646
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:06,380
that increases the cost of providing

647
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,480
that light by Seventeen hundred dollars

648
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:13,080
uh per hectare that's a one percent

649
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,839
increase in the cost of electricity so

650
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,819
we got within one percent of the perfect

651
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,038
solution and I would consider that to be

652
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:22,200
really accurate and we were very pleased

653
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:25,140
with that and then when we look at the

654
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,880
pretty simplistic heuristic approach for

655
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,640
supplemental lighting

656
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,559
we saw that your respect approach

657
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,020
increased the cost by eighty eight

658
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,119
hundred dollars per hectare or five and

659
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,278
a half percent and I actually thought

660
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:39,959
that that was not too bad either that's

661
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:42,599
still pretty accurate

662
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,058
but when we then look at what happens

663
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,339
during late spring when there was a lot

664
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:49,859
more sunlight available we see that

665
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:52,619
Precision lighting control a becomes

666
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:54,479
more difficult and B becomes much more

667
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:56,000
important so when we look at the total

668
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,980
cost

669
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,200
before that Lighting in an ideal

670
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,899
scenario that could be ninety five

671
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,120
thousand dollars per hectare in Spring

672
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:08,398
we have to provide less supplemental

673
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,500
line in Spring than in Winter which is

674
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,658
why the lighting courses got almost in

675
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,460
half

676
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,960
um and then when we look at the

677
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,700
prediction-based method that we

678
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,240
developed

679
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,278
our cost was 7 300 per hectare higher

680
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,740
than the perfect scenarios that we have

681
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,319
in roughly eight percent higher

682
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,480
electricity cost but comparing that to

683
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,240
the heuristic method

684
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,179
it increased the lighting cost by sixty

685
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,240
thousand dollars per hectare compared to

686
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:41,220
the perfect solution and fifty two

687
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,640
thousand dollars higher than our

688
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,740
prediction based method so now we see

689
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,960
that our prediction based method starts

690
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,700
to do much much better than the

691
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,159
heuristic method and once again I want

692
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,340
to point out the heuristic method isn't

693
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,899
all that bad when compared to standard

694
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:00,599
lighting control approaches that are

695
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:03,658
used in greenhouses so the bottom line

696
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:06,178
here is that there is a lot of potential

697
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:08,760
to reduce electricity cost by

698
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:11,038
implementing smarter lighting controlled

699
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,919
Solutions

700
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,839
and so our production-based method I

701
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,520
thought worked very well if we can get

702
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,980
weather predictions

703
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,619
um we have a forecast and incorporate

704
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,019
those I'm sure we can do better and I

705
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:28,619
want to point out that we got similar

706
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:31,139
plant growth on the our prediction based

707
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:33,619
method as compared to the eurastic

708
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,659
lighting control method but average

709
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:39,119
overwined through late spring the

710
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:42,179
prediction based method can reduce the

711
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:45,000
electricity cost by about 35 percent so

712
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:48,000
that is pretty substantial

713
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,398
and in principle this is pretty easy to

714
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,200
implement we need a Raspberry Pi

715
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,139
microcomputer

716
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,298
a Quantum sensor and some pretty simple

717
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,600
Electronics so that we can interface

718
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:01,798
with the actual LED lights

719
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,959
so

720
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,639
we hope to do larger scale trials this

721
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,860
coming winter to make sure that this

722
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,960
cell works and Commercial greenhouses

723
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,479
where we would have to control much

724
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,419
larger areas of lighting

725
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,579
and where we want to go with this in the

726
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:20,059
future and this is what something that

727
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:22,319
I'm really passionate about is make sure

728
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:24,058
that this battle lighting control

729
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,579
strategies that we've been working on

730
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:28,079
that they can meet the needs of the

731
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:30,259
controlled environment agricultural

732
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,538
industry and of course the main

733
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:36,058
objective for them is to make sure that

734
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:37,980
they can produce whatever crop they're

735
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:42,418
growing in the most profitable way

736
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:44,759
possible but we also want to take into

737
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,580
account the need of utility companies

738
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:50,220
and that means shifting as much

739
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:53,939
electricity use as possible from Big

740
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,700
hours away to times of the day that

741
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,519
electricity used by Society at large is

742
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,940
relatively low and that can reduce Peak

743
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,519
power use it can help utility companies

744
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,500
and manage the grid batter and this is

745
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,839
an issue that utility companies are very

746
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,179
interested in and ultimately what we

747
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,859
also need to do is meet the needs of

748
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,000
society

749
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,278
um

750
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,919
control environment agriculture can use

751
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,200
a lot of electricity generating that

752
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,200
electricity tends to generate greenhouse

753
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,960
gases and so what can we do to reduce

754
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,538
the amount of greenhouse gases that are

755
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,640
actually associated with providing all

756
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:35,819
of this lighting and control environment

757
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,679
agriculture hopefully we can cut that

758
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:40,639
significantly

759
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,200
but the question is that different

760
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,720
stakeholders have different priorities

761
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,340
so the question then and becomes how do

762
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,440
we balance these different priorities

763
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:53,339
and how do we make sure that everybody

764
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,820
ultimately comes out ahead and so this

765
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:59,278
is where my company candidates comes in

766
00:33:56,819 --> 00:34:02,879
because as a company we are much better

767
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:06,179
positioned to drive this Innovation and

768
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,220
make sure that it becomes available to

769
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:10,918
the controlled environment agriculture

770
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,539
industry so that we can Implement these

771
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,418
solutions that we develop at the

772
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:18,480
University at scale

773
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:20,819
and so what is really exciting to me is

774
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,740
that candidates is collaborating with

775
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,019
the national resources conservation

776
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:28,500
service through a conservation

777
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:30,719
Innovation Grant where we are

778
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,539
demonstrating the Energy savings

779
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,598
potential of advised lighting Control

780
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:40,259
Systems so to give you a very quick idea

781
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,480
of what we do with candidates here we

782
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,300
have a picture of our lighting control

783
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,579
system so we have a computer here with

784
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,619
some additional electronic components

785
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:50,639
that help us interface with the lighting

786
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,280
system

787
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,460
we use apogee Quantum sensors to measure

788
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,740
light levels and so this is the hardware

789
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,480
but with that Hardware of course we need

790
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:04,219
software which includes the user

791
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,139
interface so this is a screenshot of

792
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:10,259
what our users see and where they can

793
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:14,400
set how the lines should behave so they

794
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,500
can set the photo period right here for

795
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,660
um on the mantle or cannabis Growers

796
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,480
that can control the further period so

797
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:24,118
they can make sure attack control the

798
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,159
flowering of plants whether they want

799
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,960
them to flower or stay vegetative they

800
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,358
can do that through night Interruption

801
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,460
turning lights on for a few hours in the

802
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,679
middle of the night or through daylight

803
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,579
expansion and we have some unique

804
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:41,639
capabilities where we can use existing

805
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:46,079
dimmable Lighting systems to provide the

806
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:49,500
sliding at a relatively low intensity

807
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,680
we also have Daily Light carryover

808
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,539
where we can take advantage of days that

809
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:57,539
have a high Daily Light and to grow one

810
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,279
day we take that excess light and then

811
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:02,219
we can provide a little bit less light

812
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,140
the next day this is the user interface

813
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,659
where people see how the lighting system

814
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:08,879
is performing this is real-time data on

815
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:11,399
light in the greenhouse and the green

816
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,858
line shows how the LEDs are responding

817
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,960
to that you can have a summary of the

818
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:17,578
settings at the bottom and this shows

819
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,199
how much light the greenhouse has

820
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:22,260
received

821
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,358
and the next step of what we will do

822
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,420
with the nocs is actually develop

823
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,460
guidelines to develop incentive programs

824
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,858
or rebate programs for controlled

825
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,960
environment agriculture producers to

826
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:36,480
help them Implement these Advanced

827
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,940
lighting control systems in their own

828
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,159
facilities and

829
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,960
it's really exciting to us that there

830
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,480
are multiple utility companies that

831
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,579
already have started providing rebates

832
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,500
for better lighting control systems for

833
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,440
a long time they have provided rebates

834
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:56,099
for more efficient lights switching from

835
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,260
HPS to LED but what we see now is that

836
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,980
they also start to provide rebates for

837
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,380
better control systems and so ultimately

838
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,940
what this should lead to

839
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,680
does that controlled environment

840
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,079
agricultural facilities we have a

841
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:13,139
vertical farm right here a fully

842
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,440
integrated into the utility Network and

843
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:18,960
serve kind of as a buffer where we can

844
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,059
use less electricity when everybody else

845
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,220
needs more and then we use more

846
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,759
electricity when everybody else need

847
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:29,159
less and so with this

848
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,420
approached we can manage well we can

849
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,519
create a scenario where everyone

850
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,920
benefits and the only reason that this

851
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,800
is possible is that we have

852
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,039
an academic institution funding from the

853
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,619
USDA and a commercial company that

854
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,019
together once again with the USDA is

855
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:49,320
focused on implementing this at scale in

856
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:52,079
the industry so to summarize this we

857
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,539
want to optimize optimize production and

858
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,619
profitability for the industry

859
00:37:54,539 --> 00:38:00,838
help utilities manage their grid and we

860
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:03,000
want to provide benefits to society by

861
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,880
reducing greenhouse gas emissions so

862
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,820
ultimately there should result in a when

863
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,099
when scenario where everybody comes out

864
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,300
ahead and with that I would like to

865
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:18,059
acknowledge the USDA for funding project

866
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,599
lamp which does the basic research to

867
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:20,599
make that happen
