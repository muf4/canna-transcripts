Network a big Network a really big

Network we know you have citizens

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,960
agencies farmers and scientists that

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,719
depend on you and your precipitation

Network for Reliable accurate data are

8
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:20,839
you looking to upgrade your

9
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,599
precipitation gauges to a gauge that can

10
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,198
more accurately monitor solid

11
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:27,240
precipitation like snow and hail but

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
worry about the high prices of weighing

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,598
precipitation gauges are you looking for

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,719
a more cap a more accurate more robust

15
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,759
but also cost effective former

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600
precipitation measurement then we have

17
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,799
something for you introducing the apogee

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
Cloud burst the cloud burst is a

19
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,959
weighing precipitation gauge designed to

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,359
measure all forms of precipitation

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,160
including Rain snow hail and grapple the

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,799
cloud burst features are rugged

23
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,398
all-weather housing with a black ionized

24
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,558
Inlet that naturally sheds snow and

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,079
resists capping the inlet comes in two

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,320
sizes both with optional heating

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,400
elements there are no moving parts to

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,000
get overwhelmed clogged or seized the

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,840
cloud burst provides you with both

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,959
filtered and raw data assembled and

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,680
shipped from the US the cloud burst has

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,039
been designed to be cost-effective in

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,159
both implementation and maintenance the

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,280
cloud burst maintenance is quick simple

35
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,400
and toolfree with a large capacity

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,359
system maintenance intervals are reduced

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,118
meaning less hassle and less labor in

38
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,118
the field after 8 years of development

39
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:31,400
with several beta testers the Cloud

40
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,799
burst has been designed to meet your

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,200
needs and has proven to meet the highest
