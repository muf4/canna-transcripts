1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,099
At Apogee we sell a lot of PAR meters

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,533
and finding the right one

3
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:07,066
can feel a little bit overwhelming.

4
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:09,565
Stick around

5
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:11,932
and we'll help you find the perfect PAR meter

6
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:13,000
for your needs.

7
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,432
A quick refresher for those who might not know,

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
quantum meters measure light.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,065
To make it simple,

10
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,899
imagine that the light coming from the sun is like rain

11
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,265
falling from the clouds.

12
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,799
Our meters are like uncovering a sheet of paper

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,865
out in the rain for 1 second

14
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,700
and then counting the number of drops.

15
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:38,099
Counting drops is essentially what a quantum meter does

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,133
but instead of rain they count photons of light.

17
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,900
A PAR meter measures the amount of light

18
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,732
but only in the light spectrum

19
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:47,565
that promotes photosynthesis.

20
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:48,865
The light in this range

21
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:51,799
is called photosynthetically active radiation

22
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,965
this PAR wavelength spectrum

23
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:57,100
is between 400 and 700 nanometers.

24
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,865
Knowing this PAR information

25
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,899
can be vital in growing and studying plants.

26
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,732
It's similar to how we use calories

27
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:05,733
when studying the growth of humans.

28
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,400
Using other measurements like Lux or foot candles

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,966
fall short because

30
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:12,532
Lux and foot candles determine the amount of light

31
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,266
that the human eye can see

32
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,899
and the human eye

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,300
see some color of lights better than others.

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,299
The human eye is more sensitive to colors like green

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,965
than we are to red this is because our eyes use a rod

36
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,865
and cone vision system.

37
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:31,365
Unlike humans plants see all the colors  in that spectrum evenly.

38
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:32,700
So if you graph the

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,400
photosynthetic response of plants to light

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,100
it would look something like this.

41
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,832
So if we want to measure light

42
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:44,399
according to a plant sensitivity

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,365
a perfect meter would produce a response curve

44
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:50,233
that would look identical to that PAR curve.

45
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:51,766
With that understanding,

46
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,066
you have the knowledge that you need

47
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,766
to understand the variation

48
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,300
in the sensors that we offer.

49
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,500
At Apogee we produce three versions of quantum

50
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
or specifically PAR sensors.

51
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,100
The first is the Original X

52
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,566
then the Full Spectrum and last the ePAR sensor.

53
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,665
The Original X is the least expensive sensor we make

54
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,566
and it features a response curve that looks like this.

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,866
As you can see this response curve is not ideal

56
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,965
in that it overestimates the blues and the greens

57
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,566
while underestimating the reds.

58
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:27,566
It also captures a significant amount of UV light.

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,900
At first glance

60
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,000
it might not seem like a close match to this

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,566
PAR spectrum but with the over

62
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:36,000
and the under estimations being accounted for

63
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:38,465
it's not bad in terms of accuracy.

64
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:42,900
At Apogee Instruments we take pride in being a low cost

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,466
high science provider of measurement tools.

66
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,599
The high science PARt refers to the fact that

67
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,400
although the

68
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,366
inexpensive sensors might not be the most accurate,

69
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,600
we know exactly where and why they're not accurate

70
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:58,332
and with those shortcomings

71
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:01,099
we can use calculations to correct the data

72
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,000
and make that sensor sufficiently accurate

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,665
for a much lower price point.

74
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:09,800
Because the sensor tends to overestimate the blues

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,366
and the greens while underestimating the reds

76
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,666
it does not work so well for LEDs.

77
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:18,500
But we do have two broad spectrum calibration options.

78
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,699
One of those options is for sunlight

79
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,400
and the other is for electric lights,

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
like a T5 or a high pressure sodium.

81
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,600
This is a great lower cost option

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,900
if you're specifically measuring either sunlight

83
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,266
or these electric lights.

84
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:33,733
Our next sensor is the Full Spectrum sensor

85
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:37,099
and this is the response curve of the Full Spectrum sensor

86
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:37,932
as you can see

87
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:40,066
the response curve on the Full Spectrum

88
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,566
much more closely follows the PAR curve.

89
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,466
It also catches a little bit of UV

90
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,699
and kind of under response

91
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,699
a little bit on the blue but overall it's really good.

92
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,465
A sensor that can obtain a perfect PAR response

93
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,165
is impossible to achieve.

94
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,865
And you can spend significantly more amount of effort

95
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:56,700
and time

96
00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:00,700
which equals money chasing marginal accuracy returns.

97
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,566
This sensor is an excellent balance

98
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:05,033
between accuracy and cost.

99
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,932
Another benefit of this level response curve

100
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,465
is that the sensor is accurate

101
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,400
under all lighting conditions.

102
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:13,532
From sunlight to LEDs

103
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:15,832
to high pressure sodiums or T5s.

104
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,165
However,

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,065
the accuracy of this sensor does come at a higher price

106
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,365
than the original X.

107
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,800
All right one more type of sensor.

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
In recent years

109
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,300
there has been increasing evidence that far red light

110
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,300
found in the 700 to 750 range of the light spectrum

111
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,033
can contribute to plant growth

112
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,565
especially in plant leaf size and general

113
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:36,799
plant morphology.

114
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,300
This extended range has been given the term ePAR

115
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,766
or extended PAR and we have a Full Spectrum sensor

116
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,866
that includes this additional portion of the spectrum.

117
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,000
This is what the response curve looks like.

118
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:51,766
Alright, now

119
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:52,200
we've gone over

120
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,199
the quantum sensors that we have available

121
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,300
let me show you what formats we have these sensors in.

122
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,065
We have the handheld.

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,966
We have the DLI.

124
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,566
And then we have sensor only options.

125
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,565
Let's look at the handheld meters first.

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,065
The handheld meters are perfect for spot checking

127
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,000
and automatic logging of data.

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,565
It's a complete solution

129
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,599
that requires no additional hardware

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,300
or other components to operate.

131
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,566
The handheld meter allows for a sensor

132
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:24,799
that can be submerged, not the meter but the head can

133
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,765
and we have several underwater models

134
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,566
that have correction factors applied

135
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,099
for taking measurements underwater.

136
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,466
Like in an aquarium.

137
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,699
With all handheld quantum meters

138
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,500
you have the ability to access the DLI data

139
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,065
using the optional AC100 communication cable.

140
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,799
Using the Apogee Connect software

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,699
you can access all the saved data

142
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,099
in addition to the DLI measurements.

143
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,765
The next meter format we have is the DLI meter.

144
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,300
If a handheld meter is like

145
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,966
counting drops on a piece of paper,

146
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,833
DLI is like a bucket.

147
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:57,565
Rather than measuring light as specific moment

148
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,899
the DLI is collecting data

149
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,299
through the course of the day.

150
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,800
In math an intergal is a term

151
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,165
referring to the area under a curve.

152
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,199
So the Daily Light Intergal

153
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,765
is the amount of light during a 24 hour period

154
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:13,065
and is expressed in a term called moles

155
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:14,899
per meter squared per day.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,865
In addition to the DLI reading

157
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:19,466
the DLI meter gives you instant PAR readings

158
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,466
and the previous days photo period.

159
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,733
Photo period is the amount of time the light was on

160
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,466
in the last 24 hours.

161
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,799
When the DLI is connected to computer,

162
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,133
with the included USB C cable,

163
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:31,865
you can access the data set

164
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:35,332
with 99 days of DLI and photoperiod data

165
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,266
as well as the last seven days of PAR data

166
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,699
with averages over 30 minute intervals.

167
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,400
In summary the DLI meter is perfect for collecting

168
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,765
DLI measurements,

169
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,966
photo period measurements, and doing spot checks of PAR.

170
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,266
It's perfect for outdoor use.

171
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,800
The sensor is resistant to falling rain

172
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
but you don't wanna submerge it.

173
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,700
The last sensor format

174
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,065
we have is the sensor only option.

175
00:06:59,065 --> 00:06:59,899
This is ideal

176
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,500
for situations where you already have a system

177
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,800
or a method of collecting data.

178
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,865
We have a lot of options to match

179
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,065
whatever protocol your system uses.

180
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:11,965
So on our sensors we have various outputs.

181
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,000
We have analog and we have digital.

182
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,599
In our analog options

183
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,766
we have a 0 to 40 milah volt option,

184
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,600
which is our unappplified option

185
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
and it's capable of connecting with an Apogee Microcache.

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,533
The Apogee Microcache

187
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,699
enables app connectivity with Bluetooth connections

188
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,265
from your phone using the app that's available.

189
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:30,932
From the app

190
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:33,766
you can view data and adjust logging intervals.

191
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,400
We also have a 0 to 2.5 volt,

192
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,232
A 0 to 5 volts,

193
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,599
and a 4 to 20 million amp option available as well.

194
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,266
In our digital outputs we have an SDI 12 output,

195
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,600
a Modbus output, and a USB connection output.

196
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,966
The USB option

197
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:53,000
allows you to connect the sensor to a desktop computer

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,100
using the Apogee Connect app.

199
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,932
You can view and collect the data

200
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:59,000
and adjust your logging Parameters.

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,665
The sensor then can be disconnected from the computer

202
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:04,000
and then powered by a USB charger

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,199
where it can then collect data on its own.

204
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,665
If you're looking for the least expensive option

205
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:10,165
this is your best choice,

206
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,200
but it does require a computer

207
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,565
and takes a bit more time

208
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:15,232
and it's not quite as convenient.

209
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:17,465
With the various sensor output options

210
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,466
we have several cable lengths including no cable,

211
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,566
30 centimeter, and 2 meter.

212
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:25,232
We can even do custom lengths upon request.

213
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:28,132
In addition to our standard range of sensors

214
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,265
we have several specialized sensors,

215
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,100
like the light pollution sensor

216
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,800
which has a higher sensitivity

217
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,665
to a wider spectrum range

218
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,300
but will overrange around 200 micro moles

219
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,399
per meter squared. We also have an array sensor

220
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,632
that will take an average reading of multiple sensors.

221
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,365
Along with the various types of sensors

222
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,932
we have lots of mounts leveling plates

223
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:52,665
and other accessories for all of our sensors.

224
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,700
Hopefully now

225
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,932
you should have a better understanding

226
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,100
of what types of PAR

227
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,365
sensors we offer.

228
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,799
If you still feel a little lost or have more questions

229
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,932

and help you find the best sensor for your project.

233
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,100
Do you wanna learn more about ePAR

234
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,700
and how the additional range of light effect plant growth?

235
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,200
Consider watching this video by

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,966
