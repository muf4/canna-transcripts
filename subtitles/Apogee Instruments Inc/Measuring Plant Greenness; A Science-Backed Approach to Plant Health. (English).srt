1
00:00:01,165 --> 00:00:03,040
Take a good look at this color.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,041
Memorize it you're gonna need it in a minute.

3
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,416
Have you ever looked at your plants and wondered,

4
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:10,833
"how are you feeling?"

5
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,500
Unfortunately plants don't talk.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,416
If they do it means it's probably time to take a break.

7
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,082
[Taunting] "Yeah come on over here"

8
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,332
"yeah come on over here"

9
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,207
But if plants could talk,

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,332
understanding their problems would make it so much easier for us

11
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:28,750
to take corrective action

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,082
to make them happy. Luckily,

13
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:35,165
they do talk. Just in the language that we don't speak very well.

14
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,540
Generally speaking, the greener your plants the healthier they are.

15
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,332
That lush green color comes from chlorophyll,

16
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:50,332
the "magic" pigment that's responsible for photosynthesis.

17
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,207
It's chlorophyll allows a plant to turn sunlight

18
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:57,790
CO2 and water into glucose, creating food for the plant.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,082
Now greenness might not be the only factor in a plant's health

20
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:03,040
but it's definitely one of the key indicators.

21
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:05,457
So the more chlorophyll the greener the plant.

22
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:06,540
In some cases

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,207
it's easy to tell the difference between a healthy plant

24
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,290
and unhealthy plant.

25
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:12,665
But that difference is much harder to determine

26
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,415
when the colors are similar.

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,125
All right let's look at these three colors.

28
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,957
It's pretty easy to see that they're all green,

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,415
but they're not the same green.

30
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,582
The human eye is

31
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,207
really good at noticing the differences between colors.

32
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,707
The problem is we don't remember colors very good.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,665
Remember that color I showed you earlier? Which color is the same.

34
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:37,875
It's this one right here. So how did you do?

35
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,290
Maybe you got it right.

36
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:42,290
Now imagine taking a new color every day

37
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,040
and comparing it to samples from last month.

38
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,000
Imagine what that would be like.

39
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:47,915
Sure

40
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:51,625
you can tell which leaf looks greener as you compare and contrast

41
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:53,625
but how do you make consistent

42
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,000
data driven decisions over time about your plants health.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,707
What we really need is a scientific way to quantify that chlorophyll

44
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:04,125
and as a result understand our plants health better.

45
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,375
I'm gonna let Bruce show you what has been

46
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,500
and still is the gold standard for measuring chlorophyll.

47
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,415
In order to get the gold standard

48
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,040
you have to take that disc out from the exact same spot

49
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,500
on the leaf that the measurement was made.

50
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:24,790
We take this is done with a Cork borer.

51
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:30,000
We put it into a little vial of dimethyl sulfoxide.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There's different extraction solvents

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,375
but this is the one of choice.

54
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,500
And mix it up. So you look in here,

55
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,750
you can see this tiny little leaf disc

56
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,540
floating in this extraction solvent.

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,540
The chlorophyll doesn't come out right away

58
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:53,000
and to speed it up we put it at 65 degrees Celsius.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,500
So here's walking over to a drying oven.

60
00:02:55,875 --> 00:03:00,125
Putting it in the drying oven with that extraction solvent

61
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,250
and now we wait and it typically takes about three hours

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,832
until all the chlorophyll is gone from the leaf

63
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:13,332
in solution still 65 degrees

64
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,915
there's the file three hours later

65
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:20,750
and now the disc is white and all the chlorophyll's in solution.

66
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:24,332
So with step 1 is extract the chlorophyll.

67
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:26,790
This is one measurement on one leaf.

68
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:33,625
Now the next step is to bring it into the laboratory and measure it,

69
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,915
transfer it into a cuvette, measure it in our spectrophotometer.

70
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:41,832
Which scans the appropriate wavelengths

71
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,625
and then reads them out on a computer.

72
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:49,082
Will zoom in here for you in just a minute on these values,

73
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,832
which show the absorbance of those

74
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:59,665
of those two wavelinks with those two numbers in the correct equation

75
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:03,625
now that matches the instrument and the dimethyl sulfoxide.

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,957
We can calculate both chlorophyll a and B.

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,082
And we add the two values together and we have chlorophyll

78
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,790
so as long as your laboratory procedures are correct.

79
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,540
This is how you get the gold standard of chlorophyll.

80
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,082
But it's obviously a lot of work.

81
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,165
It's time consuming and expensive

82
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,707
but most importantly it's destructive.

83
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:30,665
You're not learning how much chlorophyll is in your plants

84
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:33,625
you're learning how much chlorophyll was in your plants...

85
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,291
that you just destroyed.

86
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,665
Luckily we don't have to destroy our plants to understand their health.

87
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,083
There are various non

88
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,166
destructive methods that measure the greenness of a plant

89
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,457
and the revolutionizing how we monitor our plants help.

90
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,040
There are two main non destructive methods for measuring chlorophyll

91
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:50,791
plants health,

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,832
color reflectance and color transmission.

93
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,708
Well although they both work in a similar manner

94
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,791
they are used in very different applications.

95
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,166
Both options

96
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,000
don't exactly tell you how much chlorophyll is in the plant

97
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,208
but they both give you a relative measurement of the plants health.

98
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,333
And when that data is taken over time

99
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,958
it begins to tell a story about the health of the plant.

100
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:11,791
Consider this data,

101
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,790
it was taken from the grass behind the Apogee Instruments building.

102
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,958
We have the time axis. We have the NDVI axis.

103
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,041
You can see that in the spring

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,665
the grass comes out of dormancy

105
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,333
and there's even a few late season snow storms.

106
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,250
Then you can see the happy healthy grass.

107
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,875
But over time you can start to see that grass become stressed.

108
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,082
Probably from water or from heat

109
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,958
and starts to lose that ideal greenness.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,833
Then as the months cool down

111
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,208
you can see the grass return back to its normal happy

112
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,041
healthy state.

113
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,958
These measurements are much like taking your body temperature

114
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,333
it won't tell you exactly what's wrong

115
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,416
but it will tell you that something is wrong.

116
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:51,500
And knowing there's a problem is the first step.

117
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,166
So how do we get this kind of data?

118
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,333
Well when light comes in contact with the leaf

119
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,541
it's going do a combination of three things.

120
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,875
It's either gonna be absorbed.

121
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,416
It's going to be reflected.

122
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,666
Or, the photons are going to bounce around and transmit through the leaf.

123
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,082
There are two primary

124
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,250
non destructive methods for detecting the health of a plant.

125
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,625
There's light transmission and light reflection.

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,083
The first method of measuring plant greenness is called

127
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,458
color reflectance. This is how NDVI meters work.

128
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,416
These devices work much like your eyes.

129
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:20,040
They compare

130
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,875
how much of the greenness is being reflected by the plant.

131
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,583
The NDVI sensor measures this greenness

132
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,500
by monitoring two specific wavelengths of light.

133
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,583
A sensor on top is measuring the incoming light.

134
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,125
And a sensor on the bottom measures the reflected light.

135
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:37,250
Since red is the opposite of green

136
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,458
a green healthy vegetation is going to absorb most of that red light.

137
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,083
Near infrared is gonna be the complete opposite.

138
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,708
Healthy plants will reflect a lot of that near infrared light.

139
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,707
The NDVI calculation looks something like this.

140
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:51,750
Essentially,

141
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,625
the output is a value in the range of negative 1 to positive 1.

142
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,208
Where the higher values are going to indicate dense

143
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,333
healthy vegetation

144
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:02,375
and lower or negative numbers are going to suggest sparse vegetation,

145
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,625
bear soil or just not green.

146
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,833
NDVI is widely used in agriculture

147
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,250
forestry and environmental monitoring.

148
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:13,875
This method is great for non contact measurements.

149
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,665
It won't destroy your leaves.

150
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,082
In fact, you don't even need to touch your leaves.

151
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,290
Makes it ideal for aerial platforms

152
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,165
or remote monitoring of a crop canopy or surface.

153
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,582
It's easy, but it's just not as accurate as the next method.

154
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,415
Alright this is option number two.

155
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,875
This is light transmission.

156
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,875
Essentially what happens is the meter is going to clamp over the meatiest

157
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,040
part of the leaf.

158
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:40,582
It shines two wavelengths of near infrared and red. (similar to NDVI)

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,375
But this one uses a 931 nanometer and a 653 nanometer wavelength.

160
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,458
First you're going to calibrate and take a test with no leaf in between

161
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,625
to calibrate the meter.

162
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,416
Then you're actually going to take your measurement.

163
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,416
A light is going to be shined through the leaf

164
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,958
to the sensor on the other side.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,625
And its going to measure

166
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,875
how much of those two wavelengths is passed through the leaf.

167
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,416
Much like NDVI the red is mostly absorbed by the green

168
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,665
and then the

169
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,875
near infrared light is going to be mostly transmitted through the leaf

170
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,875
and only gonna be obstructed by things like cell walls

171
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,165
and leaf structure.

172
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,582
Now most light transmission tools will then give you

173
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,541
a relative light transmission number

174
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,832
like CCI or SPAD this number is much like an NDVI output.

175
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,000
It doesn't give you the amount of chlorophyll

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,375
just a relative number of light transmission.

177
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:27,540
You can start to see trends of plant health overtime

178
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,250
and gain that relative information.

179
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,165
It's more precise

180
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:33,000
because you're taking measurements on individual leaves

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,082
and not over the entire crop canopy.

182
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,415
The Apogee Chlorophyll Concentration meter

183
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,208
takes that relative light transmission number or that CCI

184
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:42,250
and then takes it a step further.

185
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:44,082
The Apogee MC-100

186
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,915
takes that CCI number and references it to a chlorophyll index

187
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,000
reference chart

188
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:53,582
and gives you an actual amount of chlorophyll in multimeter squared.

189
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,375
This meter is able to do this

190
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,125
because of the painstaking efforts of researchers

191
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,082
who took hundreds of measurements

192
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,375
using that gold standard method that Bruce described earlier

193
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,041
over multiple species to develop an index of references

194
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,375
for each of the species that are included on this meter.

195
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,125
Making it easier to get accurate

196
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,957
non destructive chlorophyll concentration measurements.

197
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,957
These two measurement tools make it possible to assess your plants

198
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,040
help accurately

199
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:22,166
repeatedly and most importantly without harming your plants.

200
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,791
So can plants talk still ... no.

201
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,416
But with the right tools they can tell you a story about their health.

202
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,916

Remember better data

205
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,291
better plants. We'll see you next time.
