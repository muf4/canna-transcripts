1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm Bruce Bugbee professor of crop

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:10,820
physiology at Utah State University and

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,219
we have been asked so often by home

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:17,640
growers what are the optimal conditions

5
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:21,179
to grow cannabis at home so in this

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,859
video I'm going to go through all of the

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,219
environmental all of the key

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,380
environmental parameters and the ways

9
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,140
that we measure them here in a research

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:35,700
laboratory and ways that you can measure

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,689
them at home to get optimal conditions

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,899
for cannabis we have a license to study

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,089
medical hemp at the here at Utah State

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,450
University so we're gonna take those

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,010
principles and now scale them down for

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,820
home use so one of the things that we

17
00:00:53,009 --> 00:01:00,329
often talk about our the nine cardinal

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,960
parameters for plant growth and I drew a

19
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,500
little plant here to give you a sense of

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,420
this let me put the parameters on here

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,868
and then we'll talk about each of them

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,650
in turn let's start with temperature I'm

23
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:22,799
going to just put Tim over here then

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:26,580
we'll put humidity then we'll put wind

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:31,469
and inside we usually call that air

26
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:34,739
velocity co2 and we put brackets around

27
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,868
that to show co2 concentration how do we

28
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,810
measure it what are optimum levels and

29
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:42,450
now we go underground and to get this

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,769
just right we go to around so we have

31
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,060
temperature down here in the root zone

32
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:58,140
We certainly have water in the root zone

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:02:00,259
nutrients and then find the oxygen oops

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,259
Oh

35
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:09,419
so here's our parameters you can pretty

36
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,990
quickly see that's only eight parameters

37
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,989
I want to start with light light we put

38
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,570
up here l IG HT

39
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,870
it's enormous it's coming from all

40
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:25,259
directions it affects everything in here

41
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,289
when we turn up to light the water flux

42
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:32,189
or the plant goes up the optimum levels

43
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:35,609
of other things change so to optimize

44
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:41,120
growth we have to start by optimizing

45
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:45,510
light now this same diagram is over here

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,209
I've shown this many times in talks but

47
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:54,689
what I want to show you is a little bit

48
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:57,750
of data from our laboratory on a couple

49
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:02,579
of cultivars here we can zoom in on this

50
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:07,169
baby get it get it big a couple of

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:12,110
cultivars this is yield and this is a

52
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:14,579
input parameter called D Li daily light

53
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:18,239
integral and what I'm going to show you

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:21,540
right now is how to measure this because

55
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,719
the higher the number the higher the

56
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:28,019
yield this is a curved line but look if

57
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:34,349
these numbers are still going up as we

58
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:38,159
approach 60 now 60 is a sunny summer day

59
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:41,659
no clouds at all in the middle of summer

60
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,000
that's the brightest day of the year and

61
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:47,099
hip benefits from that you don't always

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,039
have to grow it here it'll grow fine

63
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,769
down around 30 but if you want to get

64
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,250
maximum yield we need to push it hard

65
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:58,379
with light and if we push it hard with

66
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,150
light we have to optimize everything

67
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:07,579
else so let's look at the calculations

68
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,489
for this when we measure light we take a

69
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:13,379
ordinary quantum sensor and measure it

70
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,220
and if you just have

71
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:23,240
a quantum sensor with a meter you're

72
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:26,639
going to get a unit of that one's done

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:33,269
you're going to get a unit of micro

74
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:37,949
moles of photons per meter squared of

75
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:42,569
area per second this is the standard

76
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:47,400
unit from quantum sensors and what the I

77
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:50,728
in integral means is a you have this up

78
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:56,459
over a whole day so if we take a quantum

79
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:58,800
sensor and we measure 1,000 now this is

80
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:05,969
bright bright light is of pushing the

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:10,439
plant hard just like to get to over here

82
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:15,690
we're going to get two moles per meter

83
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:19,319
squared per day and this is what's

84
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:21,360
called daily light integral and the way

85
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,259
we get there is just add up to seconds

86
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,069
there's 3,600 seconds per hour

87
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,750
and so we multiply those together and

88
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:34,139
you can see a thousand times three

89
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:39,360
thousand we get three point six times

90
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:44,129
ten to the sixth micro moles per meter

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,069
squared per second now 10 to the 6 micro

92
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:51,860
moles is one mole that micro is ten to

93
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:55,918
the minus six so this is three point six

94
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,879
sorry this is per hour right here read

95
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:05,759
the seconds canceled three point six

96
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:06,779
moles per meter squared per hour in the

97
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,740
world of cannabis

98
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:15,388
we need short days to get the plants to

99
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:18,449
flower and make good flower buds and to

100
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:21,710
do that I think most people know to be

101
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:25,020
safe we go with to have our photo period

102
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:31,029
so now we multiplied these two

103
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:36,098
twelve hours 12 times 3.6 is forty three

104
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:40,689
point two moles per meter squared per

105
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:46,029
day this is how you get the daily light

106
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:49,029
integral after you measure this now used

107
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:53,409
to be you had to do some math after you

108
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:56,348
did this to calculate this but because

109
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,430
this is so important companies have

110
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:03,879
developed instruments to add it up

111
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:06,069
continuously and here's one made by

112
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,949
Apogee instruments it's connected to

113
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,680
this device this is a quantum sensor -

114
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,439
and this adds up the measures the light

115
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,930
and adds it up and because it's

116
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:22,629
bluetooth shows it on your phone and

117
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:26,280
what this is showing is the daily light

118
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:30,550
integral each day and this was outside

119
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,408
recently so you can see we got up to 35

120
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:39,848
this is in the spring of year cloudy

121
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:43,870
days or five inside we'd have a constant

122
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:48,218
light it also does photo period now this

123
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:52,120
is really critical because we want 12

124
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:55,329
hours and at night we don't want any

125
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,408
light pollution a little bit of light

126
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:03,008
leaking in can cause cannabis to not

127
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:05,168
flower at all or flower poorly so this

128
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,319
instrument is it's like a silent

129
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:10,180
Sentinel it's watching all the time make

130
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,649
sure the light is correcting the day and

131
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:17,259
make sure it's off and dark at night so

132
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:18,758
this this shows a whole bunch of screens

133
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,699
I'm not going to go through them all but

134
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:29,020
it collects data and summarizes it for

135
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:31,389
you so this is in addition to this

136
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:36,009
instrument how hard can we push the

137
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:38,120
plants a thousand gave us 43 now that's

138
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:40,849
fine we can grow find cannabis

139
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,990
that but if we want to push it we're

140
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:51,250
gonna need to go up to 60 now look what

141
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:56,419
happens if we increase this to 1500

142
00:08:51,250 --> 00:09:00,769
micromoles everything increases by 1.5

143
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:05,689
we take this times 1.5 and that's that's

144
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:11,449
see that's going to be 43 plus 22 it's

145
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:15,620
gonna be 60 to about 60 to micromoles

146
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:18,940
per meter squared per second now we're

147
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,310
up to where we're pushing it hard and we

148
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:25,940
get very high yields but boy the other

149
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:27,979
inputs also have to be optimal that's

150
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,839
why the rest of these parameters are so

151
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:43,970
important so I'm going to put near

152
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:46,790
maximum now we've done studies in the

153
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,589
laboratory at two thousand and healed

154
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,269
keeps going up at two thousand but

155
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:54,890
that's getting really high it's hard to

156
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:57,620
keep everything water so here's the

157
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:59,809
light level you want to pinpoint this to

158
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,639
make sure it's there it's the light

159
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:02,989
levels a lot like the speedometer in the

160
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,208
car if you're going to take this car out

161
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,879
for a fast ride you sure as heck want an

162
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:10,189
accurate speedometer in it to know

163
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,110
exactly how fast you're going of course

164
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,470
you got a lot of other gauges too but it

165
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:18,589
starts with getting the light exactly

166
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,320
right it's possible to measure light

167
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:26,170
with the foot-candle meter or a Lux

168
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:29,150
meter but those can lead to big errors

169
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:32,719
you need to calibrate them against a

170
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:35,449
good quantum sensor there's a lot of

171
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:42,920
stories of people having troubles with

172
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:46,129
lux meters and can lead to a difficulty

173
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,319
in the crop let's go through the other

174
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:51,000
parameters here if we're going to push

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:58,110
this crop part with a lot of light

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:05,549
temperature the temperature curve is

177
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:09,539
about I'm going to put 26 to 29 Celsius

178
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:11,609
and now I have to convert this this is

179
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:16,459
going to mm-hmm let me change this a

180
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,460
little bit here make it round numbers

181
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:31,440
let's do 25 to 30 degrees C and in

182
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:36,720
Fahrenheit that's 77 to 86 F this is a

183
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,530
broad top broad range and in this range

184
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,290
you're going to have pretty optimal

185
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:45,419
conditions when you have a lot of light

186
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:48,089
you got to have some cooling or you're

187
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:52,259
going to go hotter than 86 and that's

188
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:54,720
that's definitely not good now let's

189
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:58,500
look at humidity in these conditions

190
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,870
the plants produce a lot of humidity and

191
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,159
the key for the humidity is blowing the

192
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,830
humidity out so if we were to draw I

193
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,959
could probably put this up here but

194
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,180
here's a light box here's our plant down

195
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,550
here I'm going to put the plant on this

196
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:19,589
and green growing it's a big plant this

197
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:22,829
plant putting an enormous amount of

198
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:27,330
water into the air when the lights I'm

199
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:31,310
going to put h2o here h2o so you want to

200
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:35,940
have some kind of event like this to

201
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:39,149
have the air come in and blow out most

202
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,580
of the time the humidity is too high and

203
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:45,449
that leads to powdery mildew leads to

204
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,930
diseases so the optimal humidity is

205
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:52,860
really well exactly

206
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:55,229
optimum might be 60% but that's a pretty

207
00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:00,750
broad optimal you can grow fine plants

208
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:02,899
from 40 to maybe 70% as long as you

209
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,669
don't get disease up at the high end

210
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:10,339
to this so that's humidity and we're

211
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:13,458
venting this tube loadout at the same

212
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:16,550
time we're venting this number one it's

213
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:18,768
cooling the plant by venting which is

214
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:21,740
important with all this light to have

215
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:25,249
lots of ventilation and one way to tell

216
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,409
the ventilation is put your plant in and

217
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:29,389
measure the temperature and keep enough

218
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:33,649
ventilation so you don't so you don't

219
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:36,709
get above 30 Celsius or 85 Fahrenheit

220
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,208
and humidity same thing get a humidity

221
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,768
meter put them by the vent

222
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:45,919
make sure you don't get too high

223
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:48,318
humidity wind is you can get anemometers

224
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,748
to measure wind but generally you just

225
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:53,659
want plenty of air flow if the leaves

226
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:56,209
are moving slightly that's a good air

227
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:58,129
flow that's around a meter a second wind

228
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:04,178
speed and that's what you want to

229
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:07,999
maintain for this co2 II we've known for

230
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:11,240
since photosynthesis was discovered that

231
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:14,209
co2 improves crop growth in the

232
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,720
laboratory we can enrich co2 and big

233
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:21,078
commercial operations we enrich co2 it's

234
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,470
complicated to enrich at home so we

235
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:29,058
rarely enrich at home but we're

236
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:31,970
breathing out a lot of co2 in the house

237
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:34,818
anyway and the pilot light in a water

238
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,389
heater gives out a lot of co2 I measure

239
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:40,789
co2 carbon dioxide of my house and some

240
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:44,149
years ago I found the house never went

241
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:46,188
down to ambient co2 and after a lot of

242
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,499
testing I finally found out it was my

243
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:52,458
pilot light in my water heater that was

244
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:55,339
enriching co2 in the entire house it's

245
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:58,219
beneficial to enrich with co2 but it's

246
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:05,389
certainly not necessary to grow a great

247
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:07,899
crop ambient co2 is now about 400 parts

248
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,899
per million

249
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:17,039
the challenge with co2 is to keep it

250
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:21,300
from going below 400 and again if the

251
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:25,199
ventilation is not adequate the co2 for

252
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:27,599
a plant is like oxygen for people so the

253
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,020
water vapors coming out that's putting

254
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,590
co2 us black and chemistry so we're

255
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,779
gonna put co2 carbon is black the co2 is

256
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,180
going in if you don't have enough

257
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:42,419
ventilation you deplete the co2 in the

258
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:44,549
plants basically suffocating so make

259
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,259
sure we get plenty of ventilation to

260
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:50,669
keep the humidity low that temperature

261
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:55,740
low and then the co2 will automatically

262
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:58,189
be close to 400 and that's adequate some

263
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,919
years ago I did a TED talk called

264
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,040
turning water into food and that TED

265
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,129
talk was about how much water plants

266
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,649
really need now TED talks are 15 minutes

267
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:12,750
long I had to take a lot of stuff out to

268
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,850
make it fit but I'm going to show you

269
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,980
something that got cut from that TED

270
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:24,110
talk this is back from high school or

271
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:27,810
beginning college chemistry these beads

272
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,690
represent the ratio of gases in our

273
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:32,969
atmosphere and if you know a little bit

274
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,860
about the atmosphere most of its

275
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:42,899
nitrogen so this one is 80% nitrogen

276
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:46,460
this is an inert gas at 79 80 % of our

277
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:52,049
atmosphere what's the next biggest gas

278
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:56,370
oxygen so 20% of the air is oxygen shown

279
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:58,909
here in red then we go let's take this

280
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,919
one out for a minute

281
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:06,199
these four beads and this one there's

282
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:09,328
10,000 beads here this is carbon dioxide

283
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:13,410
this is what the plants have to work

284
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:16,500
with to grow if these four beads go to

285
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,449
three beads the plant growth suffers you

286
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,150
want plenty of aeration going through

287
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:23,880
your your grow tent

288
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:28,019
make sure it's adequate this once water

289
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,510
vapor blue there's quite a bit more

290
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,579
water vapor than co2 but here's the key

291
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,470
point

292
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:35,939
humans need oxygen and we had a lot of

293
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,430
oxygen for us

294
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,630
plants need co2 and they hardly have an

295
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:46,250
E and that's the whole reason that good

296
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,780
supply of air is critical to that plant

297
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:53,099
it's almost like you can't have a fan

298
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:55,079
that's too big in here but yeah at some

299
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:56,969
point it's a waste of electricity I

300
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,029
would just measured temperature and

301
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:04,589
humidity and keep those down because

302
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:09,059
drawing a scale drawing here here's the

303
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:11,490
lights and in this box all day long

304
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:13,409
they're putting a lot of light in that's

305
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,240
driving the water driving the

306
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:20,910
temperature you want to blow those out

307
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:23,970
one key thing about light the plants

308
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:28,290
need to be dark at night now most people

309
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:30,769
line this with silver or mylar let the

310
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:34,559
light reflect in black on the outside

311
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:36,480
you want to make sure this is dark at

312
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,669
night if there's light pollution

313
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,759
somebody turns on a light and that leaks

314
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,740
in your plants could not they might not

315
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,099
flower properly or they might not have

316
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,890
good you for this reason another thing

317
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:53,490
Apogee developed it's this sensor here

318
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,710
was a light pollution detector and it's

319
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,539
really sensitive to low levels of light

320
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,900
it's the same as the other one only a

321
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:02,730
detects trace amounts of light

322
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,290
contamination that's to keep it good and

323
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:11,819
dark because here's 12 hours of light

324
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:13,769
that means 12 hours of dark now by the

325
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:17,189
way we're studying lines that might take

326
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:19,799
13 hours maybe 14 hours of light but for

327
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:25,049
now to be on the safe side to have hours

328
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:27,960
of light and dark to be to optimize

329
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:30,559
yield you want to decide you want to

330
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,990
make a good decision about when to go

331
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:39,599
from vegetative growth or what

332
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:46,549
called veg to reproductive growth and

333
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:49,169
typically this is 18 in up to 24 hours

334
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,269
24 hours doesn't hurt the plants it

335
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,330
might not be used quite as efficiently

336
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:57,000
but you want a long photo period till

337
00:19:54,329 --> 00:20:04,259
you get a big plant and then you go into

338
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:09,500
reproductive and after that point it's

339
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:14,039
about not 12 weeks it's about 8 weeks

340
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,710
till harvest so I brought a couple of

341
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,349
plants in here to show you these are

342
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,579
some that we're doing research on here's

343
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,308
it there's a young plant

344
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:25,919
this is gets this big and depends on

345
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:28,019
again on the light level but it could

346
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,840
get this big two weeks

347
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:33,629
after depending on what you start from

348
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:37,589
but after you start from cut a rooted

349
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:39,960
cutting if we gave this plant 12 hours

350
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:41,699
right now it would start to flower and

351
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,350
it would never get very big it would

352
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:49,529
have a fine yield they just never get

353
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:53,039
very big so what we do is keep it on 18

354
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:56,700
hour long days and boom now it gets big

355
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,009
and now if we give it short days at this

356
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,690
point we're going to have a lot of yield

357
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:07,859
on one single plant the point here is

358
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:10,200
gauge when to switch to short days to

359
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:13,769
short to have our days make sure your

360
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,440
plants big enough to fill the space if

361
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:20,009
you switch too early you'll reduce yield

362
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,289
if you switch too late the plant just

363
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:26,009
gets too enormous bigger than you can

364
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:28,889
handle most plants increase in size

365
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:34,740
about 30 percent have to switch through

366
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:36,390
this one maybe even double in size this

367
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,940
one might get this big when it's done

368
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,740
this one would be enormous when it when

369
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,840
it flowers sorry

370
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,839
that's floatable period

371
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,009
this one we talked about light intensity

372
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,769
there's lots of choices for lights to

373
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:57,190
get the intensity high you absolutely

374
00:21:53,769 --> 00:22:00,339
have to measure it to so you know what

375
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,100
you're dealing with we've already talked

376
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:06,548
about all the blue labels in the foliar

377
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:09,099
environment but if you do not have an

378
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:11,859
optimal root zone environment you're

379
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:15,279
gonna have yellow leaves discolored

380
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:18,058
leaves purple leaves and that's why I

381
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:23,470
want to focus a bit on the root zone

382
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:27,480
here temperature if the root zone about

383
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:33,150
the same as the top one it's it's really

384
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:36,669
26 to 30 degrees C for temperature

385
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,309
oxygen nutrients and water all have to

386
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:43,509
be optimal particularly if we're driving

387
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:47,769
the plant hard now let's go over here

388
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:51,220
and I'll show you the media that we use

389
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:54,940
in the research laboratory these are

390
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:58,029
some media components lots of people

391
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:00,659
sell media for cannabis and lots of

392
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:04,750
people claim they have a special media

393
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:09,190
we make our own from simple ingredients

394
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:12,548
and we have done whoo 30 years of study

395
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:15,759
on media components now this is the

396
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:18,038
media we use here in the research

397
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,200
laboratory and I'm going to put it up

398
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:23,408
here and then I'll talk about options

399
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:37,798
for that let's see we'll put that in

400
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:37,799
Brown it is 50% peat 50% vermiculite

401
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,550
so I think most people know what Pete

402
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,380
looks like not everybody knows what

403
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:49,940
vermiculite looks like there's some

404
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,040
other additives we'll get to those but

405
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,710
these are the primary ingredients here's

406
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,960
Pete same you could buy this at any

407
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,329
hardware store in North America it

408
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,650
almost always comes from Canada this is

409
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:04,789
a great media in the United Kingdom

410
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,059
they're really trying to crack down on

411
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:10,909
minimal use of peat and they've gone to

412
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:11,779
many other things but in North America

413
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,660
them

414
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:19,210
it grows typically start with pita in

415
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:22,340
the media some substitutes for peat are

416
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,860
ground-up wood this is a product called

417
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:29,119
Hydra fiber which is a shredded wood

418
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:33,049
product and this can be used as a

419
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:36,859
substitute from peat or as an additive

420
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:40,299
to Pete here's vermiculite here's the

421
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:44,058
container I could put this on a slope

422
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:47,089
this was and still is sometimes widely

423
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:49,759
used for building insulation but this is

424
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:53,509
mica that's mine and heated and puffed

425
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:57,589
up it's not widely used by commercial

426
00:24:53,509 --> 00:25:00,470
growers of ornamental plants because

427
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:02,720
it's expensive um they used to use it

428
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,620
years ago but as it became expensive

429
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:11,240
they switched to perlite which is also

430
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:14,599
widely available in stores and you can

431
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,299
also use perlite but peaked is a little

432
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,569
better and when you're pushing plants

433
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:26,529
for optimal yields we'd like to use peat

434
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:36,189
and perlite let me put vermiculite or

435
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:36,190
perlite or shredded wood

436
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:48,370
shredded wood and the brand name that's

437
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,370
widely available is called Hydra fiber

438
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:54,099
we've done a lot of research on that in

439
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:57,019
this lab and it's a good good product

440
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:58,789
but again peat is the base and we've got

441
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:03,889
a lot of additives to it

442
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:09,170
I should mention it's not a tray coconut

443
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:14,480
choir just it's a strange name to spells

444
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:16,370
cocoa nut see all I are some people

445
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,509
pronounce it car some people announce it

446
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:23,089
choir just shredded coconuts and this

447
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:25,308
used to have a lot of problems 20 years

448
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:27,169
ago we did a lot of research on this the

449
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:29,058
companies that make it have really done

450
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,300
a good job cleaning it up and the

451
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:36,678
quality is much higher than it was so

452
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:41,509
coconut choir is a fine additive for a

453
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:44,750
media as well but we use peat and

454
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:48,400
vermiculite because we want the absolute

455
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,450
premium media vermiculite has

456
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,420
exceptionally good water holding

457
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,789
capacity it has exceptionally good

458
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:59,650
cation exchange capacity that means

459
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:01,460
ability to hold nutrients it provides

460
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:09,920
this is huge

461
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:12,829
for cannabis s I L I see a silica all

462
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,580
those little trichomes in cannabis are

463
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:20,359
full of silica on the leaves and more

464
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:23,449
than other crops cannabis benefits from

465
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:26,899
silica if you use vermiculite you

466
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:31,009
automatically get lots of silicon these

467
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,630
other products don't have any silica so

468
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:35,150
if you is one of these other products

469
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:38,330
you should find an additive of silica

470
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,809
and add it to the media or just use

471
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:45,439
vermiculite there's several sources of

472
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:48,829
silica products to add now let's talk

473
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,860
about what we add to this media of here

474
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:56,349
in our research lab and again this

475
00:27:50,859 --> 00:28:03,789
results of lots of studies peak is comes

476
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:05,969
pretty acid the pH of peat is about it

477
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:07,269
depends on the peat but I'm going to put

478
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,480
3.8

479
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:13,089
that's pretty acid Pete another benefit

480
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,529
of vermiculite is it's alkaline and you

481
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:21,579
mix them together and this automatically

482
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:28,539
plus V erm vermiculite this goes to

483
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:31,048
about 4.5 it's it's still asset but it's

484
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:35,190
a lot better than straight peat

485
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:42,789
so to help get this in the optimal range

486
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:46,960
we add it's hard to see this lime this

487
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:48,819
is just a powder it's added east of the

488
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,660
Mississippi it's added two fields all

489
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:59,200
the time and in particular we had

490
00:28:52,660 --> 00:29:04,950
dolomitic lime which which gives us some

491
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:15,370
magnesium I'm running out of room let's

492
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:19,080
let's put this plus lime and I'm going

493
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:19,079
to put comma dolomitic

494
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:27,808
and dolomitic is a unique kind of lime

495
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:30,388
that has both calcium and magnesium we

496
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:37,519
add that they get a look at this to make

497
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:42,538
sure I got my notes right at 40 grams

498
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:47,579
per cubic foot now I know this is mixed

499
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:49,470
units metric and feet but grams is easy

500
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:51,839
to measure I brought in my household

501
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,269
scale if you don't know on one of these

502
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,329
by one by two or three they're cheap

503
00:29:54,269 --> 00:30:00,349
it's easy to measure the weight of your

504
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:02,908
fertilizer on this here's a little jar

505
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:06,689
one one that I brought from home of the

506
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:10,169
blue powder fertilizer you weigh

507
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:16,278
everything out Oh on this forty grams of

508
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:21,778
lime this brings the pH up to about 5.5

509
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:24,179
and that's near optimum and it adds

510
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:27,659
calcium and magnesium to the mix and

511
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:31,700
just mix it in into the media as you

512
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:36,539
make it there's one other thing we add

513
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:40,490
I'm running out of room I put it down

514
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:40,490
here gypsum

515
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:50,970
gypsum is a common agricultural product

516
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:52,548
and it is calcium sulfate caso4 if you

517
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,798
had chemistry

518
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:59,668
this adds additional calcium which is

519
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:03,388
good many places have inadequate calcium

520
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:05,639
in the tap water and it adds sulfur here

521
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:09,240
in Utah we have low sulfur in our water

522
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,949
so we put gypsum into the media and

523
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,159
again you can buy this in many places

524
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:17,308
and we use up talat eyes gypsum it looks

525
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,860
like this add that to the median it's

526
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:24,990
really slow release over a period of

527
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:32,548
many months and you don't need nearly as

528
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:34,259
much gypsum ten grams per cubic foot and

529
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:37,230
I think you can it doesn't these are not

530
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,370
precise you can be off 10% and it's just

531
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,190
fine

532
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:44,579
I think it can visualize a cubic foot if

533
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:47,909
we wanted to do this all metric a cubic

534
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:52,288
foot is twenty eight point three liters

535
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:57,750
per cubic foot and now you can convert

536
00:31:52,288 --> 00:32:01,048
to all all metric so people there's a

537
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:03,538
lot of options the one we like the best

538
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:07,378
for an absolute premium media is peat

539
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:11,480
vermiculite with 40 grams per cubic foot

540
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:15,178
of line and 10 grams per cubic foot of

541
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,429
gypsum now we're ready to go we got our

542
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:24,840
container let's put the container down

543
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:27,059
here something like this you can see

544
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:32,398
these containers over here that we use

545
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:37,428
to grow the plants there's our here's

546
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,428
our container with our media in it

547
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:47,160
we keep this pretty fluffy to get plenty

548
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:52,399
of oxygen to be sure you have enough

549
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:55,019
oxygen you can buy an oxygen sensor

550
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,769
Apogee instruments sells an oxygen

551
00:32:55,019 --> 00:33:01,740
sensor to put in here that helps you

552
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:05,430
make sure you got plenty of oxygen in

553
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:08,880
your growth medium this media is so

554
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:11,670
fluffy that it's hard to overwater it

555
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,860
the water will drain out you want to be

556
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:18,769
sure you have a tray under this because

557
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:23,000
we're gonna want to flush some of the

558
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:31,859
nutrient solution through this and now

559
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:34,619
let's put in red nutrients we're going

560
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:38,849
to put nutrients in here what do we use

561
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:41,729
for nutrients the many companies sell

562
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:45,000
special nutrients we have tested many

563
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,670
things over the years I teach a class in

564
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,220
principles of plant nutrition it uses

565
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,670
this big heavy textbook mineral

566
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,950
nutrition of higher plants so we've

567
00:33:52,670 --> 00:34:02,160
analyzed nutrients a lot and we've done

568
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:05,640
many tests here we have found we use the

569
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,579
same fertilizer that we use for all of

570
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:13,230
our other plants wheat plants corn

571
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:15,898
plants tomato plants we can recommend a

572
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:19,110
general fertilizer that works well for

573
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:24,839
this and fertilizers come with three

574
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:31,769
numbers N and P and K and the one we use

575
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:33,600
is 20 - 10 - 20 has less phosphorous

576
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:37,230
plants need less phosphorous than

577
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:42,269
nitrogen and potassium so this ratio

578
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:45,449
gives us ample nutrients provided we're

579
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:49,369
slightly over watering and what it

580
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:51,779
really means is about 10% of the water

581
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:55,139
comes out the bottom and

582
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,150
want to catch it and put it on your lawn

583
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,819
put it somewhere else it's still fine

584
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:02,190
fertilizer but when this fertilizer is

585
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,140
running through it helps to ensure that

586
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,659
there's plenty of nutrients it's

587
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:10,289
possible to do this with no leaching it

588
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:14,819
just gets trickier so how much of this

589
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:18,659
do we put in to the mix here's another

590
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:22,050
instrument that you you really benefit

591
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:25,079
from this is an electrical conductivity

592
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,650
meter so this particular one sold by

593
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,319
Hana

594
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:31,769
we used Hana instruments we use these a

595
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,220
lot the more salt in the water

596
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:38,929
the higher the electrical conductivity

597
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:43,949
you can tell if your nutrient solution

598
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:48,049
is optimal by measuring this and let me

599
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:53,489
do a little demo for you turn it on I

600
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:59,130
made two beakers let's put them right in

601
00:35:53,489 --> 00:36:01,729
the front in fact I want to put these on

602
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:05,720
a piece of white paper because we're

603
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,719
we're gonna make a little demo

604
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:18,759
see the difference in color this is tap

605
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:22,088
water and this is our nutrient solution

606
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:24,039
it has a blue dye in it so you can tell

607
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:28,719
when it's there it should be just

608
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:32,019
perceptible very light blue so we put

609
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,489
this in tap water it depends on what

610
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:38,278
part of the country what part of the

611
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:50,139
world you live in but tap water is about

612
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:55,449
0.4 tap water 0.4 and the units on this

613
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:57,759
are milli-siemens per meter now the

614
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:59,499
units are a little bit messy in this

615
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:03,818
because different meters have different

616
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:06,129
units but here's tap water now look what

617
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:10,088
happens with the fertilizer this is very

618
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:11,769
dilute fertilizer put this in here stir

619
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:18,880
the second I don't know if you can see

620
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:21,848
it on the screen 1.27 this is 0.4 this

621
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,150
is one point two seven and I'm going to

622
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:30,759
put about one point three nutrient

623
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:33,670
solution the reason this is important is

624
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:36,248
you can measure the electrical

625
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:40,599
conductivity of this water that you

626
00:37:36,248 --> 00:37:43,419
collect and if this water is between one

627
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,088
and one and a half you know your plants

628
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:49,269
are doing well they're doing great if

629
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:52,858
you don't water enough this gets too

630
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:55,868
high and they have too many nutrients if

631
00:37:52,858 --> 00:38:00,159
or if it's a big plant it could be too

632
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:03,999
low too so you want to you put one point

633
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:07,719
three in the top and water enough so

634
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:10,538
this is about about one point three

635
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,719
coming out the bottom then you measure

636
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:18,689
that with an electrical conductivity

637
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,688
meter this is

638
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:27,039
the the fertilizer ratio to get this I'm

639
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,690
running out of room I'm gonna I'm gonna

640
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,429
have to calculate it because I can't

641
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,030
remember the number off the top of my

642
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:36,369
head

643
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:44,610
this is 20% n and we're gonna want to

644
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:53,710
get about 120 ppm in this is the optimum

645
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:59,349
level of fertilizer so 120 ppm is 120

646
00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:01,389
milligrams of n per liter a part per

647
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:04,329
million is exactly the same as a

648
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:06,009
milligram per liter if you do this

649
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:08,110
you're going to end up with an honorary

650
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,610
degree in horticulture that's it and

651
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:26,740
learn to do this math the fertilizer is

652
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:30,640
only 20% so this is 0.2 grams of n per 1

653
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:34,899
gram I'm going to call this blue because

654
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:45,489
it's the blue fertilizer so one hundreds

655
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:49,329
of 20 over 0.2 is 600 milligrams per

656
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:56,739
liter you can see there that take this

657
00:39:49,329 --> 00:40:01,440
times five so I've know 600 milligrams

658
00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:06,989
per liter equals six

659
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,990
he'll bond 120 ppm

660
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:24,378
this is this is 0.6 grams per liter this

661
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:24,378
is grams of blue powder ooh

662
00:40:24,898 --> 00:40:31,409
fertilizer there's the optimum rate now

663
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:34,199
it doesn't have to be exact it's close

664
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:37,798
to this but when I did this study over

665
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:40,259
there with EC I put in 0.6 grams per

666
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:42,268
liter of blue powder you don't need to

667
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:45,208
know how to derive it just write down

668
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:48,628
that number but the instructions come

669
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:52,638
with that on the fertilizer let me show

670
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:55,798
you briefly the vast array of

671
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,469
fertilizers that commercial growers use

672
00:40:55,798 --> 00:41:00,088
this is my folder now I know everybody

673
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:02,249
looks this stuff up on the internet but

674
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:05,608
I grew up at a time before the Internet

675
00:41:02,248 --> 00:41:08,608
so I still use paper here's one of the

676
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:10,378
charts with all the fertilizers use

677
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,058
these are called Jack's fertilizers

678
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:16,818
there's Peters fertilizers these are all

679
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:19,469
specialty fertilizers for specialty

680
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:21,838
applications to my knowledge these guys

681
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:23,729
aren't marketing a special cannabis

682
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,889
fertilizer at the moment but if they did

683
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:28,739
they should be selling twenty ten twenty

684
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:33,200
because after a lot of analysis this is

685
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:34,519
what we've gone to here these these are

686
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,198
[Music]

687
00:41:34,518 --> 00:41:39,628
sold by many companies Peters

688
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,568
fertilizers a famous brand name Jack's

689
00:41:39,628 --> 00:41:45,449
is essentially the same thing there

690
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:48,748
they're available in stores you could

691
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:51,688
buy these in small packets we buy them

692
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:52,948
in twenty five pound bags a whole pallet

693
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:55,138
load up them because we're going through

694
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:59,659
a lot of them but this is the ratio of

695
00:41:55,139 --> 00:42:02,849
fertilizer applied at this concentration

696
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:04,619
to get and you're gonna buy an EC meter

697
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:10,259
to make sure you didn't make a math

698
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:13,709
error to get about 1.2 to 1.3 of your EC

699
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:15,329
and a very slight blue color after a

700
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:20,188
while you get so good you can tell the

701
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:23,639
EC from looking at the color if you

702
00:42:20,188 --> 00:42:25,739
don't want to fertilize daily it is

703
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,230
possible to put in a

704
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:31,319
release fertilizer here are some pellets

705
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,599
this is a product called nutria coat you

706
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:38,570
can put these in these come in various

707
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:41,519
release rates they're not as precise as

708
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,920
watering each day with fertilizer like

709
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,320
this but for some kinds of studies if

710
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,990
there's reasons you can't do a liquid

711
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,150
feed or a straight hydroponics you can

712
00:42:48,989 --> 00:43:01,979
put slower these fertilizer in the

713
00:42:51,150 --> 00:43:04,530
bucket water you got to learn to how

714
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,599
often you have to water if when the

715
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:10,589
plant gets big let's let's go back to

716
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,910
these plants it depends on the life the

717
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:16,049
higher the light the more you have to

718
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:17,789
water this plant at a thousand micro

719
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:20,789
moles per meter squared per second we

720
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:23,849
could probably water it once every three

721
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:26,070
days how often do you think we need to

722
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:28,920
water this plant if there's a thousand

723
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:31,500
micro moles twice a day that's a big

724
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,750
plant in a small pot that means you've

725
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,809
really benefit from heaven some kind of

726
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:39,210
automated system or a bigger container

727
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:41,369
and lots of people go to quite a large

728
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:44,550
container so they only have to water

729
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:46,890
once a day but it really depends on how

730
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:49,650
big the plant is and then you get to

731
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:51,269
develop the skill of lifting the pot

732
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,608
this pot feels heavy

733
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:55,650
that means it's full of water when it

734
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:57,690
runs out of water it'll feel light

735
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:00,450
that's a tremendous skill keep lifting

736
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:03,780
your pots and gauge how much water is in

737
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:06,239
them you can there's many products you

738
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:09,560
can poke in here to get water in my

739
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,579
experience yeah it all comes back to

740
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,699
calibrating yourself you can do much

741
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:19,279
better by lifting the pot so we've

742
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:23,819
covered all of these Cardinal parameters

743
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:27,089
for plants nutrients and media are big

744
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,550
and light is big you want to get these

745
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:31,259
correct you want to make sure you want

746
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,690
to do temperature and humidity in your

747
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,680
box if you have plenty of wind you're

748
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:39,470
going to be fine with ambient co2 i I

749
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,598
want to conclude on one thing

750
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:44,059
lots of cannabis gets yellow leave

751
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,230
purple leave discolored leaves burned

752
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:51,940
leaf edges in our research here most of

753
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:54,230
the time that's from too much fertilizer

754
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,809
people panic and they think they don't

755
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:59,320
have enough but it's often from too much

756
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:02,539
which is why that EC meter is so

757
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,570
important and why flushing it like this

758
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:09,079
keeps it from being either deficient or

759
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:12,890
toxic because you're flushing the pot a

760
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:15,049
little bit each time you water if you

761
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:17,858
get these parameters right your plants

762
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:21,349
look just like that to be healthy green

763
00:45:17,858 --> 00:45:23,739
they and and it highlight you can you

764
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:27,349
can push them hard and get high growth

765
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:32,809
thanks for listening we'll join you

766
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:34,640
again on another video two more things

767
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:36,108
we already got two questions from the

768
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,379
audience that I want to make really

769
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:41,539
clear in this number one water with

770
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:45,050
nutrient solution every time you water

771
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:47,900
no different tap water it's very dilute

772
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:50,060
it's made to be watered every single

773
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,829
time no matter if you water once every

774
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:53,869
three days three times a day always

775
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:58,009
water with nutrient solution that's

776
00:45:53,869 --> 00:46:00,950
thing one thing to color of light this

777
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:03,349
is a huge question and many people have

778
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:05,769
strong opinions about colors of light

779
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:08,410
we've done a lot of studies on this

780
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:17,989
here's what it comes down to for

781
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:22,429
homeowners white WH ite white light the

782
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:25,549
reason I recommend that is you can see

783
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:28,190
the plants you could diagnose subtle

784
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:32,000
differences in color of the plants you

785
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:34,460
can diagnose tiny insects in the plants

786
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,838
there it's aesthetically pleasing you

787
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,030
want to look at the plants there's this

788
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,699
old Chinese saying the best fertilizer

789
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,960
is the footsteps of the farmer well if

790
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:43,189
the plants are in white light you're

791
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,280
going to want to look at them and you're

792
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:49,280
gonna tell purple lights are slightly

793
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,680
more efficient but white lights have

794
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,550
come a long ways now they can be white

795
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,759
plus red

796
00:46:52,550 --> 00:47:01,420
that's good but something that makes the

797
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,420
plants look green that's the key Thanks

798
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:07,390
you
