1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,759
well my name is Ben Crabbe I do

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:04,679
technical sales and support here at

3
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,229
Apogee instruments I'm here today to

4
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:10,349
talk to you about a set of new

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,969
coefficients that we have for our MC 100

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,620
chlorophyll concentration meter we

7
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,239
should have two different sets two new

8
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,269
sets two new species that we can measure

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,100
accurately cannabis and grapes and so

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,079
I'll briefly go over how this meter

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,760
takes measurements of absolute

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,839
chlorophyll concentration and then we'll

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
go into how to get those new

14
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,059
coefficients select them and start

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,070
taking measurements so very briefly the

16
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,738
operation of this meter is based on the

17
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,630
transmittance of light at red and

18
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:42,000
near-infrared wavelengths through a

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,489
plant leaf this this item has a has two

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,009
LEDs in it one of which emits light in a

21
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,259
revelant red wavelength of 653

22
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,628
nanometers the other one emits light and

23
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,058
a near infrared wavelength of 931

24
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:56,939
nanometers now the red wavelength the

25
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,709
plant plants can use that that type of

26
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,358
light for photosynthesis and so most of

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,179
that light gets absorbed and used by

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,859
leaf light if the longer near-infrared

29
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,469
wavelengths can't be used by the plant

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,969
and so it will just pass through the

31
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,670
leaf and the leaf doesn't do much with

32
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,280
it or it gets reflected off and so we

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,990
can derive this CCI value this

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,390
chlorophyll concentration index or

35
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:20,429
chlorophyll content index as the ratio

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,049
of transmission values at the

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,049
near-infrared wavelengths and the red

38
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,590
wavelength and so in this example shown

39
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,810
we have a CCI value of about 7.5 and so

40
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,469
this is a nice relative indication but

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,118
it's unitless and one of the great

42
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,310
advantages of this meter is that it will

43
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,200
convert that unitless measure into a

44
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,320
measure of absolute chlorophyll and the

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,930
way we do that is we follow a

46
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,569
methodology a method outlined in this

47
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,520
academic paper insa tree measurement of

48
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,069
leaf chlorophyll concentration analysis

49
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,078
of the optical / absolute relationship

50
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,718
just published by christopher perry mark

51
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,309
blanco is Bruce Bugbee in 2014 and you

52
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,429
can read it at your leisure if you like

53
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:07,049
in the paper they they correlate that

54
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,689
CCI value to the quantity of chlorophyll

55
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,670
in the leaf which they derive using

56
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,509
elaborate

57
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:16,969
techniques they do this for 22 or 23

58
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:19,299
different species all of which have

59
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:21,680
coefficients loaded on to our meter

60
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,689
here's a brief look at the results of

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,750
their paper on the x-axis we have the

62
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:28,639
CCI values those unitless values on the

63
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,819
y-axis we have chlorophyll concentration

64
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,399
measurements in absolute values of micro

65
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,409
moles per meter squared and so you can

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,030
see that there's there's a positive

67
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,068
relationship but it's not perfectly

68
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,419
linear it's not a straight line there's

69
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:42,679
a little bit of a curve to it and

70
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:44,059
there's a little bit of difference

71
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,319
depending on the species that you're

72
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,879
using each of these different colored

73
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,810
lines correlates to a different type of

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,729
plant and then on the bottom panel we

75
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,259
have the curve for the general set of

76
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,639
coefficients so you could use if you're

77
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:59,780
using if you're studying a plant that is

78
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,189
not included in this list here's another

79
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,989
look at those type of curves this comes

80
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,879
out of our owner's manual and we just

81
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,250
show wheat rice and corn again they're

82
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,620
similar but not not precisely the same

83
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,800
so it's nice to have a curve

84
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,799
particularly to your species now this

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,000
video is inspired by our new cannabis

86
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,650
coefficients as well as grape

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,530
coefficients here's a look at the new

88
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,439
cannabis coefficients in green compared

89
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,069
to wheat and the general set of

90
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,699
coefficients and you can see that

91
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:31,310
cannabis is has a different shape to it

92
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:33,078
for the same cci value CCI values on the

93
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,569
x axis down here and absolute

94
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,610
chlorophyll on the y axis so for the

95
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:39,530
same CCI value it's about almost a two

96
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,100
times difference 1.8 times difference

97
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,680
between cannabis and wheat if you're

98
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,840
looking at the same chlorophyll value

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,799
it's on it's about two and a half times

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,509
difference in CCI and so this new set of

101
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,530
coefficients will be great for our

102
00:03:53,509 --> 00:04:00,019
cannabis customers so now that the part

103
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,640
where I'll go over very quickly how to

104
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,870
get those coefficients load them onto

105
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,689
your meter select them and take

106
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,120
measurements we will download the

107
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:10,699
coefficients from our website we will

108
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,950
connect this to our computer using a

109
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:15,229
little USB cord it came with we'll drag

110
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:18,620
the new files onto the folder that shows

111
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,598
up from this MC 100 well disconnect it

112
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,209
then we'll navigate to the coefficients

113
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:24,139
on the screen here and then you can

114
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:26,089
start taking measurements

115
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,870
and it's just pushing down this arm with

116
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,869
the leaf in between

117
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:42,538
