1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,730
I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,798
Instruments and I'd like to in this

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
next couple minutes introduce Apogee's

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,550
new four-component net radiometer to you.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,559
Now this, here it is, this is something

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:16,079
we've been thinking about for 20 years

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,059
my whole career I've been thinking

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,828
about ways to more accurately measure

9
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,890
and model net radiation and then four

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,658
years ago we started a project to build

11
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,509
and improve net radiometer. It's not been

12
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,749
a trivial task but we're excited to

13
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:33,479
introduce this to the world. So I'm going

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,299
to give you about a 30 second review of

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,628
how we got to this point. We started

16
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:41,698
seven or eight years ago

17
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:44,549
testing all of the net radiometers

18
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,128
available on the market at the time in

19
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:48,178
the field.

20
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,489
This is a picture of Mark Blonquist the

21
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:52,948
chief scientist at Apogee out precision

22
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:55,530
leveling these radiometers cleaning them

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,050
all to make sure we have good data to be

24
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,149
sure we had it right we bought

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,799
triplicates of each of five types of

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,380
instruments to evaluate their accuracy

27
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,030
in the field.

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,420
What we found from this was the two

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,090
types of net radiometers that could

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,368
separately measure the four components

31
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,569
of net radiation were by far the most

32
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,688
accurate and in this picture

33
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:27,449
they're shown here as the Kipp and Zonen

34
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,450
this is a CNR 1 this is now been

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,200
upgraded to the CNR 4 and the Hukseflux,

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,570
which is here, and if we look hard

37
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,758
and here you can see triplicates of all

38
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,129
these sensors on this mess. We ran this

39
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,429
all summer long, collected enormous body

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,640
of research and concluded if we're going

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,218
to do a good job at net radiation we need a

42
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:54,538
four-component instrument. Now this work was

43
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:58,590
published here and you can pause this

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,329
and get the paper you can get it on the

45
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,419
Apogee website, Accuracy of Net

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,099
Radiometers. So what is our instrument

47
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,379
look like?

48
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,469
Here's a picture of it and you might

49
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,479
think this is life-size because these

50
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,579
instruments have historically been big

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,430
and after a lot of work we were able to

52
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,010
reduce the size and weight of this

53
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,349
instrument so we're quite proud of being

54
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,090
able to do this because it makes it far

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,659
easier to mount and to use. Let's take a

56
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,460
look at what the four components really

57
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,879
mean. In this big picture this little

58
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,310
dome here is for short wave radiation,

59
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,670
which apogee is spent the whole 20 years

60
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,919
of the company precisely measuring

61
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,739
shortwave. So we start with the Sun,

62
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,719
always smiling,

63
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,289
this is short wave in, you also need to

64
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:55,889
measure shortwave reflected and that's what

65
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,809
this bottom is. These are the two

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,189
components of the four. Then we have long

67
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,789
wave radiation from the sky coming in

68
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,859
here, measured here, and long-wave

69
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,860
radiation from the soil here. That's a

70
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,890
four-component net radiometer, four

71
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,379
separate measurements coming out to the

72
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,909
instrument.

73
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,030
Let's take a look at the state-of-the-art

74
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,539
for net radiation, and this is

75
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,870
exemplified by two instruments.

76
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,189
The first one is the Kipp and Zonen CNR 4.

77
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,979
Now it has the same component

78
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,169
shortwave in and out, long wave in and

79
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:42,479
out and the Hukseflux NRO1

80
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,810
shortwave in and out, long wave in and

81
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,719
out. These instruments are bigger, heavier,

82
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,129
and more expensive than the newer Apogee

83
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,019
net radiometer. There's two other very

84
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,469
significant differences between the

85
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,599
Hukseflux and the Kipp and Zonen and

86
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,199
the Apogee, because net radiometers have

87
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,109
a lot of outputs they take up a lot of

88
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,920
channels on a data logger. Here's a

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,870
classic

90
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,769
CR 1000 data logger, made by Campbell

91
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:26,698
scientific, if we hook either one of

92
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,329
these instruments up to it we have  a bunch

93
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,969
of wires that look like this. Now

94
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,949
let's look at these wires and where they

95
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,199
go on this this diagram.

96
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,900
These are the analog channels. We have

97
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,899
shortwave radiation that comes into one.

98
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,579
We have shortwave radiation out, this is

99
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,918
incoming this is out, these are two more

100
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,029
channels. Long-wave in two channels,

101
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,049
long-wave out two more channels, now we're

102
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,150
out of channels on the top and we

103
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,469
haven't measured the reference

104
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,110
temperature yet. That is a platinum

105
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,750
resistance thermometer for the reference,

106
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,439
and to make accurate measurements of

107
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,939
that we need to differential channels so

108
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,490
we've consumed most of the analog

109
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,490
channels on this instrument and we still

110
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,519
haven't run

111
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,680
the heater for this to make accurate

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,139
measurements that need to be heated. So

113
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,900
now we have h for the heater and that's

114
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:33,929
two more down here, and 12 volts, and

115
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,579
ground. That's what it takes to connect

116
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,348
one of these instruments to the CR 1000.

117
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:47,399
Because of that extensive network of

118
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,859
wires and the complexity of users

119
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,300
getting all those hooked up right and

120
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,470
all the calibration factors Apogee went

121
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,000
to an SDI-12 output for this sensor in

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,579
which all of the A to D conversion is done

123
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,399
here in the center in the head

124
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,620
what does that look like? One wire with

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,259
three subcomponents. Let's take a look at

126
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,930
what where those go. Oops

127
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,280
I'm going the wrong way.

128
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,009
Here's a new version of this, the Apogee

129
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:29,019
takes up one comport, one

130
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:33,219
12 volt, and one ground, that's it.

131
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,919
All the calculations are done here and

132
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,740
it still has individual outputs for the

133
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,470
four components. That's a big advance. It

134
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,139
makes the wiring simpler and greatly

135
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,970
enhances the user interface. Now, doesn't

136
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,759
stop there because for precise

137
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,310
measurements you want heated sensors

138
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,310
Apogee has tiny heaters because it's

139
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,649
small the heaters only need to be tiny

140
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,560
to keep frost off of this to keep dew off

141
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,569
of this in the summer accurate

142
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,460
measurements night and day. How's that

143
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,989
look? You already got a little preview of

144
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,639
this when I showed this, but look at this.

145
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,348
There is the heated apogee sensor on one

146
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:17,079
of our typical winter days, clear as a bell,

147
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,719
excellent measurements.

148
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,090
Oh great, it's a heater doesn't that take

149
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,318
a lot of power?

150
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,319
Let's take a look at the power. The CNR 4,

151
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:33,879
which requires, here's the CNR 4

152
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,800
here is the heaters and the fans for the

153
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,590
CNR 4 this fits on like this,

154
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,709
how much power does this take, this

155
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:53,168
combined unit? 6 watts to keep the CNR 4

156
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:56,288
clear. How about the Hukseflux? This

157
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,329
doesn't have fans but it has heaters in

158
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:01,418
here to keep frost from forming. The Hukseflux,

159
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:05,348
which is the NR01 that

160
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:11,050
comes in at 1.5 watts (roughly drawn to

161
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,389
scale here). What's the Apogee take, this

162
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:20,829
small thing? 0.74 watts this can easily

163
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:23,800
be run from a solar panel in the dead

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,038
of winter these cannot, without

165
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,079
having an enormous battery and a

166
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,139
big solar panel. So that was another

167
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,620
breakthrough tiny heaters to keep this

168
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,129
free.

169
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:39,639
Here's another picture of it, frost all

170
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,828
over. This does not have to be heated

171
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:42,728
that's why this insulating

172
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,860
plastic is in here to heat

173
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,570
just the part that needs to be. So we

174
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,879
worked hard at minimizing that power

175
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:55,689
consumption of this. So the big advantages

176
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,779
are simpler to use, fewer wires to hook

177
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:01,659
up, less consumption of all the wires on

178
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,458
your data logger then you can use those other channels

179
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,849
to measure other things with this, much

180
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,079
lower power requirements and a small

181
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:13,778
footprint so it's easier to mount, and

182
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:15,610
then finally all of these are four

183
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,459
way net radiometers to get the best

184
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,719
accuracy possible. In our longer video we

185
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,660
talk about measurements and models of

186
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,750
net radiation many people try to model

187
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,759
net radiation from a single measurement

188
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,000
of shortwave, we show in that video and

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,129
in the manuscripts that we've published

190
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:39,490
on that, that the measurements are far

191
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,919
superior to the models. The

192
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,129
best models with the best inputs are

193
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,799
still plus or minus ten percent for the

194
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,539
accuracy and in the world of saving

195
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,599
water plus and minus ten percent is a big

196
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,310
deal. You don't want to overwater

197
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,049
10-percent you don't want to underwater

198
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,500
10-percent. So we've done all this work

199
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,139
to make make this small and

200
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,560
low-power, how's the accuracy compared to

201
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,659
the larger models let's take a look at

202
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:11,919
that? We ran this instrument for 15

203
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,879
months summer, winter, summer on a weather

204
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,100
station over alpha, you can tell this is

205
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,690
Utah because of all the mountains in

206
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,180
the background, here is the rolls-royce

207
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:28,568
instruments at CNR 4 mounted right

208
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:32,078
there on the panel and if you squint you

209
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,448
can see three Apogees on here,

210
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:37,750
they're small so they had some bird

211
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,509
spikes on here to keep this clean. How's

212
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,088
the data come out after 15 months of

213
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,680
work?

214
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,708
Here's the reference CNR 4, here's the

215
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,958
three replicate Apogees, we were

216
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,768
thrilled to see this tight line here.

217
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,169
If you look closely at this you can see

218
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,818
some scatter the CNR 4 was not heated

219
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:03,969
and ventilated so there was days with dew,

220
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,559
which caused that to read low so some of

221
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,448
these data in here are caused by

222
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:12,669
problems with the reference not by the

223
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:16,028
Apogees. These high radiation days where

224
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:18,159
there was no dew all three

225
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,688
replicate instruments lined up

226
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:21,399
beautifully.

227
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,139
That's what we've done to make this

228
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,519
accurate for the user is refine and

229
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,649
refine and refine not only is it good

230
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,558
out-of-the-box it's stable over many

231
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,308
years.

232
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:37,600
Thanks for listening we are excited to

233
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,999
get this in your hands for future

234
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,920
measurements help you make more accurate

235
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,328
measurements.

236
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,818
We've already had numerous instruments

237
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:48,938
out with with users in many places and

238
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:51,698
all the reports are terrific, and people

239
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,708
have been excited to know when became

240
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,698
available.

241
00:11:54,698 --> 00:12:03,118
We hope you can purchase one soon.
