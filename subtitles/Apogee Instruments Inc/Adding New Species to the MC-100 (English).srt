00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,060
Hello, my name is Ben Crabb; I do technical sales and support here at Apogee Instruments.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:09,589
Today I'm here to talk to you about the process to load new coefficients onto your MC 100

3
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,359
chlorophyll concentration meter.

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,308
What inspired this process is that we have some new coefficients for cannabis and for

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,309
grapevine.

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,019
But in the future, as we have new species with new coefficients, you can use this same

7
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:26,509
process to access those new files, add them on to your meter, and get the most accurate

8
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:28,248
measurements you can.

9
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:31,238
So the process will be: we go to our website.

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,939
We download the files from the MC-100 product support page.

11
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:42,320
We connect this MC-100 to the computer, and that will allow us to access the folder on

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,689
this device with the files.

13
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:48,780
You drag the new coefficient files that you just downloaded onto the MC-100.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,088
You disconnect it.

15
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:56,500
Then you navigate through the menu on the MC-100 to cannabis or grapevine or whatever

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,999
species you please.

17
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,170
And then you can start taking measurements.

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,060
So let's show you how to make all this happen.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,689
You can go to our website http://www.apogeeinstruments.com.

20
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:14,109
Click on the “support” tab up at the top.

21
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:16,978
And find the chlorophyll meter page.

22
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,569
We’re now on chlorophyll meter support.

23
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:21,739
Right here “new coefficients.”

24
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:25,670
You can click on this link, and this will take you down the page to the relevant spot.

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,430
Or you can just scroll down and get to it that way.

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,430
But here's the chlorophyll meter new coefficients.

27
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,649
We have a link here.

28
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:38,489
We also have instructions here that you can follow case my video doesn't suffice.

29
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,229
You can download the setting or the new coefficients right here.

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,640
Now let's open up a new Explorer window.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,640
We can go to our downloads.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,700
Here's the new coefficients it just download.

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,090
Extract them because it's a zip folder.

34
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,969
So we extract them.

35
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:59,798
Now we can see we have two files in here, they’re .tab files -- some kind of an encrypted

36
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:04,420
file format that works well on the MC-100 meter.

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,189
And all we're gonna do is we're going to connect this and drag these files over.

38
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:15,439
So I'll quickly just move over to the display of the meter so you can see the buttons I'm

39
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,359
pushing.

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,740
So here's our meter.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,810
We'll turn it on.

42
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,469
Hopefully… there it goes.

43
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:29,909
We plug it in with this little USB cable that it came with.

44
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,530
The other end of which is in the computer.

45
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,080
So now it's plugged in.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,520
You hit “data” and it says “USB link active.”

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,689
Okay so this means that it is connected to the computer, and you ought to be able to

48
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:45,270
access the relevant folder now.

49
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,140
So switching back over to the computer view.

50
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,799
We'll open up another Explorer window.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,100
And we can see we have an option “MC-100.”

52
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,530
So you open this up, and you see a bunch of other .tab files for all the other species

53
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,080
that have coefficients already loaded onto the meter.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,270
So all we're gonna do is we're going to take these two files, and we're gonna drag them

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,469
in.

56
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,370
Oh I already had them in there, but we'll replace them.

57
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,080
So now we have cannabis and we have grapevine in the meter.

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,580
When you do this they may show up down at the bottom so you have to scroll all the way

59
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,590
to the bottom of the list when we get to this step.

60
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,450
But for the time being they're in there.

61
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:34,539
And so now I'm going to switch back over to our MC-100 display…

62
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,449
Okay we'll just hit this “eject” button.

63
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,599
It says “unplug the USB cable.”

64
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,090
Okay so now we're back to the usual screen, but we expect we should have new coefficients

65
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,400
on here we could select if we want to.

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,030
So to get to them we hit “run.”

67
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,460
Then we hit “setup.”

68
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,920
Then we hit the down arrow a couple of times until we get to a screen that says “use

69
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,000
custom measurement.”

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,139
At this point we hit “edit,” and this highlights this “units.”

71
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,139
Says “yes.”

72
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,489
I think you can make it say no, but we want to say “yes.”

73
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,150
You can make it say “yes or no” by hitting up and down.

74
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,358
So now that we have “yes” highlighted, we hit the right arrow.

75
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,938
Now we've got 27 files with different coefficients for different species.

76
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:28,379
And we just scroll through until we find… let's look for cannabis… it may be down

77
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:35,150
at the bottom or maybe it's in the middle of the list somewhere…

78
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,848
There's cannabis down at the bottom.

79
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:41,329
So the last two here we have grape and we have cannabis.

80
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:42,459
Excellent.

81
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,979
Let's hit “accept.”

82
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,259
Now we have cannabis coefficients selected.

83
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,960
We can exit out of this screen.

84
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,329
And we're ready to take measurements.

85
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:57,818
You can just stick the leaf in there, depress the press the arm, and you'll be taking accurate

86
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,300
absolute chlorophyll concentration measurements of cannabis.

87
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,819
Or if you selected grapevine, you can get them for grapevine.

88
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,439
As we develop coefficients for new species, we'll put them at the same location on our

89
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,439
website.

90
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,620
That's support page for the MC-100.

91
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,680
And you can follow this same procedure to get them added onto your meter.

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Thank you very much!

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:16,959
Have a nice day.
