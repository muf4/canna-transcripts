1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
hello my name is Skyler Smith and I do

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,849
technical sales and support here at

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,318
after the instrument and today we're

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:10,169
going to talk about choosing the right

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,699
infrared radiometer for you going

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:13,589
through all the options of infrared

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,359
radiometer that African Instruments has

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,850
to offer

9
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:19,710
so we're going to cover all the field of

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,380
view options we're going to cover the

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,510
difference between the SI 100 si 400 and

12
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,038
si f-series and then we're going to go

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,630
through a demonstration of using our

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,970
field of view calculators that we have

15
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:34,769
available as an app and on the

16
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:39,238
spreadsheet so first thing the SI 100

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,489
and si F 100 series are both analog so

18
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,259
that means that they both require two

19
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,119
channels in order to read them a

20
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,189
differential channel to read the

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,619
millivolt output from the thermo-pile

22
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,030
and then a single-ended channel in order

23
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,609
to read the sensor body temperature

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,170
which is the thermistor and so those

25
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,570
thermistors are usually measured with

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,030
half bridge measurements and so the

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,869
difference between the SI 100 and sis

28
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,969
100 is that the SI f 100 is a fast

29
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,789
response at the point two second

30
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,368
response time whereas the SI 100 has a

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,020
point six second response and then you

32
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,540
can see how that affects the signal size

33
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,329
it being a much smaller signal between 5

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,420
and 15 micro volts per degree C on the

35
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:24,150
SI f series whereas the SI 100 is

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,530
between 20 and 60 micro volts per degree

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,799
C so the SI 100 is ideal for static

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,650
stations on traditional data loggers

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,170
your si F 100 series is ideal if you're

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,090
on a moving platform of some sort doing

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,340
measurements connected to data loggers

42
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,609
that have that high resolution that can

43
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,609
read that small signal the SI 400 series

44
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:50,519
is all completely digital using the SDI

45
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,828
12 protocol so that's ideal for your

46
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,769
static stations require multiple sensors

47
00:01:52,828 --> 00:02:00,929
with a logger that can read that digital

48
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:03,539
sdi-12 then in each one of those we have

49
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,600
the different field of view options for

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,670
the SI 100 s 5 400 series we have 4

51
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:13,079
field of view options from our narrowest

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,889
14 degree half angle field of view up to

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,200
our horizontal

54
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,339
field of view and then we report that in

55
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,019
half angles and if you want more

56
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,420
information you can click there on that

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,090
website unfortunately do the small

58
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,299
signal size we only have three of those

59
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,620
field of view options available so we've

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,600
put together this table to kind of

61
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,129
explain a little bit better but for the

62
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,209
largest field of view the 22 degree

63
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:41,009
field of view we have the SI 111 si 411

64
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:43,110
SI f 111 and mi 210 the mi referring to

65
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:45,209
the infrared radiometer connected to the

66
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,180
handheld meter that gives you that

67
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,680
temperature so you can look there to

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,569
find your corresponding field of view

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,459
for which model it corresponds with and

70
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:59,909
this is a great illustration showing

71
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,729
that same concept so the si 111 is equal

72
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,199
to the 22 degree field of view and you

73
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,599
can see in this particular application

74
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,539
where you're doing crop canopy the si

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,699
111 may not be ideal because it's seeing

76
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,049
much more than just a crop it's seeing

77
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,429
the trees and the mountains in the

78
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,650
behind it whereas the horizontal is

79
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,900
seeing the most amount of the crop and

80
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,269
just the crop without anything behind it

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,230
and we'll go through this next on the

82
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,489
field of view calculator demonstration

83
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:32,219
so the field of view calculator is

84
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,439
available as an app just search for

85
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,549
Apogee instruments in your app store and

86
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,729
you'll be able to find that and a few

87
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,860
other things we have to offer and then

88
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:42,840
it's also available on our website and

89
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,120
there's the link right there you can

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,629
click on that and we'll just go to the

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,289
website right now and go through that so

92
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:56,189
just come here to Apogee instruments

93
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:58,828
comm so here we're on the webpage on the

94
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:02,849
homepage we'll come over here to support

95
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:06,060
we will click there and then on the far

96
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:13,169
side over here is infrared radiometers

97
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:15,959
so we'll click here now there is a lot

98
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,339
of information on this page a lot of the

99
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,108
frequently asked questions so if you

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,149
have questions yourself if this is going

101
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,918
to fit for your application I would come

102
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,620
look through here and then a lot of

103
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,569
helpful articles and links on trying to

104
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,590
get that to work for you

105
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,230
first one there being filled of you

106
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:33,359
explained I mentioned that on an earlier

107
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,860
slide but that is the link that you want

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,720
to look through if you want to get more

109
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,520
information on that we're going to click

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,000
on the second one here fill the view and

111
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,719
canopy fraction calculators we just open

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,629
this up here and it's going to say

113
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,250
viewing angle and viewing height so

114
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,500
let's just take for an example let's say

115
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,480
we wanted to do a 10 meter by 10 meter

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,550
plot and we want to measure the crop

117
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,890
canopy inside this 10 meter by 10 meter

118
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,329
plot so we want to maximize our field of

119
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,000
view to get as much of that in there as

120
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:05,219
we can so let's start with the SN 111

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,620
which is equivalent to that 22 degree

122
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,550
field of view and let's just say that

123
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,600
our viewing angle is 65 and our viewing

124
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,180
height is 1.5 meters above the canopy so

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,470
if we calculate it gives over here and

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,709
says our field of view is seeing 122.8

127
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,030
meters squared well which is good

128
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,069
information it tells us the total

129
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:31,469
surface area at seeing but we don't

130
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,540
really know how that's allocated and so

131
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,640
to get those details we need to look at

132
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,439
the excel sheet and so that's right here

133
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,689
this link here excel sheet program to

134
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:44,100
calculate target area so download that

135
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:45,750
and then open it up so I've just I've

136
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,070
done that already so here's that excel

137
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,009
sheet what it looks like

138
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:52,560
and I've pre entered in these values so

139
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:56,599
I've chosen the SI 111 which is

140
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,269
equivalent to 22 degree field of view 65

141
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,360
degrees is our angle from the angle from

142
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:06,329
the surface and then 1.5 meters above

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,449
the crop and that gives us that same 120

144
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:13,289
2.82 if we scroll down then we'll see

145
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,969
those details so first off again we're

146
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,330
trying to look at a 10 meter by 10 meter

147
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,550
plot is our example so we want to know

148
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,899
how what eye length is from A to D what

149
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,000
our field of view is seeing so if we

150
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,120
come down here we see right here it says

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,250
27 point 2 so that's way too long we

152
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,110
need to cut that down to 10 so let's

153
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,850
come back up and let's adjust the

154
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,850
numbers and let's adjust this to 63 and

155
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:41,360
be one meter above the crop so we've

156
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,990
significantly lowered this

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:50,240
from 122 to 24.2 let's see how that

158
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:51,680
allocates so our a to D is right here

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
ten point five six so that's pretty

160
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,949
close so that's pretty close to our 10

161
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,960
meters and then our C to F or B would be

162
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,479
our widest part and we come down here

163
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,430
and it's one point four six so we need

164
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,150
to double that so we have the full width

165
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,740
and that would be three meters so

166
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:12,829
essentially we're at three meters wide

167
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,250
and just over ten meters long if we were

168
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:17,779
to use the SI 111 in that application

169
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,120
but let's look at what it would look

170
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,579
like with the horizontal so if we come

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,340
over here into the SI one h1 let's go

172
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:29,899
back to our original numbers of doing 65

173
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:32,000
and 1.5 that's 65 degrees with our

174
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,659
height being 1.5 meters above the crop

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,149
canopy and then if we come down here we

176
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,300
can get our details so we want to know

177
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:43,969
first what is our length that we're

178
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,180
looking at and so we need to know G 2 -

179
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,730
G 1 and that's equal to V right here and

180
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,350
it says it's five point one four so it's

181
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,720
less than our centimeter so that's good

182
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,120
we could possibly maximize s more but

183
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,330
that's that's less and then let's figure

184
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,149
out our widest part or G 2 to F times 2

185
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:04,849
is equivalent right here to eight point

186
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,069
zero five so that's not maximized either

187
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,540
that's less than our 10 meters so we can

188
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,060
come back up here and adjust them and

189
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,640
let's actually just adjust it to two

190
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,310
meters above the crop leaving the angle

191
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,849
the same so we've almost doubled our

192
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,800
surface area from 27 to 48 meter squared

193
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,010
and then we'll come down here and look

194
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,920
at V it is now six point eight five

195
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,289
meters along so we're closer we're still

196
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,009
within that ten meters but then our

197
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,899
width which is G 2 to F is here ten

198
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,580
point seven three so we're just over

199
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,189
that 10 meters but we're pretty close we

200
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,620
could obviously dial that in to maximize

201
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,960
it so you can see in this example of our

202
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,659
10 meter by 10 meter square plot the

203
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,690
horizontal does it does a lot better

204
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:53,659
covering more surface area and

205
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,860
maximizing that field of view now as you

206
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,139
can see in these examples

207
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,000
we're doing pretty specific angles so in

208
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,559
order to get those angles highly

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,659
recommend using some sort of angle

210
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:06,619
locator angle finder so you can get that

211
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:08,480
right on 62 degrees or 65 degrees we

212
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,820
resell these but you can of course buy

213
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,350
your own or find your own anywhere just

214
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,870
so you can get those angles exactly

215
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,940
where you want them so that concludes
