17
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:20,640
our legendary par sensor with an

18
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,618
aspirated temperature Shield

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,640
then we added a humidity

20
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:28,560
a CO2 and a pressure sensor

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,200
finally we gave them the monitoring

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,299
power of Bluetooth data logging using

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,700
the micro cache we took all that

24
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,500
technology and placed them within a

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,600
compact housing

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,180
the guardian stands watch over your

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,519
Greenhouse with real-time tracking of

28
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,079
nine metrics

29
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,298
this data can be retrieved through

30
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,099
Bluetooth using your Android and iOS

31
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,439
devices

32
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,298
for larger Integrated Systems the

33
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,938
guardian uses the flexible modbus

34
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,740
protocol for easy integration the

35
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,078
guardian is available with full spectrum

36
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,019
or epar sensors and features

37
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,938
maintenance-free VPD measurements

38
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,159
the guardian can be mounted using the

39
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:11,219
included wire hanging kit or by using

40
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,259
the available multi-position Mast mount

41
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,060
the guardian is an all-in-one solution

42
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,159
with reliable measurements that you

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,739
