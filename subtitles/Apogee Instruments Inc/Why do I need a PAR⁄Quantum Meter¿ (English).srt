1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,349
I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments, and this is part of an

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:09,279
ongoing series of principles of environmental measurement. Today we're

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,768
going to talk about measuring light for plant growth in just a short talk. In

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,990
particular, in this talk we're gonna focus on measurements of light for humans, or

5
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:25,768
for people, and measurement of light for plants. Now meters to measure light for

6
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:32,500
plants are more expensive than meters to measure light for people. So, people often

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,128
buy the lower-cost meters to measure light for people, and then use them to measure

8
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:44,039
light for plants. This can result in significant errors if you don't

9
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,589
understand the principles and we're gonna go through these. Here's an example

10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,410
this is a meter to measure light for people, foot-candle meter reads out in

11
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:58,179
foot-candles, here's an Apogee meter looks similar to measure light for

12
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:02,409
plants, and then of course you can buy these with separate sensors, there's a lot of

13
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:09,420
variations, but we're going to focus on the key differences in these. There's a lot

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,200
of terms for this but let's go right to the next slide, blank slide.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:27,960
First, I'm going to draw a line and we're gonna put 400 and 700 nanometers on this line. In

16
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:35,078
between this region are all the colors of light. We go from over here is UV,

17
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:49,239
then we go to blue, green (GRN), red, and then right after this

18
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:55,359
is infrared, and we can't see infrared and plants can't see it. So, both plants

19
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,159
and people see blue, green, and red light.

20
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,960
Here's the difference, if we draw a curve of how well we can see the different

21
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,530
colors of light it looks like this.

22
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:20,709
It's a bell-shaped curve, like this. Let's see if we can get that coming down... okay we see green

23
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:27,610
light more than ten times better than either blue or red light. Now this is

24
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:33,850
designed with people looking in a box at dim light and really it's not

25
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,579
intuitive. The green light looks very bright to us, and blue and red we have to

26
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,219
turn up the intensity so we can see them. So, it's a big difference. Now, plants see all

27
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:56,800
these colors equally. So here's plants and here's people- humans right here.

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:06,590
Now this is Lux, and foot-candles (Fc) these are all the same thing for people, very different

29
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:13,310
shapes of curves as long as the colors didn't change you could measure one and

30
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,549
predict the other from it, but the colors do change when we go from different

31
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:25,040
kinds of light sources. Light for plants is also the same light for any

32
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,979
photosynthetic organisms that includes coral in an aquarium. We're not

33
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:34,289
interested in the colors of light that humans see, we are interested in the

34
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:43,189
colors of light that plants see. So as a dramatic demonstration of this we went

35
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:48,789
to my laboratory at Utah State University where we're doing research on

36
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:56,209
multiple colors of light for plant growth, and we're going to compare quantum

37
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,530
meters that measure light for plants with foot-candle meters that measure light

38
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,370
for people and see the extent to which we can convert back and forth. So let's take

39
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,950
a trip to the lab with this next video

40
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:16,969
and see what this looks like.

41
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:23,770
So you can see all the chambers there. These are all

42
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:28,729
chambers that we used for plants in space. There's a picture of an astronaut that's

43
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,689
holding the plants. These are these little chambers that are on the space station where

44
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,350
we're using LEDs so we want to measure light for plants. Alright now let's take the

45
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:44,430
first, and here's a quantum sensor an Apogee quantum sensor, this is a research grade

46
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,379
foot-candle sensor, this is $1,000 foot-candle sensor to measure light so we got

47
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:56,680
that with perfect accuracy, an excellent accuracy. Then the quantum meter here.

48
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,819
Let's take a look at what we get in the first chamber with cool white fluorescents,

49
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:08,589
every chamber's designed to have

50
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:17,228
200 for quantum flux photosynthetic radiation and then this is what the foot-candles

51
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:22,629
is, now that first chamber was about 1,200 and this was

52
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,819
about 200, so this is about six times as much as this. At the end of this, we'll

53
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,519
come back to these numbers and compare these ratios. Now let's go to the next

54
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:41,949
chamber remember there was a six to one ratio there. Now we close the door about

55
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:53,439
200. Oof, this is almost an eight times ratio in this chamber so this has equal light

56
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,139
for plants, but if you measured it for this you would be way off.

57
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,910
You'd think this should grow better plans and it does not because the ratio

58
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:09,280
changes. Let's keep going with chambers. Now we'll go from a neutral white

59
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,309
LEDs. You can see the color of the warm white LEDs. Close the door.

60
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,649
Keep going just a bit we get there, 200, now look at this

61
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:25,579
1300 here. So yet a different ratio even though the light

62
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:31,459
for the plants is the same. Now, lets take one more chamber.  There was

63
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:36,589
200 and 1300.  Now we're going to take this sensor out of this

64
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:46,098
chamber. You could see the ratio of the two there, and now we're going to go to an

65
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:53,839
LED chamber. This is red and blue LEDs, very commonly used for plants.

66
00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:01,698
Now look at the ratio,  200, whoa! The other ones were 1,200 to 1,600 this is only  six hundred and forty-nine.

67
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:08,280
A foot-candlemeter dramatically under measures LED

68
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,579
lights when they're blue and red LEDs. That shouldn't be surprising because

69
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:19,490
humans don't see red and blue light very efficiently, what we see is green light.

70
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:27,269
So particularly, if there's any LEDs foot-candle meters have huge errors, so this is an

71
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:31,889
example of these measurements very quickly made under different types of

72
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:38,960
lights. Now let's go back to our slide and summarize this data. Now we've

73
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,269
watched this video many times to get these numbers.

74
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:51,370
Here's a summary of the data first cool white. The  PPF was 200, the foot candles

75
00:07:51,370 --> 00:08:00,939
was 1278, and the ratio is 6.4. Now this would be ok if it's always a

76
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:05,139
6.4 ratio we could just measure this and divide by 6.4,

77
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,449
and predict plant growth. Now lets look at  what happens when we do neutral white,

78
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:24,879
PPF 200, boom, this  jumps way up 7.9x. This difference right here is 23%. So using a

79
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,949
foot-candle meter just with cool white and neutral white, 23% error. That's

80
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:38,180
pretty significant. Let's keep going. Warm white, that's in between 12, 15, 13

81
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:46,289
all with the exact same light for plants, different ratios here. So, if

82
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:51,689
20% accuracy was good enough you could get away with the foot-candle

83
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,680
meter, but let's look at LEDs. Remember how low that number was 620, 3.1x

84
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:05,778
this is off by like 100% compared to these other meters, even

85
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:12,509
though this would grow excellent plants. So for any kind of precision work for plants

86
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:18,338
you really need to buy a photosynthetically active radiation meter

87
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:25,279
they're called quantum meters, they're calibrated and designed to measure light

88
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,419
for plants. Think of the investment that people make in growing indoor plants

89
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:36,370
they spend hundreds of dollars on the lights, and without a meter to measure

90
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,929
the lights you can't tell if your lights are aging, you can't tell why the plants

91
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,569
are growing in one place better than another.

92
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:52,390
You really need a quantum sensor or a PPF meter.  Thanks for listening,

93
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,439
we'll talk to you again soon, bye.
