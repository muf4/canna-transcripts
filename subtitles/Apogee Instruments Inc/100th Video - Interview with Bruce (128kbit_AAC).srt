1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,920
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a special guest to celebrate our
100th episode.

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,520
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Bruce with us here today in the
studio.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Ben for setting this up.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thrilled to be here.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we're glad to have you here.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce, some of your videos have done very,
very well and received a lot of attention.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,100
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the video with the most views is
the Canvas Light Myths and Facts video.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has, as of this morning,
just under 3 million views.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,400
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about 50,000 views away from
reaching 3 million views.

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever think you'd have a video with
3 million views, Bruce?

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course not.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,680
[SPEAKER_01]: When things happen in the world,
I guess we could say this went viral,

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,080
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's little tiny things that just
answer a lot of questions for people.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this field, of course, they're
besieged by advertisements from lighting

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,040
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our magic spectra.

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,880
[SPEAKER_01]: In science, we don't have a lot of things
we call magic.

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Science and magic really are counter
points for sure.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the principles, but it's not
like buy this light, it's here's the

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,920
[SPEAKER_01]: guiding principles to figure out what kind
of lighting you need.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you figure it out from the
principles.

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,060
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me lots of strange things.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I heard that you should always
plant at the full moon.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't tell them that's crazy.

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them, well, we don't have any data
to support that.

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and we get sometimes into it that
doesn't the lunar pole do something to

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,400
[SPEAKER_01]: water?

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, but these are super minor things
and there's a lot of dietists like that.

29
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,620
[SPEAKER_01]: There's thousands of diet books and people
swear by certain diets.

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with nutrition implants.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,780
[SPEAKER_01]: They swear by certain ratios of nutrition.

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas we go by just principles of
nutrition.

33
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is just consistent with the
principles that we know.

34
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Bruce, this is our 100th video.

35
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And so along the way, is there any moments
that kind of stand out from filming these

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,240
[SPEAKER_00]: videos?

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly one of them is that myths of
cannabis lighting video that went viral.

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,100
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first experience of something
doing something that became popular.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you realize that it's not just a
number on the screen, but if one percent

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,000
[SPEAKER_01]: of those people send me emails,
I get a lot of emails.

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just elaborate on this?

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't possibly respond to all of
them.

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So my graduate students reply.

44
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led to us teaching a course at
the university.

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting ready to teach the third
edition of this now.

46
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,160
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the Science and Technology of
Medical Cannabis Cultivation.

47
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been a big hit with people that
really want to dig deep and get into the

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,460
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology and genetics of cannabis.

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,020
[SPEAKER_00]: A deeper level.

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,400
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it, Bruce, that you kind of got
into research and studying and even

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,220
[SPEAKER_00]: starting a company and building sensors?

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,280
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that all happen?

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,740
[SPEAKER_01]: People sometimes have asked how do I get
started in what I do.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew up in a very rural area of
Minnesota, Painsville, Minnesota.

55
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked on farms as a kid,
but my family ran a resort, a family

56
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,700
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurial thing, and everybody
worked in the resort.

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't agriculture.

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until I got to college.

59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I started college in engineering because I
was good at math in high school,

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,460
[SPEAKER_01]: so you do engineering and mechanical and
electrical.

61
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:06,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, the students I was there
with were pretty straight arrow engineers.

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,640
[SPEAKER_01]: The stereotype is a white shirt and a
narrow black tie or something.

63
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sharp pencils.

64
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Pocket pull-up pencils and maybe a pocket
protector and all that stuff.

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:25,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a class in plant biology,
and the subject matter fascinated me,

66
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,100
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think I was also drawn by the kind
of students that were in that class.

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,840
[SPEAKER_01]: They were interested in ecology and lots
of different things.

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:44,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And I changed my major at some point and
started to just do more plant biology.

69
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:52,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to graduate school in
plant biology horticulture.

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And more specifically, I always wanted to
go to California.

71
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,720
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just mystique of there's no
absolute truths in California.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,920
[SPEAKER_01]: We reevaluate everything every day.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,260
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me as a teenager was really
interesting.

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,380
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got into UC Davis to graduate school,
and then I really dug into physiology and

75
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,600
[SPEAKER_01]: things.

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,320
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was always interested in controlled
environments.

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it was a synthesis of the
engineering.

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,100
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you build a box to control the
environment to make plants grow faster?

79
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so intriguing with the control
systems.

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then, it wasn't a thing to grow
food indoors.

81
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,160
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a research tool.

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We build these and we'll understand how to
modify the environment, how do plants

83
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,000
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to the environment.

84
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,100
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all about that.

85
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And, oh gosh, I wrote a paper in a class
on this specialized greenhouse.

86
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the Morning Glory
Greenhouse.

87
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,180
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had big reflective panels that
closed at night and opened in the day.

88
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all the energy, and it produced
a lot of heat because it reflected in.

89
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could heat all these buildings
with the heat.

90
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at night, they closed.

91
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And that paper, which was for a class,
got picked up by a journal called

92
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternative Sources of Energy.

93
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, we'd like to publish this
paper.

94
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was before computers, and it had
all these calculations and hand-drawn

95
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,780
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.

96
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And that got published.

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,340
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first publication.

98
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that led to me getting an offer for
an assistantship, a research assistantship

99
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,140
[SPEAKER_01]: at Penn State University.

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,900
[SPEAKER_01]: So off I go between California and
Pennsylvania to get a PhD.

101
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was focused on controlled
environment agriculture.

102
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led to me getting a position at
Utah State University coming here.

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have more money to do more things.

104
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,140
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a big grant funded by NASA early in
my career, and that launched a lot of

105
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,420
[SPEAKER_01]: things.

106
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, wow, we're doing this stuff for NASA.

107
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:11,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the way, measuring light was huge
because of all the environmental

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,240
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters.

109
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We can measure temperature, humidity,
CO2 better than the plants can sense them.

110
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But light, the plants sense that better
than our best instruments.

111
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So, wow, there was a really great
opportunity to do precision light

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,460
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement.

113
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sensors were expensive.

114
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, I'm going to fiddle
around with this.

115
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So I built, not even in my garage at my
kitchen table, built some light meters

116
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,020
[SPEAKER_01]: with photodiodes and modified voltmeters.

117
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just built them for my lab.

118
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a background understanding of
electronics?

119
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I had enough of an engineering background.

120
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I knew the basics of, I knew Ohm's
law.

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,520
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you mean?

122
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Vehicles IR.

123
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I do resistors?

124
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,220
[SPEAKER_01]: So people came to visit the lab,
and we had these sensors.

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, well, they were friends,
and could you build me one?

126
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

127
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So I built them one.

128
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I start to get phone calls from
people saying, I just saw this sensor,

129
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,100
[SPEAKER_01]: this meter in somebody's lab, and it's
terrific.

130
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you build me one?

131
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know me, but I'll pay for
it.

132
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to the university, and I said,
well, there's a market here for these

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,940
[SPEAKER_01]: meters.

134
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to build them the meters at
home and sell them, and I'd like to set up

135
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,320
[SPEAKER_01]: a separate account to keep track of the
money.

136
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And the university said, no, you can't do
that.

137
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,440
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want the liability issues,
and we don't want the criticism that we're

138
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,520
[SPEAKER_01]: competing unfairly.

139
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

140
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,000
[SPEAKER_01]: But the solution is we'll have to start a
company, and we'll give you space in our

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,760
[SPEAKER_01]: research park.

142
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.

143
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And cool.

144
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,800
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what that meant?

145
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,480
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take half the money.

146
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:58,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, now I'm going to keep making
them at my kitchen table.

148
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,400
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need you.

149
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty good at that point.

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we go.

151
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it grew, and I had to build a new
garage much bigger.

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were in my garage for eight or ten
years.

153
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And we weren't trying to grow fast,
and then we just got too big.

154
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we built this much nicer
building, and it's gone from there.

155
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no bank loan.

156
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,700
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no investors.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I put thousands of dollars of my own money
into it.

158
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a bank loan to pay back.

159
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:43,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, the whole company and
all the early employees started just with

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
[SPEAKER_01]: a passion to build good meters.

161
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,060
[SPEAKER_00]: People really like your cannabis videos.

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get involved with cannabis?

163
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had a reputation for doing
precise work in highly controlled

164
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:04,840
[SPEAKER_01]: environments, cannabis growers came to us
and said, in North America and the United

165
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,940
[SPEAKER_01]: States, we need help growing a better
quality crop.

166
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,540
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all the infrastructure to do
this.

167
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we give you funding to do cannabis?

168
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And until 2018, the university,
my lab at the university said,

169
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,380
[SPEAKER_01]: no, we can't take their money.

170
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,140
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal.

171
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,780
[SPEAKER_01]: It's federally illegal.

172
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get in big trouble.

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So in December 2017, I think that was the
exact month and year the farm bill passed,

174
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,040
[SPEAKER_01]: and it made low THC cannabis legal,
federally legal.

175
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's commonly called hemp,
but we just call it low THC cannabis.

176
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,900
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get high from it.

177
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that moment, the university said,
okay, now we'll take the money to work on

178
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,580
[SPEAKER_01]: low THC cannabis.

179
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a license both from the state
of Utah and from the USDA to do this and

180
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,220
[SPEAKER_01]: much more security, things like that.

181
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Off we go with funding from growers,
because at the time there's no federal

182
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,860
[SPEAKER_01]: funding.

183
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no state funding.

184
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,140
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a normal place.

185
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,800
[SPEAKER_01]: People like me get money.

186
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,940
[SPEAKER_01]: It's public agencies.

187
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,600
[SPEAKER_01]: These are private companies.

188
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Started doing a lot of research,
applying all the things we know to

189
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,980
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.

190
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And, well, some of my colleagues said,
oh, my, this is a brand new crop.

191
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,660
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting from zero.

192
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,260
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, no, this is the crop like any
other.

193
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,780
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the same biochemistry.

194
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,040
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the same photoperiod requirements.

195
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the things that are unique.

196
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps us focus the research on
things that we didn't know that were

197
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,580
[SPEAKER_01]: different.

198
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, that led to some pretty
rapid progress in publications.

199
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty soon you're getting invited to
conferences to speak on this, because you

200
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,480
[SPEAKER_01]: went from nothing to the expert,
because the bar was so low.

201
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,800
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't anybody else working on this
at universities.

202
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big jump start for the
cannabis research.

203
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have continued to do the NASA
research all along, but the NASA research

204
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,340
[SPEAKER_01]: is purely food crops, and the cannabis
research is just cannabis.

205
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So through your research, did you ever
have something that popped up?

206
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, this is interesting.

207
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think the public thinks science
progresses when people say, eureka,

208
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it.

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not true.

210
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,580
[SPEAKER_01]: The phrase that I think is the most common
is looking at data and go, hmm,

211
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,580
[SPEAKER_01]: that's funny.

212
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did this happen like this?

213
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ability to say, this is not
just experimental error.

214
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,840
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something here that's real.

215
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any of those moments?

216
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they happen all the time.

217
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,280
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time.

218
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorite quotes is from
Louis Pasteur.

219
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,620
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, chance favors the prepared mind.

220
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you know what you're looking
for, you look at patterns of data and

221
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,920
[SPEAKER_01]: separate experimental error from novel
responses.

222
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bruce, right now, as a researcher and
the owner of Apogee, what kind of

223
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,980
[SPEAKER_00]: questions do you have at night?

224
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,700
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of things keep you up?

225
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, many.

226
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:34,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're often driven by growers that
they call with things that can't be

227
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,720
[SPEAKER_01]: explained.

228
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them you can explain,
many you can, but their responses you

229
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,180
[SPEAKER_01]: can't explain.

230
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't always your own data,
it's somebody else's data that we're

231
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,560
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing this.

232
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those lead us to do tests on those
things, which of course helps those

233
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,740
[SPEAKER_01]: growers enormously.

234
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,860
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of complex interactions.

235
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a really good example.

236
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:10,140
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew from reading the literature from
60 to 70 years ago that there was evidence

237
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,500
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis was exceptionally sensitive
to light pollution.

238
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people can sleep with the lights on,
some people can't.

239
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have it all dark,
so it's intuitive.

240
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some plants they can have the lights
on, it doesn't matter, and some plants got

241
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,560
[SPEAKER_01]: to have it dark.

242
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it suggested cannabis was
exquisitely sensitive to light pollution.

243
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start doing some tests and,
wow, we confirm this old research,

244
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,800
[SPEAKER_01]: which hasn't been done for a while,
it's really sensitive.

245
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how are you going to measure this
with those instruments?

246
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So that led to apogee building,
this light pollution detector.

247
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so that's where that came from.

248
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody measures light in what we
call micromoles.

249
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10 to the minus 6 moles.

250
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,620
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, we build a meter to
measure nanomoles, 10 to the minus 9,

251
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,300
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand times more sensitive,
to measure these and quantify them.

252
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been a huge help to growers who
need what we call reagent-grade darkness

253
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,640
[SPEAKER_01]: at night.

254
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting term that we coined.

255
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Poinsettia is a real sensitive crop to
light pollution, too, to make the bracts

256
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,980
[SPEAKER_01]: turn red.

257
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,360
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real common crop.

258
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always said they are our most
sensitive crop, but now we've shown

259
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,280
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis even more sensitive.

260
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for watching.

261
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bruce, for taking the time and
filming with me for a little bit.

262
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,180
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about Bruce and
his research, click on this playlist,

263
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,480
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll show you more of the things that
he's taught us, and you can learn a lot

264
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,160
[SPEAKER_00]: from him as well.

265
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for coming,
Bruce.

266
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ben.

267
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,460
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you later.

268
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:50,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

269
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
