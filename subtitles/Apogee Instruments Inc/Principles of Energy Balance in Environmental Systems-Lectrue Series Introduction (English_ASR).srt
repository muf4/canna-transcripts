1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm Bruce bugby and this is an

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:12,559
introduction to a seven lecture series

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,519
on the principles of energy balance in

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,320
environmental systems so what in this

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:22,600
overview I'm going to go through what

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,240
each of the lectures discusses to give

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,640
you the opportunity to skip to certain

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,159
lectures and go back and review specific

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,439
things so you know exactly what's in

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,159
each of the seven

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,640
lectures

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,000
so here's the first lecture that's got a

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,000
detailed

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,960
outline in that lecture I give an

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,399
introduction to water use and

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,280
agriculture water in agriculture uses at

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,480
least 70% of the water in the nation and

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,359
where does all that water go that's the

19
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:01,718
huge criteria here and then secondly how

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,478
do we exactly measure how much of that

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,439
water is used by agriculture the answer

22
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,879
is we use principles of energy balance

23
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,279
so this is tells the challenge of this

24
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,599
whole thing and the importance of it I

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,920
review several reference books on this

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,879
one of them we use as a textbook for

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,118
this class then we get into this first

28
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,319
law of

29
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,920
thermodynamics the seven components

30
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,399
latent heat of

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,399
evaporation understanding energy and

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,840
power this is jewels and watts and

33
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,359
finally short and long wave radiation

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,640
and then we give you homework and the

35
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:43,039
first homework is e equal

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,000
mc^2 homework that's lecture one to let

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,560
you go quickly to that and see what's in

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,920
there now let's take a look at lecture

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,519
two talked about the key for the

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,519
homework how to calculate the energy in

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:02,798
a p seed of units of conversions capital

42
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,798
c for calories lower case then we

43
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,240
calculate the efficiency of

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,200
photosynthesis and show that this is

45
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:13,598
really so small we can ignore it in

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,518
these principles finally absorbed

47
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:20,919
shortwave radiation and the importance

48
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:24,400
of albo the three component parts of

49
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,559
shortwave radiation UV photosynthetic

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
and near

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,280
infrared definitions what is shortwave

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,160
what's longwave

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,959
and then we introduce the Stefan

54
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,318
boltzman law for shortwave radiation

55
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,080
that's the end of lecture

56
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:44,839
two lecture

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,239
three gets us into

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,840
the concept of

59
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,319
emissivity let's see if I can Center

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,439
these right there concept of emissivity

61
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,878
this is about longwave radiation

62
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,800
calculating longwave emitted net long

63
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,399
wave and then finally bringing all the

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,519
radiation together in lecture three Net

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,319
absorbed shortwave and net absorbed long

66
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,200
wave so this is the end of the

67
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,798
principles in the three lectures then we

68
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,119
open lecture

69
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:23,159
four applying energy balance principles

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,319
to the planet Earth and this also gets

71
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:29,479
into what's the is the energy balanced

72
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:32,359
perfectly on the earth or is the Earth's

73
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:34,759
life L warming and this really helps you

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,959
understand the challenge of accurately

75
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,919
measuring small amounts of global

76
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,438
warming and the best Minds in the planet

77
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,318
are working on this

78
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,598
now then we get into differential

79
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,399
absorption of short and longwave

80
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,158
radiation not all the wavelengths are

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,000
the same reflectance of longwave

82
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:58,158
radiation a tiny bit is reflected and

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,840
then two critical equations that apply

84
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:04,438
to these types of radiation one is Wan's

85
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,360
law and the second one is Plank's law

86
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,359
that's the end of the fourth

87
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:19,199
lecture lecture

88
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,439
five we focus on transpiration now we

89
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:26,199
have net radiation in here the whole

90
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:29,800
lecture is all on how we calculate

91
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,360
transpiration which is the flux of water

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,560
and the and transpiration is determined

93
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,919
by the driving gradient for

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,199
transpiration for evaporation divided by

95
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,478
the resistance to flow of these water

96
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,319
molecules out into the

97
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:49,120
atmosphere we we discuss absolute and

98
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,959
relative humidity that's critical to

99
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,399
understanding those two the flux

100
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,319
calculating the driving gradient

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,239
determining stodal conductance and

102
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,360
finally modeling it that's all in

103
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,079
lecture five lecture six I'll move it up

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,280
just a

105
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,240
bit conduction and convection the next

106
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,959
big component part of this hot air

107
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,720
blowing away hot surfaces blowing away

108
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,799
to cold surfaces that's driven by

109
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,919
boundary layer resistance or boundary

110
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,960
layer conductance and so how do we

111
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:26,758
measure that and how do we model the

112
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:30,198
movement Heat by conduction and

113
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,919
convection these components then

114
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,960
compromise the whole energy balance

115
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,879
equation and the component parts and in

116
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,638
the end the goal is to calculate the

117
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:45,639
movement of water through the system

118
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:50,560
lecture seven the last and final lecture

119
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,560
is a summary and application of the

120
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,520
principles so we look at Water movement

121
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,000
in the day but what happens at night now

122
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:04,079
the sun sets and all of the

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
surfaces get colder than the air

124
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,120
temperature on a clear night they

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,560
radiate to the sky and we get radiation

126
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,840
Frost things freeze even when the air

127
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
temperature is not freezing we go

128
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:21,159
through those and then finally a summary

129
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,280
of how do these principles apply to the

130
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,560
very famous Penman mon teeth equation

131
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:30,198
and how do we use that to model

132
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,959
transpiration rates and then finally the

133
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,680
much simpler Hargraves equation which is

134
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,198
elegant in its

135
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,280
Simplicity um and almost as accurate as

136
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,639
the Penman mon teeth so this is a

137
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:48,239
summary lecture of all the six of all

138
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,360
the principles of energy balance so with

139
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,598
this

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,960
introduction you can skip around to the

141
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:58,959
lectures and look at the ones that you

142
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:01,359
uh are most interested in um they

143
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,279
generally build on each other but it's

144
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,520
not required that you go through an

145
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:09,239
order CU I we expect all the viewers are

146
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,560
going to have different backgrounds and

147
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,720
certain component parts are going to be

148
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,839
more important than others thanks for

149
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,840
listening and let the lectures

150
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,839
begin
