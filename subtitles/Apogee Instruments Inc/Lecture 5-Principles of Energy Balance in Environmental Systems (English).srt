1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,230
sure number five and now we are finally

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:14,070
moving past just radiation into the next

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,048
component of this whole thing and we're

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,140
at in this outline we're at number five

5
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,550
now these are complex lectures it looks

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,859
like we're half done but we're really

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,490
more like two thirds of three fourths

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,090
done in this but transpiration all by

9
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:32,278
itself as I said before we talked about

10
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,229
doing that by subtraction can't we just

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,739
measure it directly and the answer is

12
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,689
yes

13
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,659
sort of and that's what I want to talk

14
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:42,359
about is how we can do transpiration as

15
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,369
a direct measurement now the first thing

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,079
you run into when you we've simplified

17
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,030
this thing because we've got all this

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,770
other stuff feeding into this one number

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,629
right here is latent heat and sensible

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,070
heat and you hear those terms all the

21
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:02,399
time and it's easy to get them confused

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:06,960
latent heat always refers to evaporation

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,930
of water for cooling and sensible heat

24
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,139
just means dry heat there's no water

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,680
involved so where did we come up with

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,368
these terms I haven't studied the

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,118
etiology of them but sensible heat makes

28
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:24,090
sense

29
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,340
hot objects cool they'd get cooler

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,829
that's easy to understand

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:34,859
so it's sensible latent heat the object

32
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,199
sitting there and you shine a much

33
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,618
brighter light on it and the temperature

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,649
doesn't change that doesn't make sense

35
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,719
it can't be sensible heat it only

36
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,509
changes temperature after the water

37
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,688
evaporates the water evaporates and then

38
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,750
it cools so it's latent it's a it's

39
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:57,148
after the fact that cooling that helps

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,009
to keep these terms because if you get

41
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,689
into this business and people quickly

42
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,709
start throwing these terms around and

43
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,718
you want to keep up with the

44
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:10,049
conversation so both of these are

45
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:13,008
governed by the exact same basic

46
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,009
principle

47
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:26,379
flux is driving gradient by resistance

48
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,580
in the case of latent heat the flux is

49
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:36,490
transpiration

50
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:42,600
so we'll put grams of water per meter

51
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:48,030
squared per second equals a

52
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:51,879
dimensionless driving gradient so DG

53
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,819
over resistance and the resistance is

54
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,729
the Stowe mates are they closed or they

55
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,949
open how open are the store mates so

56
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:02,729
it's just a ratio of these two things

57
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:06,969
that quantitatively determine

58
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:10,439
transpiration and then remember as soon

59
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:13,870
as we do weight of water through that

60
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:18,840
2.45 mega joules per liter that you're

61
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:22,569
all remembering we get milliliters of

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:29,650
water per meter squared per second or we

63
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:34,299
get joules of energy sensible heat same

64
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:40,030
thing only we get joules of cooling now

65
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:42,520
the num denominator here is Delta t it's

66
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,140
just simple it's just the temperature

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,650
between the two objects and similarly

68
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:53,169
this is divided by resistance only over

69
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,170
here mostly this resistance is how fast

70
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:59,349
the wind is blowing is the dominant

71
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,839
factor here this resistance is how open

72
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:05,500
the store mates are to let the water

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:10,180
vapor out so the concepts are exactly

74
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:15,729
the same so now what we want to start

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:20,129
with is this driving gradient right here

76
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,129
I will erase that we're coming to that

77
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:27,189
let me erase all of this how do we

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,550
calculate that driving gradient if you

79
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:34,769
ask most people they would say well duh

80
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,770
how easy is that it's relative humidity

81
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:41,949
okay so most people think this is

82
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:43,478
relative humidity on this and if the

83
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,000
relative humidity is low stuff

84
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:50,740
evaporates faster the tie it evaporates

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,120
slower but it's not relative humidity

86
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,910
it's absolute humidity and this gets

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,660
back and forth for all kinds of gases

88
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:04,389
absolute humidity is the absolute number

89
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,830
of water vapor molecules in the air

90
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:11,050
that's pretty simple relative is the

91
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:15,788
ratio of how much water is in the air

92
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:19,300
divided by what it could hold so if the

93
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:22,569
air is hot it can hold a lot of water

94
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:28,569
vapor and the relative humidity goes

95
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:32,439
down in this room if we had a hundred

96
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:36,550
water vapor molecules and the humidity

97
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,288
was 50% if we heated up the room we

98
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,478
would still have a hundred water vapor

99
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:42,788
molecules and the Hidde tea humidity

100
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,550
might be ten percent because the air

101
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:49,598
could hold more water so this

102
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,848
distinction is critical in intuitively

103
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:58,959
understanding the driving gradient for

104
00:05:51,848 --> 00:06:04,569
this and the best way then I have seen

105
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:07,680
to explain this is a thing called the

106
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,680
psychometric chart

107
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:21,899
and some of you may have seen this I'm

108
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:24,120
going now I think maybe I don't have

109
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,509
plenty maybe just just I thought I had

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,459
plenty you could take two of these but

111
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:32,599
one to write on one to keep if you type

112
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:35,519
psychometric chart on the internet

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:42,210
you're going to get hundreds and

114
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:47,549
hundreds of versions of this chart in

115
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:51,509
metric units and Old English units but

116
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:56,129
this is the standard chart for standard

117
00:06:51,509 --> 00:07:00,120
temperatures that the x-axis is air

118
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:02,430
temperature it goes from minus 20 to

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,160
plus 50 on this chart so we've pretty

120
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,019
much covered the environmental range on

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,180
this chart never mind this little

122
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:15,978
subsection right here let's focus on

123
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:21,389
this for starters this shows five

124
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:25,050
parameters of water vapor in the air and

125
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:33,030
if you know any two of those five you

126
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:34,680
can calculate the other three so I can't

127
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:42,239
quite right on this screen but I can

128
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:44,910
draw it on here I'm going to simulate

129
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,829
this and sometimes the simulation is

130
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:53,550
good because it'll be more simple here's

131
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:58,978
the basic chart so these tick marks down

132
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,960
here are air temperature and almost

133
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:03,240
always in practice that's one of the

134
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,829
things you know usually you don't

135
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,810
measure water vapor to back calculate

136
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:12,689
air temperature most the time you know

137
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:16,129
that these curves here in the middle are

138
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,129
relative humidity

139
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:24,870
our H all these curved lines like this

140
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,228
so let's take an example where we know

141
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:31,288
air temperature and humidity and see

142
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:39,598
what we can calculate from that so let's

143
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:45,659
say this room is 25 C and the humidity

144
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:50,610
is 30% here this is Utah it's dry air so

145
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:56,490
if we go in this chart and find 30

146
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:59,009
percent here's 25 C now this the

147
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,080
important line is just a tiny bit past

148
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:05,100
the number it's a tiny bit boldface

149
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:09,810
and we go up up up up up till we get to

150
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,330
30 right there is the point note that

151
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:16,439
you want to draw a dot where those

152
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:24,389
humidity and temperature intersect and

153
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:28,829
I'll draw it on here now if we go to the

154
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:33,269
right in a straight line I simplify this

155
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:34,979
a little right here and we find the tick

156
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,740
mark on the right hand side of the graph

157
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,120
from this going right straight across

158
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,610
and now let me see if I can do this

159
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,209
right on the screen 25 and 30 if I go

160
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:53,909
right straight across I'm getting seven

161
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:56,449
and I think that's pretty 30 nope nope

162
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,449
25

163
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,490
30 I'm getting a little more than that

164
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:08,370
I'm getting seven and a half for them

165
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:11,519
going right straight across you can see

166
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:18,899
what the units are of that absolute

167
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:24,389
humidity grams per kilogram of air very

168
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:30,990
different unit than relative humidity at

169
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:38,279
our elevation this is not on this chart

170
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:40,560
but at our elevation at 1500 meters by

171
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,529
the way this is a chart for our

172
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,589
elevation this is for 1,500 meters we

173
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:54,559
made this I made this just for this

174
00:10:46,590 --> 00:11:03,060
glass one kilogram of air equals one

175
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:08,429
cubic meter of air so this is also 7.5

176
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:13,559
grams per cubic meter that only in Logan

177
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:17,759
sea level this is 1.2 kilograms per

178
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:20,129
cubic metre this same chart is available

179
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,649
for all different elevations and they

180
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:24,750
are very similar if I overlay them on

181
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,679
here if you if you looked at two you

182
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,960
wouldn't be able to tell the difference

183
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,059
if you lay them on top of each other you

184
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,700
can see little differences but the

185
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:37,379
biggest differences is the density the

186
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:40,020
air and this g/kg is is valid for all

187
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,389
different elevations this is the

188
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,159
absolute humidity how much water vapor

189
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:47,460
is in the air if we took a cubic meter

190
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,980
of air and condensed all the water out

191
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,590
of it typically meters pretty big we'd

192
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,950
only get seven point five grams of water

193
00:11:52,590 --> 00:12:00,530
that's the absolute humidity if you look

194
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:04,070
carefully over here the second column is

195
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:09,078
dew point temperature

196
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:15,769
now I promised five things from this so

197
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:20,799
here's one air temperature - is relative

198
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:28,549
humidity three it's absolute humidity

199
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:33,318
ABS H um the fourth one goes this

200
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:36,409
direction right from that point and it's

201
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:41,149
where this intersects this curve right

202
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:45,769
here and then they then you take that

203
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:47,899
point and go down that to the

204
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,448
temperature the temperature is listed

205
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:54,009
both on this and this but this point

206
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:54,008
right here is the dew point

207
00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:04,529
of the air let me see whenever yet we're

208
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:07,049
number four dew point of the air this is

209
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:10,769
a very big deal because this is where

210
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:16,379
water changes state from a gas to a

211
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:18,509
liquid if we are below the dew point the

212
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,929
water is going to just keep condensing

213
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:24,120
on that surface and actually until the

214
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:25,889
surface finally warms up but that's how

215
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,899
air conditioners work they have a cold

216
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,449
surface and they the water condenses

217
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,600
takes it out of the air if it's above

218
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:38,490
this point water will never condense on

219
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,830
that surface so what do we get for dew

220
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:48,899
point here if you're following along 25

221
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:53,280
and 30 25 30 looks like I'm getting

222
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:55,679
about six seven maybe six or seven

223
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,959
degrees is that if we go straight across

224
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:05,689
here going if I know maybe maybe seven

225
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:09,900
degrees nope six anyway

226
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:16,220
let's let's call this six degree C for

227
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:20,519
our example what if we take a can of

228
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,310
soda or beer out of the fridge and let

229
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:27,299
it sit in this room what's the

230
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:30,000
temperature of a refrigerator three two

231
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:33,240
three four degrees C water is going to

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,529
condense on it because it's below the

233
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,509
dew point of the air and after a few

234
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,480
minutes it warms up and that water

235
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:43,830
evaporates again and there's no water

236
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,450
condensing on it that's the concept of

237
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:52,110
dew point of the air you get up in the

238
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:55,020
morning of a cold winter night and water

239
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,360
is condensing on your windows that's

240
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,569
because that window temperature is below

241
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,029
the dew point of the air so you get

242
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,830
condensation on it

243
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:08,959
in the case of leaves they can get they

244
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:13,100
can cool at night below the dew point

245
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,440
and water condenses on leaves that's bad

246
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,649
news because bacteria go wild when

247
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,370
there's water condensed on leaves so our

248
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:23,959
models make all these measurements

249
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,060
calculate dew point and particularly the

250
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,879
dew point to the leaves and if water is

251
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:31,639
condensing we send a red alert to the

252
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,340
plant pathologists and people and they

253
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,470
they have disease forecasts based on the

254
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,990
number of hours below the dew point of

255
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,980
the air but it's based on other

256
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:46,310
measurements in a calculated dew point

257
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:48,889
so and come back to the value of each of

258
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:53,479
these parameters in a minute but first I

259
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,699
promised five things the fifth one is

260
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,310
shown here

261
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,250
there's no tick marks on this see these

262
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:05,799
lines go in the opposite direction of

263
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:08,960
everything this we can go right up here

264
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:14,199
relative humidity is two we go right up

265
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:17,889
here and this temperature is the wet

266
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,890
bulb temperature

267
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:29,459
right there and these all go both ways

268
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:31,079
these are all if you know this you go

269
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:35,129
this way these are all double-ended

270
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:39,170
aerial arrows so what good is the

271
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:42,149
wet-bulb temperature what does that mean

272
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:45,620
this means the temperature that a wet

273
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:51,449
surface would get to in these conditions

274
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:54,509
if it's if it's a wet dishrag rollin wet

275
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,990
how and it's evaporating like crazy

276
00:16:54,509 --> 00:17:02,879
how cold would it get so let's see if we

277
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:07,019
can calculate wet bulb from this 25 up

278
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,819
to 30 now we go this way and it looks

279
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:13,078
like the wet bulb temperature is about

280
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:21,419
thirteen point five so in these

281
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:26,698
conditions thirteen point five see what

282
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:29,100
this means is a wet dishrag would cool

283
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,470
the thirteen point five C and as long as

284
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:36,959
it stayed wet it would stay at this

285
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:39,750
temperature well irrigated leaves could

286
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,870
get to this temperature too if they're

287
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:45,210
act like a wet dishrag they could cool

288
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:49,049
to this and look at that air temperature

289
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:51,450
is twenty-five and a wet surface would

290
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:54,149
cool took roughly thirteen it's a lot of

291
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,670
cooling but it's low humidity now you

292
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,710
can quickly run the model and say oh

293
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:02,460
what would it be if it was eighty

294
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:07,170
percent humidity and all we have to do

295
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,400
is go up to 80 up here and now the wet

296
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,220
bulb temperature is something like

297
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,070
twenty two and it's much closer to air

298
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,759
temperature and the dew point something

299
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:21,450
like twenty one if they if we move in up

300
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:24,420
here in this humidity line so the

301
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:28,110
absolute humidity is a function of both

302
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,420
relative humidity and temperature now

303
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:34,638
what we want to calculate is not just

304
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:38,460
absolute humidity but this

305
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:46,229
driving gradient and the graving

306
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:49,009
gradient is let me draw this right here

307
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,009
in green

308
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:59,429
this is a picture of one storm ate a

309
00:18:56,308 --> 00:19:01,888
giant storm ate on the bottom of the

310
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:05,309
leaf remember we drew this the other day

311
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:07,798
we had various cells out here and here's

312
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:12,808
the whole leaf with all the cells

313
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:14,908
now there's two cells right here that

314
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:17,308
are called guard cells and they're just

315
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:19,110
exactly like a port with ships going in

316
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:21,869
and out and these guard cells are always

317
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:27,329
going back and forth to restrict the

318
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:31,849
size of this opening but the driving

319
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:34,500
gradient for humidity I'm going to put

320
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:38,058
h4 I could say aah

321
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:44,519
let me say aah absolute humidity I

322
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:48,168
inside the leaf - absolute humidity in

323
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,169
the air

324
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:55,349
this one is not difficult to get but we

325
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,759
put our instruments on it and usually

326
00:19:55,349 --> 00:20:01,509
we're getting relative humidity and

327
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,769
temperature going this way and in inside

328
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:05,859
the data logger and we're calculating

329
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:11,349
this absolute humidity so we know this

330
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:15,009
one how do we a human inside the leaf we

331
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:22,059
know that any belief that is not wilted

332
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:23,129
that is hydrated is 100 percent relative

333
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:27,399
humidity

334
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:32,320
it might be 99 percent but it's very

335
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:35,700
close to a hundred so now if we know

336
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:38,349
leaf temperature and for this example

337
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:42,160
let's say that the leaf temperature the

338
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:45,969
air is 25 we just did that now let's say

339
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,300
the leaf is 25 these happen to be at the

340
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:53,519
exact same temperature in this example

341
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:56,440
now we can go from air temperature here

342
00:20:53,519 --> 00:21:00,129
straight up to a hundred percent

343
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,320
humidity just it's Leafs the same

344
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:08,860
temperature so our leaf right here

345
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:13,839
you know EAF is right there now we go

346
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:16,839
from the leaf over here and we get a

347
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,829
number for the absolute humidity the

348
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,240
water vapor density inside that leaf and

349
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:26,069
let's see if we can do that in this

350
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,069
example 25

351
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,569
I'm right well them right here I can

352
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:35,419
take the tick mark right off of this

353
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:38,009
it's the same tick mark I go over here

354
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:42,509
straight across and I'm getting twenty

355
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:44,190
four point two maybe if the leaf is 100

356
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:47,339
percent humidity this line right here is

357
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:54,750
100 percent humidity so we're getting

358
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:57,929
twenty four point two inside the leaf so

359
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:02,190
now we have get rid of our hundred

360
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:10,500
percent twenty four point two and the

361
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:15,840
air is seven point five this driving

362
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:26,660
gradient is twenty four point two minus

363
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:26,659
seven point five with units of grams

364
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:37,089
per kilogram so whatever this

365
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,640
subtraction is exactly what is that 16

366
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:43,240
or something 17 about 17 grams per

367
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,050
kilogram

368
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,839
that is the absolute of humidity inside

369
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,149
the leaf minus the absolute humidity air

370
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,839
that's the driving gradient for

371
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:58,750
transpiration now what if the leaf

372
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,869
starts to run out of water just a little

373
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:05,109
bit it's not as well hydrated it can't

374
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:08,019
keep up this it it it can't balance the

375
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:10,599
energy by evaporating water the leaf

376
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:13,480
gets hotter let's say the leaf gets

377
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,939
three degrees hotter than the air it's

378
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,110
not wilted yet it's just it's just not

379
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:25,750
the store mates are starting to close

380
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:30,449
now we can do 25 26 27 28 degrees C

381
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:33,869
still 100% humidity now we're at 29

382
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:43,120
inside the leaf if it hot heats up so

383
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:47,199
hot leaf not hot warm leaf 29 - and the

384
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,369
air is still the same 29 minus 7.5 so as

385
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,850
soon as the leaf gets hotter that

386
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:54,099
driving gradient gets bigger now it is

387
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:56,289
possible for really wet leaves to get

388
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,179
below air temperature because that wet

389
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,549
bulb they might get all the way down to

390
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,400
the wet bulb but even there there's a

391
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:06,970
gradient for transpiration but this

392
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:11,250
gradient for transpiration and I'm going

393
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:14,789
to show this in red is always this

394
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,789
difference right here

395
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:23,130
between 100% humidity in the leaf and

396
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:26,260
wherever our point is here in the air

397
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:29,740
there's plenty of computer programs to

398
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:32,500
put stuff in and calculate this stuff

399
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,940
free programs psychometric programs used

400
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,509
to have to pay for them and now they're

401
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,340
free on the internet but none of those

402
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,829
you can use those all day long and you

403
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:43,599
don't see the graphical principles the

404
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:46,990
way you get them with a psychometric

405
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:50,379
chart that's once you see the chart you

406
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:53,230
can understand how these points move to

407
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:57,010
make this absolute humidity change leaf

408
00:24:53,230 --> 00:25:02,230
cooling air humidity temperature

409
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:06,629
changing here's the reason that absolute

410
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:11,679
humidity is such a big deal if I asked

411
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:14,500
we put a dishrag outside when with that

412
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:20,620
with that dishrag dry faster at 30

413
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:26,440
degrees C and 80% humidity or at 5

414
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:28,658
degrees C and 20% humidity now most

415
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,990
people would say about 20% humidity of

416
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:37,559
course it's going to dry faster

417
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:43,589
let's take a look 5 degrees C 20%

418
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:48,750
there's our Delta humidity 30 degrees C

419
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:52,869
phone offenses and we're off chart 80%

420
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:56,619
we're over here it's a bigger gradient

421
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:59,079
for drying at a warm temperature an 80%

422
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:01,719
humidity then it is down here at a low

423
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:04,599
humidity and cold temperatures so this

424
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,220
is real counterintuitive because you got

425
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,839
to think of the combination of air

426
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,980
temperature and humidity when we do

427
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,408
absolute humidity but this these

428
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,079
principles psychometric principles have

429
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:22,110
been around for hundred years and this

430
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:22,109
charts been around for a long time

431
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:28,250
and I worry that we're losing some of

432
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:30,139
the intuitive insights you can get from

433
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:34,269
this chart by once you have it and you

434
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:41,420
see points on this you can see them too

435
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:42,859
this is real simple but to reiterate

436
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,430
what I just said

437
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:54,109
here's another handout that shows these

438
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:55,430
points and two handouts this is just

439
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:58,129
what I wrote on the board with some

440
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:02,930
formal definitions of these things and

441
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:04,310
then a little diagram showing them so

442
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,650
when you get to teaching this to other

443
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:11,829
people you can show them this page and

444
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,830
then to further make sure you have it I

445
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,720
did three worked out examples where you

446
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,970
have a couple different inputs and you

447
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,470
can calculate the other parameters

448
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,950
sometimes you know like I said sometimes

449
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,950
you know one sometimes you know another

450
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,950
so

451
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:41,898
how we measured this through the ages

452
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:46,140
well before we had computers and

453
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:49,398
electronic sensors we had psychrometer

454
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:54,870
x' and this is a you still can buy these

455
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:57,359
it's a wet dry bulb psychrometer and it

456
00:27:54,869 --> 00:28:00,329
doesn't take electricity it doesn't take

457
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,990
a fast microprocessor it is two

458
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:07,980
thermometers one with the wet shoelace

459
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:10,950
over it and one with nothing and so

460
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,919
nothing is dry ball that's where the

461
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,440
word bulb comes from it's the bulb of a

462
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,019
thermometer a mercury or alcohol

463
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,570
thermometer it just means air

464
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,630
temperature and the wet bulb means one

465
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:26,339
has a wick so the difference in

466
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,110
temperature now we get two numbers and

467
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,928
from this instrument we can calculate

468
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:33,509
everything no computer just one piece of

469
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,090
paper and this and we get the

470
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:38,879
temperature reattempt humidity now

471
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:41,939
there's one key thing about this you can

472
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,429
see it pulls apart to get the accurate

473
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,860
wet bulb temperature you have to have a

474
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:48,509
fan blowing on it and fans take

475
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,459
electricity and we don't really want

476
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:53,638
that so we do this and these are called

477
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,470
sling psychrometer x' and i used to pc

478
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:57,750
people's with these in their back pocket

479
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,058
just like the people have carried around

480
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,819
slide rules and they whip this thing

481
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:04,500
around and they'd aspirated in and now

482
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,269
let's suit we got here you can tell me

483
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:11,339
the humidity of the room see if I can

484
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:16,019
read this so that 77 oh my this is in

485
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:23,058
Fahrenheit but 77 25 see so their air

486
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:32,460
dry bulbs 25 and the wet bulb is 59

487
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:34,648
which is 15 Celsius so 25 25 and wet

488
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,279
bulb of 15 and tell me the humidity of

489
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:42,769
this room from your chart

490
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,769
we guess 30 we'll see how close we are

491
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:50,190
37 okay

492
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,700
so again that's these two these two

493
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:57,259
lines here intersecting and then then

494
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:02,759
the curve because this whole thing is

495
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:07,859
nonlinear and because this is all in the

496
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:10,950
days before computers this has a little

497
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:13,109
slide rule on it tick marks and you can

498
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,630
line up the wet and dry bulb and it will

499
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:17,759
tell you the humidity right on this in

500
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:21,390
case you don't have a chart you just do

501
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:23,279
this and these tick marks are nonlinear

502
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,309
because the relationships are nonlinear

503
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:30,298
so this is a self-contained instrument -

504
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:32,629
I do humidity and they come boy you can

505
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:35,429
get them big if you need precision work

506
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:39,510
when I was in beginning and graduate

507
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:41,490
school there were no good electronic

508
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:43,919
community sensors we would take

509
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,349
thermocouples and we'd put a shoelace on

510
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,659
one and a fan or we got wet bulb and dry

511
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:50,308
bulb and that's how we did humidity that

512
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,620
was the state-of-the-art measurement

513
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:53,819
then the wet bulb would get dirty and

514
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:57,119
you had to clean it and it was

515
00:30:53,819 --> 00:31:01,279
complicated but but that's how we did

516
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:05,579
humidity so being a collector of old

517
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,639
instruments I've collected instruments

518
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:11,129
to do this over the years and here's one

519
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,710
of my beauties maybe I should put this

520
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:18,120
in the case here downstairs big

521
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:22,740
reservoir a wet wick and a dry wick and

522
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:25,259
a nonlinear slide rule to get humidity

523
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,419
from the relationships it can slide the

524
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:29,658
points around to get humidity if you

525
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:32,970
don't have a computer handy to do it

526
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:34,620
then instructions on the back for our

527
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,950
owner's manual for how to use that

528
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:40,619
instrument then people got better and we

529
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,330
had bimetallic strips for humidity and

530
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:45,449
temperature here's one with humidity and

531
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:47,519
temperature and the lines cross and this

532
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,350
is a little tiny miniature psychometric

533
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,809
chart with the needles are crossing and

534
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:54,839
you can get absolute humidity so

535
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:58,190
from this so it's a lot of clever things

536
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:01,799
that people did in the days before

537
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:04,080
before we had computers and of course

538
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,649
now slide rules are a completely lost

539
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,659
art but you can still buy a

540
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:12,150
psychrometric slide rule where you get

541
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,509
wet and dry ball then you put it in here

542
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:17,340
and calculate the other humidity print

543
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:21,930
parameters you can calculate relative

544
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:24,569
humidity from wet and dry ball and this

545
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:27,000
is interesting because in the days

546
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:29,609
before computers that's a linear kind of

547
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,640
long you could get a circular slide rule

548
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:34,740
and it's the same thing line these two

549
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,480
points up and line the tick mark to get

550
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,240
humidity and this you could carry on

551
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,660
your back pocket for checking humidity

552
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,970
anywhere no these are all fascinating

553
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,160
instruments based on the human ingenuity

554
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,680
in the days before computers how they

555
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:56,480
dealt with nonlinear stuff like this

556
00:32:49,680 --> 00:33:03,600
chart I think that's the end of my

557
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:07,039
instrument demo on this now let's start

558
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,599
putting numbers in this once we get this

559
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,259
let's see if we can put numbers in this

560
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:15,529
to get this because if we can do this we

561
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,359
don't have to get it by subtraction

562
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:19,740
because we've shown with instruments we

563
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:29,089
can do a pretty good job of measuring

564
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:29,089
this the key for this is this is leaf

565
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:38,019
absolute humidity and air we to be

566
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:41,129
accurate about this we need to know the

567
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:46,230
leaf temperature yep if you do air

568
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:49,240
temperature 100% - air you can have with

569
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,669
significant errors in this depending on

570
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,890
the conditions so we do need to have

571
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:56,020
leaf temperature in this but once we get

572
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,210
this then we have a very accurate

573
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:00,298
measurement of this driving gradient

574
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:14,829
then the rest of it is getting them

575
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:19,500
resistance let's see I'm going to come

576
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:19,500
back to this in a in a second here

577
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,078
let me erase all of this

578
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,140
because

579
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,360
it's by the way you can buy these

580
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:43,279
specialized Fork really cold

581
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,769
temperatures and then combustion

582
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,480
engineers buy them for really hot

583
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:50,539
temperatures for like smokestacks

584
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,420
they're way out here but this is the one

585
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:57,429
for environmental engineers which we're

586
00:34:53,420 --> 00:35:01,909
dealing with environmental temperatures

587
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:05,149
so this is a classic thing a ratio of

588
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:07,879
driving gradient and resistance and

589
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,710
we've got to have the unit's line up in

590
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,019
this thing if this is going to be a flux

591
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:18,010
an amount per unit area per unit time

592
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:21,739
this one has units grams per kilogram

593
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:24,710
but it turns out every time you work

594
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:28,219
this you also have to have a correction

595
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:37,579
for air pressure because that changes

596
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:44,319
the driving gradient so what we do this

597
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:49,099
is mmm last 20 years is calculate a

598
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,480
dimensionless driving gradient so we

599
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:53,690
would like to get this in a

600
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,809
dimensionless term that that we can use

601
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:01,480
to put the numbers in this and to do

602
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:01,480
that we have

603
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:16,019
this gradient right here in expressed in

604
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:16,019
what W water vapor pressure

605
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:27,929
and the amount of water in the air

606
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:33,749
creates a vapor pressure so and we know

607
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:36,659
that from PV from beginning chemistry if

608
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:38,759
we know the number of molecules in the

609
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,420
air it's directly proportional to those

610
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:44,009
pressure of those molecules in the air

611
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,380
so when you see people talking about

612
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:48,989
humidity you do not hear them talking

613
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,778
about oh there was grams per kilogram in

614
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:58,230
the air we talked about vapor pressure

615
00:36:51,778 --> 00:37:00,809
of the water in the air and this is a

616
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,599
direct relationship between number of

617
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:07,940
molecules or weight and the pressure and

618
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:11,849
the pressure in SI units is kiloPascals

619
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:15,119
so what we would like to do is know the

620
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:19,410
absolute humidity expressed with units

621
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:23,369
of vapor pressure and that's why two

622
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:25,548
things on this I think we can see them

623
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:25,548
here

624
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:35,389
over here in addition to g/kg which is

625
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:37,759
intuitive is vapor pressure and that

626
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:40,368
goes from zero and this charts three and

627
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,630
a half four and this has units of

628
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:47,000
kiloPascals so a vapor pressure

629
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:50,930
difference would be the top number minus

630
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,119
the bottom number that's the amount of

631
00:37:50,929 --> 00:38:00,799
water in the air expressed as a vapor

632
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:04,220
pressure so with that we can take this

633
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,339
curve right here which is this same

634
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:09,679
curve only all it has on here is vapor

635
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:12,710
pressure and now this thing goes up to

636
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,838
50 degrees so you can you can calculate

637
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,659
it some very hot temperatures really

638
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:20,509
nonlinear here's the equation to get

639
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:24,009
this curve so we do this all in a

640
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:27,140
computer and here is a table of values

641
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:30,470
so we can do it by hand examples looking

642
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:32,480
stuff up here and we'll convert our

643
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:34,329
absolute humidity in grams per kilogram

644
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:42,980
to vapor pressure

645
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:45,380
so we get I'm gonna I'm gonna estimate

646
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,710
this well we don't even have to estimate

647
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:53,750
we can do it pretty fast twenty five

648
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:56,929
thirty right here I go across I'm

649
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,849
getting about one kilopascal

650
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:03,199
that's the vapor pressure in this room

651
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:08,180
now we go up here twenty five cross and

652
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:15,079
I get a three point one two three point

653
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:20,449
one 3.2 3.2 minus one so now converting

654
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:24,049
units we have three point two minus one

655
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:26,059
and now the units are kiloPascals

656
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:28,250
now I didn't teach this right in the

657
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:32,029
beginning because a vapor pressure is

658
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:34,969
not intuitive a weight per volume is

659
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:37,310
intuitive but this converts to Pascal's

660
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:38,849
and here's the beauty of this water

661
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:47,210
vapor pressure

662
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:47,210
our Delta H in our example is 2.2

663
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:58,349
kiloPascals now we would like to get a

664
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,069
dimensionless ratio that we can use at

665
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:03,199
all elevations and and all pressures

666
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:08,280
same thing

667
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:12,059
so we ratio the pressure of the water in

668
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:17,400
the air to the total air pressure we

669
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:25,409
divide it by the total total air

670
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:35,760
pressure and in our elevation our

671
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:37,529
average air pressure 2.2 / 86 kPa this

672
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,590
varies a little bit high pressure and

673
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:43,080
low pressure might go from 85 to 87 that

674
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:46,289
doesn't vary very much top amount Logan

675
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,440
I think it might be 60 kPa but varies a

676
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:50,849
lot with elevation but high and

677
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,510
low-pressure fronts don't change it very

678
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:56,369
much so this is somebody's gonna have to

679
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,010
do this math for me but it's what is it

680
00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:02,549
going to be maybe two point eight two

681
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:08,390
point two divided by 86 sorry zero point

682
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:08,390
zero there we go

683
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,369
point two five point oh two five six now

684
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:19,159
this doesn't have the unit's this is a

685
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:19,159
dimensionless racial kPa - kPa

686
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:26,220
that's the driving gradient for

687
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,049
photosynthesis regardless of elevation

688
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:33,239
because we've divided out by temperature

689
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:34,920
enough we got the same gradient there's

690
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,439
an important point for living at

691
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,420
elevation what if we took these

692
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,079
measurements and made them right out

693
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:48,869
there at the top of Mount Logan and we

694
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:53,750
got 2.2 kPa we did all our careful

695
00:41:48,869 --> 00:42:04,230
measurements and now we are at 60 kPa

696
00:41:53,750 --> 00:42:08,340
what's that come out to be which place

697
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:12,139
has faster transpiration rates here

698
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:17,269
everything's the same right here point

699
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:21,089
0.025 0.036 transpiration is going to be

700
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:23,909
significantly faster at the top of Mount

701
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:27,600
Logan than it is here in Logan for the

702
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:30,379
exact same conditions if we do this at

703
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:35,130
sea level it goes the other direction to

704
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:41,059
point to and now sea level is 101 kPa

705
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:43,650
average so this is by 0.02 - so

706
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,690
transpiration is less at sea level than

707
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,809
here and this makes sense because water

708
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:52,380
boils at lower temperatures as you get a

709
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:56,400
higher elevation and so transpiration

710
00:42:52,380 --> 00:43:00,829
goes faster at lower pressures - so this

711
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:06,119
is our dimensionless driving gradient

712
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:08,880
now the units for resistance are going

713
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,690
to be the same as the one over the units

714
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:16,740
for flux but when we express this now in

715
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:18,539
all the models we don't use resistance

716
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:24,239
anymore even though I teach it that way

717
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:26,900
because it's a nice ratio we use

718
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,899
conductance

719
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,740
which in electric terms it's just one

720
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,900
over the resistance so the equations you

721
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:41,629
see for driving gradient for

722
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:46,519
transpiration are transpiration equals

723
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:53,900
Delta H it is a dimensionless ratio

724
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:57,259
times G sub s the lowercase G stands for

725
00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:01,530
stir model conductance and the SSD model

726
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:04,110
so if this is dimensionless the units

727
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:08,280
for conductance are exactly the same as

728
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:11,690
the units for transpiration so this

729
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:15,060
might be grams per meter squared per

730
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:20,220
second and this is just dimensionless

731
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:25,380
times in this case grams per meter per

732
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:28,769
second a unit for conductance now we'll

733
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,329
talk about we're going to have to put a

734
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:33,509
I would talk about conductance in a

735
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:36,319
minute but the key here is calculating

736
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:41,790
this dimensionless number for

737
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:43,289
transpiration and I'll give you I can

738
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:45,659
give you a worked out hand out of this

739
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:48,420
but I have a handout of typical values

740
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:52,440
of these which helps because obviously

741
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,960
if this ratio goes up 10% and the store

742
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,420
mates don't change

743
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,690
transpiration goes up 10% and this we

744
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:04,559
can measure with instruments this is

745
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:07,170
real hard to measure and the but at

746
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,210
least we get this and we can start to

747
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:12,450
estimate transpiration because all it is

748
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:15,139
is two numbers multiplied together what

749
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:17,519
I have also before I leave this yes

750
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:19,559
here's the whole thing in saturation

751
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,280
vapor pressure and if you know this

752
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,960
curve and you know humidity and

753
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,600
temperature you don't have to do all

754
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,079
these lines this leads to equation to do

755
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,059
it in a computer in a spreadsheet and

756
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,340
our data loggers are pre-programmed to

757
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:38,219
do all this stuff in them based on the

758
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:40,318
in points because of these relations

759
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:42,920
but that's why we you can do it all from

760
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:51,259
that saturation vapor pressure curve I

761
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:51,259
have this table here

762
00:45:54,949 --> 00:46:03,469
of typical values bucks driving gradient

763
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:11,659
conduct on second line this up I hear

764
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:15,318
better a chai inside the leaf H a air

765
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:19,250
mister model conductance here's some

766
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:22,818
typical transpiration rates now turn

767
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:25,369
inspiration is determined not by the

768
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:29,389
weight of the water but by the number of

769
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:32,450
molecules so we go with moles of water

770
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:35,480
vapor rather than grams or milligrams

771
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:37,789
but these are typical rates for a

772
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,338
typical well watered leaf in three

773
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:44,779
different units and then arrange for

774
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:47,088
those units driving gradients we got two

775
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,859
and this here's typical and we

776
00:46:47,088 --> 00:46:55,849
calculated 0.025 six so there's our

777
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:57,739
typical gradient and there's a range if

778
00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:01,099
this was 0 it mean a hundred percent

779
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:03,318
humidity but they can get this gradient

780
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:06,680
can get enormous sometimes really hot

781
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:10,219
dry air and here's units typical units

782
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:13,460
first a model conductance on the on the

783
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:17,058
bottom so so far this whole thing is

784
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:19,130
great even if we can nail this number we

785
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:21,500
can't get transpiration until we have a

786
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,960
sense of this so you can do two things

787
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:28,210
you can put in some typical values for

788
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:31,699
this and calculate this which is okay

789
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:34,220
this by the way is all for a single leaf

790
00:47:31,699 --> 00:47:37,818
it's not for a community of Lisa's it's

791
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:40,879
exactly the same principles but it's a

792
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:42,558
the driving gradient is is the average

793
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,970
for all the leaves in the community

794
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,099
there might be at different temperatures

795
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:52,009
but we average those temperatures and

796
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:54,588
this GS is typically for a single leaf

797
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:57,079
but we can also calculate conductance

798
00:47:54,588 --> 00:48:01,009
for multiple layers of leaves - that's

799
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:04,390
the difference for a canopy this doesn't

800
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:04,390
change but what this one does

801
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:12,759
so let me say a bit about stamina

802
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:16,179
conductance this gets more a bit more

803
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:18,449
squishy and I need some room to show

804
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:18,449
this

805
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:33,670
put this right here here's our store

806
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,670
mates a couple of basic principles

807
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:46,279
here's G sub s first o mates so let's

808
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:51,589
put 0 here for closed completely closed

809
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:57,470
and if we're going off of typical

810
00:48:51,590 --> 00:49:02,030
numbers this can almost get to 1 and

811
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:08,029
when it's 1 the units are moles per

812
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:11,300
meter squared per second moles of water

813
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:13,850
vapor from the meter square per second

814
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,980
this unit does not have any physical

815
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:19,489
meaning it's just a number to make the

816
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:24,579
unit's cancel in this whole thing but

817
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:29,689
the driving gradient does and if this is

818
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:32,299
absolute humidity here what happens to

819
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:35,800
store mates so now we're going to go

820
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:40,810
from as long as you're going from zero

821
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:44,410
zero would be no air at all in the air

822
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:44,409
this this

823
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:54,690
and just put over here I'm just gonna

824
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:56,819
put dry humid and dry air that's that's

825
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:59,690
good enough for the principal mr. model

826
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:02,640
conductance what does this look like

827
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:05,220
well the driving gradient changes a lot

828
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:08,489
but to the snow makes change as it gets

829
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:13,829
more humid it turns out they do

830
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:17,609
and as air gets more dry Stowell mates

831
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:19,259
close now if I have zero here as

832
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:22,320
probably is about right i mean if it's

833
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,840
super dry still mates are not constant

834
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,970
this is why this is so complicated

835
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,160
because even if we get this driving

836
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:31,859
gradient right dang the store mates keep

837
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:37,589
changing because they're responding to

838
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:40,620
humidity after decades of research that

839
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:42,180
part of its by Keith Mont my colleague

840
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,059
at the University that's his whole

841
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:49,169
research is understanding what effects

842
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:53,039
these Stowe mates if it's dry air I'm

843
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:55,860
gonna erase my numbers here these

844
00:50:53,039 --> 00:51:00,509
soulmates dry up and they shrink and

845
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:03,240
they affect effectively get farther no

846
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:07,230
sorry the other way around if it's dry

847
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:09,989
air they protect the inside and they

848
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:12,750
start to close so that to keep this

849
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:14,579
humid in here this has to be humid so

850
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:17,849
the plant can grow otherwise it

851
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:23,279
desiccates and it dies so now the

852
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:26,369
humidity gets higher and they open up

853
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,220
more because there's not such a gradient

854
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:33,989
it's easier to keep this hold it we do

855
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:36,869
not understand exactly what these store

856
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:40,859
mates perceive in here but humidity is a

857
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:43,739
big deal and they open and close to keep

858
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:47,130
the leaf hydrated one of the classic

859
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:50,479
things you see is this is summer lots of

860
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:53,519
people are growing zucchini and squash

861
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:57,780
it's common to see a squash plant around

862
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:59,190
here in the middle of the day wilt if

863
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,240
you see them in your garden if you ever

864
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,000
done that

865
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:06,598
and he go dang it my squashes melted and

866
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,809
you watered again it still wilts that

867
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:13,230
process is called physiological drought

868
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:16,858
and it's means that the squash keeps its

869
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:19,079
toe mates so open the xylem can't keep

870
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:20,940
up can't get water to the leaves fast

871
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:24,299
enough and it wilt in the middle of the

872
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:27,269
day and when it wills that's it then

873
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:31,019
these clothes and then it gets some more

874
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:32,550
water and they open but squash it over

875
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:34,588
does it doesn't close its door mates

876
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,750
fast enough to stay hydrated and most

877
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:41,250
plants are very carefully regulating

878
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:44,338
this so there's a basic relationship

879
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:46,949
between humidity and this is really this

880
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:51,239
Delta this should really say driving

881
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:55,889
gradient here and stole mates stole

882
00:52:51,239 --> 00:53:00,419
mates close at night great it conserves

883
00:52:55,889 --> 00:53:02,460
water they need to get co2 in two Hut

884
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,599
for photosynthesis but there's no

885
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:11,190
photosynthesis at night they close so we

886
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:17,599
also know if we did let's see if I can

887
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:20,820
draw another if we also did co2

888
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:26,280
concentration on this same graph and

889
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:34,820
stomata conductance and now this is co2

890
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:41,940
inside the leaf as the co2 this is high

891
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:44,760
co2 and this is low co2 as the co2 gets

892
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:48,659
low the stove mates open to let more in

893
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:51,359
and if you give them more co2 they start

894
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:54,690
to close so we know this from when we

895
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:56,880
enrich plants with co2 they grow faster

896
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,858
and thus no mates close why would they

897
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,099
lose water they've got plenty of co2

898
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:06,199
they start to close their store mates so

899
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:06,200
co2 affects this as well

900
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,179
this mostly is determined by

901
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:13,769
photosynthesis if the photosynthesis

902
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:17,369
gets faster

903
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:19,199
because of that co2 then it drives it

904
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:21,719
over here and you've got to have open

905
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,449
store mates to get fast photosynthesis

906
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:28,230
it's like breathing to get the co2 in

907
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:30,239
and so thick at night photosynthesis

908
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:33,840
stops and they close their store mates

909
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:36,209
in the day the higher the Sun they're

910
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:40,110
trying to get to store mates open to get

911
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:42,809
more co2 so they can grow faster as long

912
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:46,559
as they can keep up with the water to

913
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:49,070
come into the top of the plant so in a

914
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,639
nutshell and I'm going to close here

915
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:56,880
this is why direct measurements of

916
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:59,309
transpiration are so difficult it's even

917
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,710
though we can get driving gradient we've

918
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:07,409
always got to be estimating this

919
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:09,269
resistance and these estimates are you

920
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:10,980
can make nice measurements in the lab

921
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:12,570
how do you measure resistance for strong

922
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,179
mates years ago we used to take

923
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:16,980
microscopes and look at the size of the

924
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:19,109
store mate so they're more open here

925
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,530
measure that one we don't do that

926
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,970
anymore

927
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:27,480
how do we do it now we measure this and

928
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:31,500
then we measure this and we calculate

929
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:34,320
that that's the remaining thing so we've

930
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:37,079
done this thousands of times rearrange

931
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,970
this equation to get resistance and then

932
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:41,130
we start to make drive principles like

933
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:43,619
this for what the store mates do and

934
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,329
after we get those principles what

935
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:47,009
environmental conditions affect the

936
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:49,500
store mates then we take them to the

937
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:54,090
field and try and predict whole canopies

938
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:56,250
from it but it's difficult to do the

939
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,260
beauty of it is driving gradients are

940
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,849
not difficult and we know they're

941
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,440
related to those and those we can

942
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:04,909
measure and calculate based on

943
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:14,230
psychometric principles

944
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:17,779
so any questions this is the end of the

945
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:26,420
transpiration part of this if I could

946
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:28,190
find an outline here I just blew through

947
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:33,440
this whole works right here in

948
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:35,289
transpiration tomorrow lecture 6 we'll

949
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,420
talk about conduction and convection

950
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:40,039
which is the same flux is driving

951
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:44,329
gradient over resistance that goes

952
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:47,570
pretty fast because it's the same

953
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:49,929
equation now we have we can really nail

954
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:53,539
this because guess what

955
00:56:49,929 --> 00:56:56,149
this the resistance here is not involved

956
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:59,000
biology it just involves wind blowing

957
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:01,400
and cooling things and those are

958
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,880
physical principles so here we can nail

959
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,099
heat transfer by conduction and

960
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,960
convection because there's no biology

961
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:11,989
squishy biology of the stoll mates

962
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,480
opening and closing so now we can get

963
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:19,219
this and then again by subtraction we

964
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:23,469
can get transpiration so we'll see it

965
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:23,469
tomorrow at 1 o'clock
