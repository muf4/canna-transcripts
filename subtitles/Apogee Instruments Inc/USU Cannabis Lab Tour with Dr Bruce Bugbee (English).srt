1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:09,839
I'm Bruce Bugbee, professor of crop physiology here at Utah State University. And in this

2
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:17,179
short video, we're gonna give you an overview of the medical hemp research we're doing in

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:24,949
the crop physiology laboratory here at Utah State University. We've had numerous questions

4
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:31,269
from many people: What kind of research do you do? How do you do the research? What are

5
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:37,170
you finding? And today I just want to show you some of the techniques that we use. I

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,649
think I’d like to start with this plaque right here. We were told when we started that

7
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:54,149
the university had a huge research program in hemp in the 1930s. So we went to the University

8
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,289
Library in Special Collections, and here's a picture of people from 1931 showing the

9
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:08,219
hemp in the fields. Back then they were growing it for rope and the fibers. And the work was,

10
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:16,079
grow hemp. The Navy needs the rope. Now we have synthetic fibers. The value for rope

11
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:23,200
is much less. We still grow it for textiles, and we still grow it for seed for eating.

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,240
But our research here is focused on botanical medicines. And medical hemp allows us to study

13
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,890
botanical medicines. When you think about it, we have a lot of people with many problems

14
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:45,611
with prescription drugs － opioids. Botanical medicines are far safer. We know that. We

15
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:51,990
just have to understand how their use is in pharmacology. We've had conversations with

16
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:58,929
the medical school at the University of Utah to study the pharmacological uses. And so

17
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:08,250
what we're doing here is optimizing yield and quality of the flower buds, which are

18
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:19,019
then extracted for CBD oil primarily. All of our work is low THC lines of cannabis,

19
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:26,349
but it's still cannabis sativa. So there's many people in Utah, there's eight or ten

20
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:34,488
growers, that have licenses to grow high THC cannabis. And we're working with them to optimize

21
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:41,150
their work as well. But I want to say our license here is just to grow hemp. But after

22
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,889
doing many studies, we know that we can extrapolate most things from hemp to marijuana because

23
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:58,030
it’s the same genus and species. So this is from a lecture from yesterday in crop physiology.

24
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:06,188
This is the laboratory, the teaching laboratory, where we work. And we wanted to start here

25
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:13,370
and then walk around the greenhouse and the growth chambers to give you a sense of how

26
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,759
we do this work. The types of studies that we do at a world-class laboratory for controlled

27
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:30,019
environment research. We have been funded in this laboratory for almost 40 years by

28
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:37,870
NASA. And all of the work for NASA has been to grow plants in closed environments for

29
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,718
feeding people in space. Whether it's a colony on the moon, our current project is a colony

30
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:50,900
on Mars, feeding people on the space station. We've worked with NASA to fly plants in space.

31
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,180
We bred a unique line of wheat called Apogee wheat for use in space. So we've had a long

32
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:07,319
close partnership with NASA. About four years ago, a consortium of large greenhouse growers

33
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:16,729
in North America came to me and the lab and said, “Could we fund you to study hemp?

34
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:23,090
We're growing it. We need to understand it. This is a complex crop.” At the time, we

35
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:29,839
had to tell them no you cannot fund us. It's not legal federally. About 15 months ago,

36
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:36,679
it became legal federally, and we immediately got the green light. We got licenses from

37
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:45,180
the state of Utah to study hemp. So we switched part of our research capability from studying

38
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,660
food crops in controlled environments for NASA to studying the quality of medical hemp

39
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,250
for use in pharmaceuticals. That's what we want to give you a sense of how we do the

40
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:07,180
research and where we publish the results. Let's go to the greenhouse and take a look.

41
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,060
Follow me. We'll walk out from the growth chamber to the greenhouse. Let's stop right

42
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:21,519
here. We recently got funded by NASA to make an improved system to grow plants on the space

43
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,490
station. And this is the press release from NASA, and this is a picture of the system

44
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,400
we're proposing. It looks pretty high-tech. It looks pretty complicated. But it is not

45
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:37,978
easy to water plants in space. It's easy to overwater them because the water doesn't drain

46
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,389
out of the pot. So we've had flooded plants in space. We've had drought stress plants

47
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:50,650
in space. Our new system is loaded with sensors to keep the light exactly right. Keep the

48
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:57,519
oxygen in the root zone exactly right. So we're excited to be working with NASA to make

49
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:05,620
a high-tech system for the space station. So now we go. This is the graduate room here.

50
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,759
Graduate students have offices. This is some of our recent publications. There's some pictures

51
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,389
of people that work in the lab. Here's a cosmonaut on the International Space Station holding

52
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:25,050
the wheat that we developed for space. They become real psychologically attached to the

53
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,280
wheat as you can see, and sometimes they don't want to harvest if. They want to keep looking

54
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:39,000
at it. Here's our work on medical and industrial hemp right here. And some of our recent publications.

55
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,750
Here's one on far-red photons and their photosynthetic value. Precision water stress. Plant breeding.

56
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:56,050
We do a lot of work on hydroponics in this lab, and a lot of work on photobiology. So

57
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:12,431
let's walk and talk. Keep coming with me. Now we're going out in the greenhouse. There's

58
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:19,158
multiple research scientists in here that do a lot of work, and they're all different

59
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:27,188
sections. This is one where we're studying types of media. Can we use sawdust in media

60
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:35,199
to reduce cost? This section is for our student organic farm. They're getting ready for spring

61
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:43,210
scale up. But the section that I want to show you is this one right here. You can see this

62
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:51,658
is a secure section. Here's our certificate to study medical hemp － medical and industrial

63
00:07:51,658 --> 00:08:06,870
hemp. This is where we keep our genetics. And these are all mother plants that are under

64
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:13,340
long days with high pressure sodium light to keep them vegetative. And we take cuttings

65
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:23,789
from these and propagate them over there. We're working right now with about 12 lines.

66
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:32,259
The growers around the nation send us their genetics, and say here to test my new line.

67
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:40,229
So we're continuously getting new lines of cannabis in here, and I should specifically

68
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:47,200
say medical hemp, to grow. That's why some of these are taller and shorter. We enrich

69
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,790
out here with high pressure sodium lights to keep them vigorously growing. So we're

70
00:08:53,789 --> 00:09:02,389
getting about 600 µmol of photons. This is an averaging bar for the light. This keeps

71
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:08,179
the plants growing vigorously all throughout the winter. So we monitor the light in here

72
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:18,429
carefully. This section is CO₂ enriched. So here's an aspirated shield in which we

73
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:24,979
carefully measure temperature and humidity. And this is a CO₂ sensor. And that's connected

74
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:37,509
over here. Now the fans just came on. This is our system for monitoring CO₂ in here.

75
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:43,039
So it's another thing we monitor and control for optimal growth. You can grow cannabis

76
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:53,500
without CO₂, but it grows better with it. Over here we're studying oxygen nanobubbles.

77
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:01,009
This is a special system. This happens to be made by the Moly A company. It puts microscopic

78
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:08,528
bubbles of oxygen in the water to improve aeration of the root zone. And we’re working

79
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:14,740
with them to optimize aeration. We're also working with them for plants on the space

80
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:23,740
station. So this is one of our mother plant greenhouses where it starts where we take

81
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:32,560
cuttings and grow uniformed plants that we move into the growth chambers. So now let's

82
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,179
move into the growth chamber room and take a look at

83
00:10:36,179 --> 00:11:00,198
what we're doing in there. So here's our growth chamber room... we have about 40 growth chambers

84
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:07,259
in this lab for testing various things. Some are big. Some are little. And we're remodeling

85
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:14,330
all the time to keep them updated for the research. Let's start over here. All of our

86
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:22,800
work is basically hydroponics because we make concentrated nutrient solutions and inject

87
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,759
them into the water. So what comes out is the plants are getting watered with nutrient

88
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:36,179
solution every time they’re watered. And it's all on drip irrigation. So let's take

89
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:52,029
a look at one of the chambers right now. You can look at the plants through the window.

90
00:11:52,029 --> 00:12:02,130
But for this video, we're going to open the door. Take a closer look at the plants. These

91
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:09,319
plants are, I'd have to look at the door, but they're about 21 days after what we call

92
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,459
the inductive photoperiod － short days. They’re all starting to flower. This is

93
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:24,958
part of a temperature study. So we want to optimize the temperature for these, but temperature

94
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,379
interacts with light. So we're forever in here measuring the light to make sure the

95
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:39,828
light’s exactly the same in all the chambers. The chamber comes with a light sensor in the

96
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:46,799
middle. This particular chamber... I have to look... this is at 29 degrees Celsius.

97
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:59,679
So this is one of our warmer treatments. But the plants are growing real well in here.

98
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:07,129
Everything we do is by Julian date. Starts with day one. Goes to day 365. To keep track

99
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:15,448
of all the studies starting and stopping at different times. So let's walk and look at

100
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:29,049
these. A second chamber. This one's 26 Celsius. 26 Celsius 79 Fahrenheit. This is intermediate.

101
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:36,609
The plants still look good. Now all of these are continuously monitored for temperature,

102
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,529
humidity, and light by a Campbell scientific datalogger hooked up to computer screens so

103
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:55,949
we can make sure that controls are working all the time. This chamber is at 23 Celsius.

104
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:02,830
And what you can see is it's a little on the cool side. It's not doing as well as those

105
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:10,569
chambers at warmer temperatures. It'll be okay, but 23 is a little on the cool side

106
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:21,469
for cannabis. So far. This has still got a ways to go till harvest. There's one other

107
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:34,350
study I'd like to show you. It's over here. These four chambers

108
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:42,430
are four different treatments. What we're studying in here is the effect of light pollution

109
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:48,750
on cannabis. We know it needs to be dark at night. But exactly how dark? We coined the

110
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:56,528
term reagent grade darkness to mean really dark. Is the full moon bright enough to trigger

111
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:03,600
anything? The answer to that is no. But how much light can they take? So let's take a

112
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,829
look. All four of these are the same. These are LEDs. And it's going to be real hard to

113
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:18,829
see, but right up in here is a little tiny red LED that gives them a tiny bit of red

114
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,100
light at night. And you can see some of the plants are flowering. It depends on how bright

115
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,250
the lights are. All of these chambers look the same. They just have different amounts

116
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:42,629
of red. So we're trying to zero in on how much light the plants can take. For these

117
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:50,539
studies, Apogee has developed a special sensor. We call it the nano mol sensor. It detects

118
00:15:50,539 --> 00:16:00,528
trace amounts of light. So we can extrapolate the results from here to all grower’s operations.

119
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:07,309
Cannabis is one of the most sensitive plants to light pollution. So far our data indicate

120
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:13,049
it's about the same as poinsettias. And they're quite a sensitive crop. But the data is not

121
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:18,549
all in. We do studies. We create different treatments. We do more studies. This is how

122
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:27,189
they work. Let me show you this. All the plants get drip irrigation with the nutrient solution.

123
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:33,579
And for this, it’s a pretty big container, to make sure they're not at all stressed in

124
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:41,549
the root zone. So this is our special medium. It’s a peat vermiculite media that we make

125
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:50,809
ourselves to get optimal plant growth. I think this is a good place to stop for this growth

126
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:56,899
chamber room. Now let's take a look at one other room where we're doing studies on light

127
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:07,720
quality. This is the laboratory right outside my office. And these are award plaques from

128
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,308
previous students over the years that when they've graduated we give them an honorary

129
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:18,338
degree in something unique. I've been doing this for coming up on 40 years. So we’ve

130
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:24,490
got a lot of students over the years. These are small chambers that we use. The size and

131
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:31,288
shape of the chamber on the space station. And we're in between studies right now here.

132
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:40,589
But here's where we create our own light and precisely study qualities on young plants.

133
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:49,049
What we really want to take a look at is this chamber right here. And you can see this one's

134
00:17:49,049 --> 00:18:06,820
pretty heavily instrumented. So in this chamber we're studying light quality. And you so can

135
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:14,678
see right from here we've got three types of lights. These are about two and a half

136
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:21,830
weeks from harvest. They're high pressure sodium lights, LEDs, different ratios of colors.

137
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:30,048
We can do five treatments at once. We take our Apogee spectroradiometer and characterize

138
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:37,740
the ratios of colors. Here's another side here. High-pressure sodium, which makes the

139
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,929
plants look orange or gold. And then LEDs in this one, which has a much better color

140
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:51,240
rendering index. This is one of the things we're finding is we can diagnose plants much

141
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:59,109
better under LEDs because the colors are more true. It's hard to tell subtle nutritional

142
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:10,649
effects under high-pressure sodium light. So now we're in the hallway to wrap up. We're

143
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:19,788
thrilled that we finally have funding to do some serious science on medical hemp and cannabis.

144
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:26,558
The universities of the world really have had limited ability to study this until the

145
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:33,288
last year or two. And in our case, we were able to transition part of our work with NASA

146
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:39,710
to immediately get a jumpstart on the studies with hemp. I think what we'll do is just walk

147
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,259
down the hallway here. But we have years and years of students that have done studies.

148
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,450
And I can show you a few posters. This is Curtis Adams who is now an assistant professor

149
00:19:51,450 --> 00:20:00,470
at Texas A&amp;M. He studied polymer coated, slow-release fertilizers. Polyon Nutricote and Osmocote

150
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:08,759
for his work. Nutricote’s the most expensive, but it was the highest quality that we tested.

151
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:14,109
Because of this work, which was funded by NASA, NASA switched from Osmocote to Nutricote

152
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:24,809
for studies in the space station. So walk down here. This poster is turning yellow because

153
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:32,319
it's so old. This is some of our early work with nutrient management in closed hydroponic

154
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:40,439
systems. Here's a picture of our wheat. And we have written several papers on this. Every

155
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,590
one of these posters turns into refereed journal articles. Here's high pressure sodium technology

156
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:54,980
advances with double-ended lamps. This is Jacob Nelson. He is now a PhD student at the

157
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:01,710
Max Planck Institute in Germany. He’s a terrific student highly recruited by them.

158
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:10,419
Did some nice work. This is lysimeters － weighing of plants to precisely measure transpiration

159
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:16,460
rates. Mark Van Iersel is now an assistant professor at the University of Georgia. And

160
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:24,298
Julie Chard was our research associate that did all this work. We can track transpiration

161
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:31,639
and stomatal conductance over time on these computerized lysimeters. We've done a lot

162
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:40,130
of work on chlorophyll, and it's led to some commercial meters. Chris Perry is now a research

163
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:48,720
scientist for Pioneer Seed Company. This was his work on measuring chlorophyll in leaves

164
00:21:48,720 --> 00:22:04,700
using optical meters. And that led to, well it led to the Apogee chlorophyll meter (MC-100).

165
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:11,640
Take one more minute to show you a few more posters. Paul Kusuma is a current PhD student,

166
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:20,450
and this poster showed our interest in light quality and plant growth. And you can see

167
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,870
the title. Because of this we coined this term: the

168
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:32,278
FAR-PAR index. And what that is is a ratio of far-red light to traditionally photosynthetic

169
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:39,839
light. And it's just a number from zero to one. And this work showed that our old approach

170
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:46,558
of measuring phytochrome photo equilibria was not as good at predicting stem elongation

171
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,980
as this new FAR-PAR index. Since we're here, this is phytochrome photo equilibria. It requires

172
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,549
a spectroradiometer. And you can see, depending on the background of light, these lights aren't

173
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:07,428
together. This is R-FR ratio. The lines still aren't together. This is the FAR-PAR index.

174
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:15,870
Look, the lines converge. So this is why we've gone to reporting this in our studies because

175
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:23,730
regardless of background colors of light we get consistent results from far-red. Another

176
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:32,778
paper by Jacob Nelson. We've done dozens of studies of light quality in this lab. This

177
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:37,519
went all the way back to fluorescent lights. This was some of the early

178
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:46,129
days of LEDs. Characterizing them. Here's vegetative propagation of cannabis. And when

179
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:52,470
we were working out procedures to get it to root quickly, all that work was done here

180
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:58,640
and presented at national conferences. Some cannabis in the field is grown from seed,

181
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,330
but the absolute highest quality is grown from rooted cuttings. And you want to be able

182
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:10,000
to get a hundred percent rooting from those cuttings. This is my colleague Larry Rupp

183
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,298
who has since retired. And Sabrina Sage who is an outstanding undergraduate student that

184
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:24,910
did this work. Here's a little bit of the work that we've done for NASA. Food production

185
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:32,308
on Mars. Ultra-violet and far-red. The ultraviolets here. The far-reds here. Both of them affect

186
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:41,519
plant growth, so we manipulate them in different ratios. We just got a paper accepted for publication

187
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:48,480
in the journal, Nature. Horticulture research on this topic right here. It's called “Current

188
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,980
and Potential Efficacy of LEDs.” So it peers into the future and analyzes how good can

189
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:03,528
LEDs get within the next five years. Here's another poster in the hallway. This one's

190
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:11,288
been up here a while. We've done a lot of breeding of super dwarf plants. Extremely

191
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:17,460
short because they work very well for NASA in the space station research. It turns out

192
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,350
they work well for lots of people around the world doing

193
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:28,009
research in controlled environments because they're so compact. Some of these we developed.

194
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:34,470
Some of them we got from breeders in other places. But they're so short that they are

195
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:42,179
not commercially available. So we maintain the seed stocks here for research scientists

196
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:48,940
and other places and provide seed for them. So we're back in the classroom to conclude.

197
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,710
And I want to make the point that we don't just study hemp in this lab. Even though we

198
00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:00,071
did look at hemp plants just now. But the NASA funding, none of that is for hemp. All

199
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:09,819
of that is for food crops, leafy greens, to provide fresh vegetables for astronauts. Tomatoes.

200
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:17,230
All kinds of fresh crops. Over the years we've studied a lot of agronomic crops, too. Particularly

201
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,440
wheat. So we're doing multiple things. And it really is because of sustained funding

202
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,558
for a long time. We've been able to attract some of the best talent from around the nation

203
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:36,028
in terms of graduate students because they're the lifeblood of this whole operation. The

204
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:42,839
work that they are doing is just terrific. I think something like eight of my former

205
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:50,759
students are now assistant professors at other universities. So it's been a great thing because

206
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,778
after they graduate and leave we continue to work with them. Thanks for listening. Talk

207
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,079
to you again in a future video.
