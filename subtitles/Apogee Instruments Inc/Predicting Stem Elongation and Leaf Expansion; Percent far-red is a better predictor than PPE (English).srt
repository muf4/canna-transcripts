1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,380
I’m Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments, and I want to talk today about our research

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:19,250
on far-red effects on plant growth and how we measure with instruments those effects

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,899
on plant growth.

4
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:27,219
So you can see from the title right here we get two approaches to this.

5
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:35,409
The percent far-red and a more complex measurement called phytochrome photo-equilibrium.

6
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:43,000
And I want to compare those two approaches to predicting stem length and leaf area in

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
plants.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,969
One’s the classic method.

9
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:47,378
More complex instrumentation.

10
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:55,468
One’s a new method that's much simpler and has the potential to be more intuitive and

11
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,000
more useful.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,439
The work I'm going to talk about has largely been done by my graduate student Paul Kusuma,

13
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,560
He's been in the trenches working on this.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,600
He and I work on this together every day to do the research and interpret the data.

15
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:22,339
So let's start with the definitions of these, and then I'll get into the data.

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:31,300
The first one “phytochrome photo-equilibrium” is the number of… a weighted number of far-red

17
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,879
photons divided by far-red and red photons.

18
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,629
It's a ratio.

19
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:47,709
And this ratio ranges from… sun is about 0.8… and as it goes into deep shade it goes

20
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,709
to 0.2.

21
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,759
So this goes down.

22
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,269
This number gets smaller as we get into shade.

23
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:58,319
How you measure these is complicated.

24
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,059
It requires a spectral radiometer.

25
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm going to show you exactly how to do that.

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:10,199
Apogee instruments spectral radiometers are pre-programmed to measure this and read out

27
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,409
in this number.

28
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:16,139
But you still need to purchase a spectroradiometer.

29
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,609
The new emerging option is just percent far-red.

30
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,780
Very simple.

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,280
The number of far-red photons divided by the number of total photons.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,818
And anytime you take a subset divided by the total, the total range of the numbers is 0

33
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:35,818
to 1.

34
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:41,810
If we had electric lights with absolutely no far-red, it would be a zero.

35
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,819
And many LEDs have no far-red.

36
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:53,209
This ratio goes a little bit… little complicated when there's no far-red at all.

37
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:59,830
Conversely in very deep shade, deep shade under a tree, this ratio could be almost all

38
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,209
far-red and it could approach 1.

39
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,348
So this is a real simple intuitive ratio.

40
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:10,789
Let's take a look at this.

41
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:14,378
To define this, we need to define the range.

42
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:24,889
So we use 700-760 nm for the far-red component and 400-760 nm for the total.

43
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,779
This is not quite quantum.

44
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:40,050
Quantum photosynthetic photons are 400-700 nm… let me write that on here… 400-700

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:46,469
nm is photosynthetically active radiation.

46
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:57,900
And so it's this plus 700-760 nm, and the sum of those goes to that number.

47
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,150
This is the percent far-red.

48
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,658
A few background slides are important here to say how did we come to use phytochrome

49
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:16,019
photo-equilibrium (PPE) and rely on it so much?

50
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,810
It started with this guy right here, Harry Smith.

51
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:29,490
In the 1960s and 70s and into the 80s he did pioneering work on the effects of colors of

52
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,560
light and especially deep shade on plant growth.

53
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
Here's the citation to his work.

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,840
Here's his results.

55
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,599
Here's phytochrome photo-equilibrium (PPE).

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:56,590
By the way this is also called phytochrome photo-stationary state (PSS) or (PPS).

57
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:00,099
There's a couple different acronyms; they all mean the same thing.

58
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,070
Just different acronyms.

59
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,599
Here's his results.

60
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,370
He grew plants in sun and shade, and look at how linear this line is.

61
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,949
A wonderful predictor of stem extension rate.

62
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,199
It's beautiful.

63
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,780
Building on this, we've used this now for many years to predict stem elongation and

64
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:31,429
leaf expansion, and it works beautifully as long as the background of light is broad spectrum

65
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,620
white light.

66
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,340
This works beautifully in sun and shade outside.

67
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:45,049
But when we move to LEDs with varying ratios of red and green and blue radiation, I will

68
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,819
show you the data, this breaks down.

69
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:57,099
And we have some good ideas of why it breaks down, but this is not as good a predictor

70
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,470
of plant shape.

71
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,100
Here is four people that have studied this ratio.

72
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,080
Now this let's take Butler 1964.

73
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,539
He was the first.

74
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,090
These are weighting factors.

75
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,418
Here's 400 nm.

76
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,659
Here's 700 nm.

77
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,960
And here's our ratio again right here.

78
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,620
Here's PFR right there.

79
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,120
So it sums up all these photons with a spectroradiometer, and it puts it in the numerator.

80
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,560
It also sums up phytochrome red and puts that.

81
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,418
Adds it together.

82
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:44,329
And the sum of those two is the denominator.

83
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,568
That's how this works.

84
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,259
It sums all the wavelengths, which is terrific.

85
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:55,079
But Butler was one of the first to do this.

86
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,169
And here's Butler's picture here.

87
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,800
1964.

88
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,180
This is well before computers.

89
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,759
So imagine the work he did is very pioneering to get these weighting factors.

90
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,080
Along comes Pratt and Briggs.

91
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,000
And here's a picture of Pratt right here.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,120
1982.

93
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,668
He contributed weighting factors to Garry Gardner who is at the University of Minnesota.

94
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:27,549
Is still working.

95
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,860
He made these weighting factors.

96
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,439
We'll come back to this, but these weighting factors are different than Butler's.

97
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:40,069
So we don't have universal agreements for weighting factors to get this.

98
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:48,240
Few years past, this is hot, Kelly and Lagarias, 1985, come up with a different set of weighting

99
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
factors.

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:57,300
And then finally, 1988, John Sager, here's a picture of John, yet a different set of

101
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,419
weighting factors.

102
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:04,759
All of these people had to use tissue with no chlorophyll.

103
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,930
This was usually oat seedlings grown in the dark.

104
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,189
So there was no chlorophyll in order to make these measurements.

105
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,509
But the waiting factors are slightly different.

106
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,339
Let's take a look.

107
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,989
Here's blue.

108
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,269
Gardner and Graceffo weighting factors.

109
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,089
Minimal weighting factors for blue light.

110
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:26,599
A little bit more for here.

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,460
And Kelly and Lagarias and Sager have slightly more.

112
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,329
Note that this doesn't get big until ultraviolet light.

113
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,450
This part right here, and this part right here.

114
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,719
These are UV photons.

115
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,629
People often say heavily influenced by blue, but a careful inspection really should say

116
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:54,620
heavily influenced by UV-A radiation.

117
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,200
So the blue responses are different.

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,700
Here's red.

119
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Far-red.

120
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,820
Far-red.

121
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,430
These are somewhat different in terms of how much they cut off.

122
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,859
These two are quite similar.

123
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:16,181
In the literature, in the horticultural literature, people cite Sager and use Sager’s weighting

124
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,181
factors.

125
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,230
And his papers are very clearly written.

126
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,139
He has nice tables of weighting factors.

127
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:29,429
In the plant physiology and often the ecology literature people cite Kelly and Lagarias’

128
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,429
weighting factors.

129
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,949
So there's not universal agreement on this.

130
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,759
You would think this is a horrible mess.

131
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,429
We have numbers all over the place.

132
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:44,259
It turns out these four curves are close enough the values don't differ that much, and as

133
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:50,129
long as you pick one and stick with it you can measure relative effects.

134
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:55,860
But this is the background, the complicated background, for how we came to have phytochrome

135
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,990
photo-equilibrium.

136
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,600
Here's the problem.

137
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,810
These were measured with no chlorophyll.

138
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:13,028
Phytochrome is inside the phytochrome molecules inside a leaf, and it is covered with chlorophyll.

139
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:16,519
All around it shaded by chlorophyll.

140
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,659
And we make these measurements above the plants.

141
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:25,500
And we're using that to predict inside the plants?

142
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:33,409
Even Harry Smith cautioned against using this for complicated light sources because of shading

143
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:36,829
by chlorophyll of the pigments.

144
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:44,180
Now I'm going to show you a slide made by Paul Kusuma that brilliantly explains this.

145
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,689
Here's a leaf.

146
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,160
Take this section.

147
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,549
You can see the cells in here.

148
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,019
Now let's blow this up.

149
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,070
Here's a single cell.

150
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,149
The nucleus.

151
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,950
This is the vacuole over here… the vacuole over here…

152
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:07,500
I got to turn my pen on there we go... nucleus.

153
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:15,899
In the cytoplasm are all of these phytochrome molecules, and they look like this.

154
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,470
If you can imagine a person when their arms are down it's inactive.

155
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,450
When their arms go up it's active.

156
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,160
So here's some active molecules.

157
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,740
When the light spectra changes, it hits these and they move up here to the nucleus and interact

158
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,870
with the nucleus and cause the photobiological effects that we see.

159
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,659
This is a wonderful story.

160
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:38,659
Beautiful.

161
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,019
We understand it.

162
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,899
Here's the problem.

163
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,360
Now we add chlorophyll, and more chlorophyll.

164
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,490
That's a lot of chlorophyll.

165
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,409
That phytochrome pigment is buried underneath a massive amount of chlorophyll, and we don't

166
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:57,639
fully understand the wavelengths that it sees.

167
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,539
We're working on this.

168
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:08,778
Paul's got some excellent ideas of how we're going to do this to predict what phytochrome

169
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,620
sees.

170
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,179
But it's still going to take a spectroradiometer.

171
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,399
Now you can pause this and study these.

172
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,570
This is a list for academic for good scholarship.

173
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,190
This is a list of the papers that I just talked about: Butler, Pratt, Gardner, Kelly, Sager.

174
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,540
These are citations where people have used PPE successfully.

175
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,839
But these papers only varied red and far-red.

176
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,339
They didn't vary green and blue.

177
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,279
Because of this… and I can pause this and write these down if you want to see them...

178
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:56,259
because of this Paul and I designed a study to test this hypothesis.

179
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,730
And here's what we did.

180
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,420
There were six growth chambers.

181
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,649
All matching.

182
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,909
Very carefully matched.

183
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,539
In this one we had a background of blue.

184
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:09,319
Now this is a cool white LED.

185
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,680
Very dominant in the blue.

186
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,179
And we added far-red to it.

187
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:20,289
So there's plus and minus far-red in this chamber.

188
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:21,610
To get high green.

189
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,629
There's not efficient green LEDs.

190
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:26,838
So we used a high-pressure sodium.

191
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:33,560
And we had plus and minus far-red with the green background.

192
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,099
And plus a minus far-red with the red background.

193
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,399
Here's the red in every case.

194
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,899
The reds were the same percentage in all these chambers.

195
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:50,080
So there's six treatments here.

196
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,170
Here's the plants.

197
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:58,879
Not surprisingly, we've now done this with multiple species, but the most reproducible

198
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,820
and the most sensitive is cucumbers.

199
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,180
Not surprisingly, when we add far-red it gets taller.

200
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,529
Here they are taller.

201
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:15,379
Now can we predict stem elongation in all of these treatments with phytochrome photo-equilibrium

202
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:16,379
measurements?

203
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,070
If that works, it will explain all of these treatments.

204
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,670
Let's take a look at the data.

205
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:28,559
Here's professor Smith's original graph.

206
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,829
Nice!

207
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,100
Whoa.

208
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,350
Here's the same phytochrome photo-equilibrium.

209
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,509
The data scatters.

210
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:41,208
The chamber with high blue, all of them sloped down, but they have big offsets.

211
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:47,549
And you can see from this data you can't predict, this is all stem elongation, you can't predict

212
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:54,539
stem elongation from PPE because it varies with the background-color.

213
00:14:54,539 --> 00:15:02,399
What if we took a simpler measurement and he only did percent far-red?

214
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
That original ratio in the first sector.

215
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,129
What does that look like?

216
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:08,939
Here it is.

217
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,250
Percent far-red.

218
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,070
Far-red photons divided by total.

219
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,070
Wow!

220
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,050
The lines converge.

221
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,870
They're not perfect.

222
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:25,919
But we've got a much better estimation of stem elongation than we did from the more

223
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,529
complicated phytochrome photo-equilibrium measurement.

224
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:38,328
We've now reproduced this with other species and shown this percent far-red does an impressive

225
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:45,328
job of predicting leaf area and stem elongation, and it's real intuitive.

226
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:49,370
And you tell anybody, the PPE went from 0.76 to 0.84.

227
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,528
And that's hard to know how much far-red was in there.

228
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:58,039
But you say it went from 1 to 10 percent, anyone can understand that.

229
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,719
It's a wonderfully intuitive ratio.

230
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,040
Great!

231
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:09,069
So now we're gonna have far-red sensors and quantum sensors and add them up in a computer.

232
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,199
That's more complicated.

233
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:19,088
Because of this Apogee has developed a sensor with two detectors: one for red… one for

234
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,459
a quantum sensor and one for far-red.

235
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,250
Here's the sensor.

236
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,970
There's two.

237
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,330
Let's talk about this one first.

238
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,839
This has two detectors inside.

239
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,480
In here.

240
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,120
One’s quantum.

241
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,679
So this one does PPFD.

242
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,649
The classic square wave PPFD that's in all Apogee sensors.

243
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:46,839
Sharp cutoffs at the edges.

244
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,330
In addition to this there's a far-red detector here.

245
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,220
So it separately measures the two colors and then adds them together in software.

246
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,240
So you get all combinations.

247
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,430
You get individuals.

248
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:00,689
You can do ratios.

249
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:11,250
But again from this sensor what we're after is far-red over PPFD plus far-red.

250
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,240
And that becomes a number between 0 and 1.

251
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:25,000
For 40 years, we have also measured red and far-red ratios because they're big peaks in

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,470
phytochrome in red light.

253
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,839
These sensors have been available for a long time.

254
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,959
They're widely used in the literature.

255
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,390
Apogee has also has a Red - Far-red sensor, and these two peaks look like this.

256
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,800
This is a beautiful sensor for reproducing studies in ecology.

257
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,918
Anything outside under sun it's great.

258
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:58,419
But when we start to move to LEDs with their varied backgrounds, we need to upgrade to

259
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:07,480
this sensor, which Apogee calls this the PAR-FAR sensor because of the par and the far.

260
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:16,769
So this is a simple explanation of why this ratio is so important, and it's wonderfully

261
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:19,539
simple.

262
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:29,109
And we plan to express our data as percent far-red in our studies to help explain these

263
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,759
effects on plant morphology...

264
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,779
And one more thing.

265
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:41,660
We get asked a lot about how these photobiological ratios apply to cannabis.

266
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:48,890
The good news is that my laboratory has a state license to study cannabis.

267
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:58,509
So we've applied these ratios to predict cannabis growth, and they have the same value in cannabis

268
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:02,259
as they do in all other crop plants.

269
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,500
Adding far-red is both good and bad.

270
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,200
And that's why the sensors are so important.

271
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,130
You want to add the right amount at the right time to get full advantage of it.

272
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,390
More far-red can make cannabis plants taller.

273
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,030
That’s usually bad.

274
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:21,460
But it also helps expand leaves.

275
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,470
That's good.

276
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,839
And there's evidence it can help with slightly earlier flowering, which is another benefit.

277
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,230
So this is emerging research.

278
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,809
The important point here is that you need to have a sensor to see what you have.

279
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:44,609
And if you have far-red you can use this sensor to dial it in and optimize it for the plants.

280
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:45,319
Thanks.
