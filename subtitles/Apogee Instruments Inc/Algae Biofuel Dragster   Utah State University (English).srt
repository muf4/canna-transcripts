1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,778
Could cars of the future really be powered by algae? Scientists at Utah

2
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:08,990
State University in Logan Utah seem to think so, and now they've exceeded a

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,900
world speed record to prove it.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,509
At the recent time trials at the world famous Bonneville Salt Flats, the USU

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,710
Aggies A-salt dragster shocked the crowd as a race down the track, powered

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,830
by a unique fuel synthesized from one of the world's most plentiful organisms,

7
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:30,778
algae.  To accomplish this took the melting of minds and the support of a world-class

8
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:38,640
institution, capable of forward thinking and long-term support. We combined cutting-edge

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,770
expertise in engineering with excellence in biochemistry and

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,559
agricultural scientists that were willing to think outside the box.

11
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,250
Tthese three elements converged perfectly at Utah State University, and the result

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,359
may just change the way we all get around in the future. The idea of using

13
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,280
algae as a fuel was born during the crippling oil shortages of the nineteen

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,269
seventies, faced with the reality of a world running out of gas

15
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,170
scientists began searching for alternatives. Algae was considered but

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,549
quickly dismissed because the science to grow and process it economically did not

17
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,040
yet exist. So, we're excited about the USU biofuels. We take carbon dixide and sunlight and

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,840
turn into

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,710
completely renewable fuels. We think it's a potential game changer because we can

20
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,509
actually use this in existing engines, and the test we've already done shown

21
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,078
that it works just as well as a renewable fuels like biodiesel.

22
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:42,919
Of the biofuels portfolio, microalgae has the best promise for achieving

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,920
significant contributions for transportation fuels. At Utah State

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,649
University we began building a research program that could be addressed

25
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:04,000
biofuels. We focused on how to grow it, hot to extract it, and how to process it. The A-salt

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,239
was recently clocked at 73.977 miles per hour, which may not seem like blistering

27
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,030
speed, but it beat the existing land speed record for its one liter small

28
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,560
diesel engine class. This is an engine size comparable to that of a riding lawn

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,840
mower. It isn't about the speed. The real story here is the fuel. Thescience behind it. The

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,430
research that goes into it, and the fact that we have a real replacement for

31
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,620
fossil fuels probably in our hands right now. Here at Utah State

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,000
we worked with the College of Agriculture, plant scientists, and they

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,859
understand how we grow these microalgae. To accumulate the high levels of

34
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:44,939
these biofuel precursor compounds, called lipids.

35
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,250
Biochemists focus on how do we take those cells, and how do we

36
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,879
process them, and refine them to get the

37
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,409
fuel itself. Then that can be used to do diesel engine tests and to be used in the Aggie A-salt

38
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:02,639
diesel stream liner. With the screaming success of the A-salt

39
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,439
dragster, they've proven the concept. The algae-based fuel works. Now, the next big

40
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,169
hurdle for the team is bringing down the cost of production.  Alagea don't

41
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:17,069
automatically produced the oil needed to make bio-diesel, stress is needed.

42
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,859
We're working on getting the stress right to increase oil productivity and

43
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,080
bring the costs down. Currently algae bio-diesel is about $15 per gallon.

44
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,190
We think we can bring that cost down significantly. We are really excited about

45
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:34,870
the enormous potential microalgae has to be a player in the biofuels area.

46
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,719
Coming from Colorado State to join the team here in the mechanical and aerospace

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,870
department, I take data from plates like these and open raceway ponds and other

48
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,289
processing technologies to perform systems level analysis. To be able to really focus

49
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:51,409
our efforts in research and development to drive the cost down. We're looking forward

50
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:57,699
to commercialization in the future.  We are currently studying algae production in both high input bio-reactor and low input

51
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,769
opened raceways. These laboratory scales raceways are powered

52
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,340
by state of the art LEDs,

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,120
which allow us to provide the equivalent of summer sunlight 365 days a year.

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,950
Growing algae in a greenhouse under electric light will never be

55
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:16,180
cost-effective, but it greatly accelerates our research progress. If their past

56
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,870
success is any indication of the future. We could all be driving algae fuel cars

57
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,780
very soon.
