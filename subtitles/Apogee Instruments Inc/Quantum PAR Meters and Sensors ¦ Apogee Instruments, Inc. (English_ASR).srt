some organisms like plants corals algae

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,000
and certain bacteria need light to live

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,079
but not just any type of light will do

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,759
most photosynthetic organisms require

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,518
light specifically from the spectral

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,118

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
reliable way to measure the

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
photosynthetically active radiation or

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
par that reaches any target from a

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,719
specific light source

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,159
monitoring par is critical to optimizing

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,839
correlated to plant growth

17

apogee instruments quantum sensors are

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,520
trusted for use all over the world in

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,199
many different applications such as

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,359
monitoring the output of electric lights

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
in growth chambers and greenhouses

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,878
oceanographers limnologists and

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,840
biologists use them to measure different

24
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,119
conditions affecting aquatic

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,120
productivity aquarists measure the par

26

00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
in artificial conditions

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,798
ecologists mount them on flux towers to

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,438
monitor factors affecting various

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,280
ecosystems and plant scientists use them

31
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,798
to measure par above and below plant

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,400
canopies when calculating transmissivity

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,320
