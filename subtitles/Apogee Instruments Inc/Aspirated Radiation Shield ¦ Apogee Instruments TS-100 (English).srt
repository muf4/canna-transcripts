In the past when measuring air temperature and humidity in remote

2
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,489
locations,

3
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:17,679
researchers have always had to sacrifice accuracy to conserve power, using

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,539
naturally aspirated radiation shields that can produce temperature errors up to 3 degrees Celsius.

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,369
To solve this problem

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,810
Apogee Instruments proudly introduces the TS-100 low-power aspirated radiation

7
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:33,939
shield. Representing a breakthrough in design and performance by yielding the

8
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:38,030
same consistent and accurate measurements as the best aspirated

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,999
shields on the market, while drawing only 80 milliamps and as low as 28 milliamps on

10
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:49,190
low power mode. How is this possible? It's all about the design. The internal

11
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:53,259
variable speed fan uses pulse width modulation and can be configured to

12
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,829
reduce power usage at certain weather conditions, while the shield body

13
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,308
features a coanda inlet and venturi contour, to enhance airflow, allowing

14
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:06,539
accurate measurements in both strong winds and still air. Finally, the shield

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,980
is manufactured in high precision injection molding process using geloy

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,640
plastic, which offers low thermal conductivity, maximum weather durability,

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,079
and a glossy white finish for high reflectivity. The TS-100 is compact,

18
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,629
lightweight, and rugged allowing for easy and extended deployment in the harshest of

19
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:30,729
climates. For measurements right out of the box, every sheild comes standard with

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,000
a precision thermistor, and is designed to accommodate PRTs and humidity

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,379
probes if desired. To learn more about the Apogee TS-100 aspirated radiation
