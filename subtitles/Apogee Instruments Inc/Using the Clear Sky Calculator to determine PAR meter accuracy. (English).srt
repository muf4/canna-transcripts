00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,000
Is your PAR meter no longer giving you  readings that you can trust?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,487
Are you seeing less than reliable results than when you  first set up your meter several months ago?

3
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:11,103
Before you replace your meter try these few steps.

4
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:14,051
First, make sure that your meter is clean.

5
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:19,230
Blocking the optical  path between the source and the sensor can cause low readings.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,432
Dust, dirt and other debris can be cleaned from the sensor.

7
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:25,442
Using a non-abrasive cloth or cotton swab

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,667
sprinkled with deionized water or window cleaner.

9
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:34,399
Calcium deposits from irrigation water can leave a thin white film on the surface  

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,149
that can be removed using a  diluted acid such as vinegar.

11
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,877
So make sure that you are cleaning your sensor regularly.

12
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:41,937
All right you cleaned your sensor,

13
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:44,896
but the measurements still  don't seem quite right.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,825
Let's find out what they should be.

15
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,000
The team at Apogee has created a tool

16
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:57,067
that allows you to see what PAR, ePAR, UV and shortwave radiation 

17
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,021
measurements should be

18
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,952
under ideal conditions. 

19
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:04,174
That way you can see just how far off  your meter is.

20
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,174
It's called the clear sky calculator.

21
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:09,304
This tool is found at  ClearSkycalculator.com

22
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:13,200
and it works with all power meters  not just Apogee meters.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,948
Ideally the measurements on your meter  should be taken as close to solar noon,

24
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,844
at summer solstice,  

25
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,367
in non-polluted Skies, minimal humidity

26
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,459
and the sensor perfectly level.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,588
Be aware this calculator will  give you an ideal number.

28
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,878
So if you have less  than ideal conditions,

29
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:32,478
be aware that your numbers  may be a little bit off.

30
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:35,750
This tool is not to be  used for calibration

31
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:40,501
Its purpose is to identify if meter readings  are drastically out of spec.

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,465
To use the calculator take a measurement from your meter

33
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:47,320
and enter that measurement  into the PPFD field.

34
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,914
Enter your ZIP code, country, date and time

35
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:52,211
and then hit calculate.

36
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:56,400
The calculator will show you how far off your meter is measuring.

37
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:59,703
If it's "off" by more than 10%  a button will appear

38
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,333
with a contact Apogee for recalibration button.

39
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:05,950
Keep in mind, it's a mathematical model with limitations.

40
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,400
But if you still feel that your  meter is out of spec  

41
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,219
then you can send it in for recalibration.

42
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,764
After recalibration you can get back  to confident data acquisition.

Unfortunately, over time all  PAR meters will begin to drift.

45
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,496
Don't worry, it's not your fault.

46
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:27,883
Factors such as age, usage,  and environmental conditions

47
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,935
can all affect the accuracy  of every PAR meter.

Being familiar with a sensor specifications, operation and measurements

50
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:42,516
will help you recognize errors  before days or weeks

51
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:45,453
worth of data become unreliable and unusable.

52
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:53,510
Apogee Instruments has built a reputation  of not just creating accurate PAR meters

53
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,080
but of PAR meters that stay accurate.

54
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,759
That's why we offer an  industry-leading 4-year warranty  

55
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,798
on all of our PAR products.

56
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:05,740
But at some point every part meter  is past its expected life.

Luckily, if the unfortunate does  occur,

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,843
Apogee will provide a discount  on a replacement meter.
