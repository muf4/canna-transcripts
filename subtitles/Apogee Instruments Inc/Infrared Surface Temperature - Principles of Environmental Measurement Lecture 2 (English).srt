1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,670
I'm gonna talk about surface temperature

2
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,010
measurements using infrared radiometers. If you have any questions while I'm talking

3
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,349
feel free to raise your hand and ask and

4
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll do my best to address it.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,340
I have lots of slides unlike Bruce so

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,829
we're going to shift technologies just a

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,530
little bit, but surface temperature can

8
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,450
be a very important variable in lots of

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,090
environmental applications. I'm going

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,520
to talk about it more in relation to

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,410
plants today but bear in mind that you

12
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,328
can use infrared technology to measure

13
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,509
soil surface temperatures, snow surface

14
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,670
temperatures, roadways if you're

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,500
interested in road conditions for

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,459
example. The three key components to an

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,589
infrared radiometer listed here you have

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,170
to have a radiation detecto,r you have to

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,570
have an internal temperature sensor, then

20
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,849
you have to have a housing to contain

21
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:18,298
the two and be rugged so that its stable

22
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,729
in changing environmental

23
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:28,728
conditions. So the basic operation is as follows,

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,579
we all know from from physics that all

25
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,010
objects that have a temperature above

26
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,359
absolute zero emit infrared radiation. So,

27
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,849
whatever you point the sensor at is

28
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:46,769
going to be emitting infrared radiation

29
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,479
towards the sensor in this case its a

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,909
plant canopy and the sensor itself has a

31
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,189
temperature above absolute zero so its also

32
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,399
going to be emitting radiation back out

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,190
so to speak, and the signal that's

34
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,539
actually measured by the radiation

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,470
detector inside the radiometer is

36
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,750
proportional on this difference between

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,639
the absorbed radiation that's coming

38
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,109
from the surface that you're pointing it at

39
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,390
and the emitted radiation from the

40
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,709
detector itself and those signals can be

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,570
quite small example of a common infrared

42
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,049
radiometer output 60 microvolt that's

43
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,380
0.06 millivolts per degree C

44
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,269
difference between the target that

45
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,189
you're looking at and the temperature of

46
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,949
the sensor itself. What this means is

47
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,919
if you're making an analog measurement

48
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,359
of this, you're measuring the voltage

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
directly, you need a high-resolution

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,630
voltmeter in order to measure that small

51
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,609
signal and to get an accurate number

52
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,959
so I've listed here about 1 micro volt is required.

53
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,020
You have to have a high-end datalogger or

54
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,070
voltmeter to do this.

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,359
In the absorbed radiation, the amount

56
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:09,180
of radiation coming in is less than the

57
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,519
amount of radiation going out then the

58
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,709
radiation balance at the detector itself

59
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,658
is negative and you'll get a negative

60
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,139
voltage so the opposite is true when you

61
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,809
have more radiation coming in then what's

62
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,150
going out the radiation balance at the

63
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,400
detector is positive and you'll get a

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,799
positive voltage rather than a negative

65
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,079
voltage, and so in addition to needing a

66
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,930
voltmeter that can measure small signals

67
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,180
in the micro volt range

68
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,769
you also need one that can measure

69
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,849
polarity both positive and negative

70
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:48,479
voltages. Right and so I mentioned a

71
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,590
minute ago that we all remember from

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,650
physics radiation and temperature are

73
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,349
closely linked. All objects with a

74
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:00,840
temperature above absolute zero emit

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,900
radiation, and the actual equation that

76
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,480
quantifies the relationship between the

77
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,369
two is called the Stefan Boltzmann

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,000
equation, where the the energy emitted by

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,340
an object in this

80
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,038
case its the plant canopy is equal to a

81
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,978
constant, that's the sigma times the

82
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,019
fourth power of the absolute temperature.

83
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,610
So if we're able to to measure the

84
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,470
radiation being emitted or the energy

85
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,050
being emitted by an object then we can

86
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,639
calculate the temperature, and that's the

87
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,769
basic premise for how these infrared

88
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:41,549
sensors work. Right so another important

89
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,740
component of infrared sensors that I

90
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,569
didn't actually list on the previous

91
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:48,449
slide is the filter that goes in

92
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,240
front of the radiation detector, and so

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,819
radiation detectors tend to be black

94
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,348
bodies, meaning they're good

95
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:57,149
absorbers of all the wavelengths of

96
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,668
radiation that are incident on them.

97
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:01,799
Remember we only want to measure the

98
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,270
wavelengths that are related to the

99
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,060
temperature of the surface. In order

100
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,300
to  build a radiometer that measures

101
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,038
what we're interested in

102
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,050
we have to put a filter in front of it

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,090
to give us just the wavelengths of

104
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:15,959
radiation that

105
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,288
we're interested in. So the radiation

106
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,060
detector should include a filter that

107
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,668
blocks all of the long-wave radiation

108
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:26,008
that's outside of what we call the

109
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,740
atmospheric window. The atmospheric

110
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,538
window is the wavelength between 8

111
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,089
and 14 micron, and I have a graph here

112
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,079
that shows wavelength on the x-axis from

113
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,050
5 to 20 micron and then transmittance

114
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,210
of the atmosphere on the y-axis.

115
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,709
The reason we choose 8 to 14

116
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,989
micron is that's the wavelength range

117
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,329
is called the atmospheric window and

118
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,329
it's essentially the the wavelengths where

119
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,370
the atmosphere is transparent to

120
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,788
long-wave radiation meaning if you point

121
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:03,360
a sensor with the filter that has 8

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,400
to 14 micron window on it

123
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,679
that radiation is going to come through

124
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,348
the atmosphere rather than be absorbed

125
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:14,158
by the molecules, water vapor

126
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:17,189
and CO2, in the atmosphere. So it's just

127
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:21,750
the wavelength where the sensor sees

128
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,168
through the atmosphere, so to speak.

129
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:29,098
Below 8 micron there's the lots of

130
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,519
absorption by water vapor molecules and

131
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,269
above 14 micron there's lots of

132
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,870
absorption by carbon dioxide molecules.

133
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,449
We want to try to measure the

134
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,639
surface radiation and not the

135
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
atmospheric radiation, therefore, we need

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,770
a filter that matches the atmospheric window.

137
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,909
Just to give you an idea of

138
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,319
calibration, I've got a couple quick

139
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,689
pictures right here. This shows the

140
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,019
calibration system that we use at Apogee

141
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,668
Instruments to calibrate infrared

142
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:06,579
radiometers and there's lots of these

143
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,139
things commercially available and we're

144
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,848
going to let you play around with some

145
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:12,370
of these handheld devices later you can

146
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,098
get models like this really cheaply at

147
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:17,918
the hardware store, and you point them at

148
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,228
the surface that you, you pull the

149
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,029
trigger and it gives you a temperature.

150
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,008
I just measured the temperature of the

151
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,500
floor as 71 Fahrenheit or if we

152
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,889
convert it to Celsius about 22 Celsius.

153
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,490
These are fine especially

154
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,620
for demonstration purposes or just

155
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,899
spot-checks where high accuracy isn't

156
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,939
required, but the main difference between

157
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,129
something like this that you can buy at

158
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,978
the hardware store for a few dollars and

159
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:48,158
something like this that we manufactured

160
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:49,779
at Apogee Instruments is really the

161
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,508
calibration. Something like this the

162
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:58,389
accuracy is probably 1-2 Celcius. Here

163
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm just showing the sensors, the

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,669
uncertainty of the the calibration is

165
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:08,978
about 0.2 Celsius. So there's an

166
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,689
order of magnitude difference between

167
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:13,209
the accuracy of something like this and

168
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:17,258
a research grade instrument, and what

169
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,900
you're looking at here is actually a

170
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,819
two-component system and it's kind of

171
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,918
hard to to see it but in the next slide

172
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,109
I think it will become clear. There's

173
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,270
this cap piece that fits on top of a

174
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:31,000
large piece of aluminum. The piece of

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,158
aluminum has a big hole in it shaped

176
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:35,468
like a cone and that's painted flat black.

177
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,520
We use that as the blackbody radiation

178
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,649
source that we can fine-tune the

179
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,229
temperatures and get specific values of

180
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,040
of temperature independent of the

181
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,439
sensor temperatures themselves. This

182
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,779
cap pieces another block of aluminum has

183
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,129
a bunch of holes in it that you can

184
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,470
slide the sensors into and then

185
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,920
independently control their temperature

186
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,490
what you have is a target or the

187
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,629
blackbody cone and a cap

188
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,919
that fit together, but we can

189
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,569
independently control the temperatures

190
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,050
of the two and set this temperature at

191
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,990
one value and the sensors at a different

192
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,629
value and derive a whole set of data

193
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:20,539
that allows us to get sensor specific

194
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,699
calibration coefficients for for all the

195
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,190
radiometers and we can fine tune it to

196
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,930
0.2 C uncertainty. Just to give you

197
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:32,179
an idea there's the actual calibration

198
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,629
device with the the cap piece pulled off

199
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:37,700
of it so you can see that it's a black

200
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,390
body. I have another one a small one that

201
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:44,149
will use for a really brief

202
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,269
demonstration later so this is

203
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,460
called a Leslie cube or if you look it

204
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,930
up on the internet sometimes it's called

205
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,269
professor Leslie's cube.

206
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,460
I don't know who professor Leslie is but

207
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,870
I'd like to meet him someday.

208
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,360
It's a really simple and powerful device

209
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,190
that will use in a few minutes to

210
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,820
illustrate the concept of emissivity but

211
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
essentially what you're looking at here

212
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,890
and what you're looking at here similar

213
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,750
devices that you can use to calibrate

214
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,970
the instruments.

215
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:20,629
Alright, so once you have a functional

216
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,549
sensor that's calibrated and you take it

217
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,339
to the field to make measurement it's

218
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,410
not just a simple matter of putting the

219
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,879
sensor out there recording the

220
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,259
temperature that it gives you and

221
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,539
accepting that as the the true value of

222
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:35,149
surface temperature. We actually have to

223
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,809
correct emissivity affects. Emissivity

224
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,000
is just a fraction of blackbody

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,789
emittance. Something like this

226
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,159
black body cone here the black-body cone

227
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,259
that I showed you on the previous slide,

228
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,779
they have very high emissivities well over

229
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,600
0.99, meaning they're almost black

230
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,080
bodies. A black-body is a a perfect

231
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,200
emitter meaning it emits all of the

232
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,440
theoretically possible radiation for its

233
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,690
temperature. Something that has an

234
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,030
emissivity less than one is often called

235
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,179
a gray body and it's basically it's not

236
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,239
a perfect emitter, meaning it emits some

237
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,149
fraction of radiation less than it

238
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,159
otherwise would if it were a black-body.

239
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,568
An emissivity is is how we quantify the

240
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:29,028
fraction of black-body emittance, so if

241
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:31,669
you have a surface with an emissivity of

242
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:34,519
one for example the only radiation

243
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,068
coming from the surface that arrives at

244
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:42,110
the sensor is radiation that was

245
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,839
emitted by the surface but if you have a

246
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,720
surface that is not a black-body for the emissivity is

247
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,009
less than one here will say 0.98, which is a pretty good estimate of

248
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:58,100
emissivity for a plant canopy. That means

249
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,829
most of the radiation incident on the

250
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:02,899
detector is coming from the surface of

251
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,208
interest but there's actually a small

252
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,179
fraction of radiation coming from the

253
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:10,250
background if it's outside the the

254
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,730
background is the sky. There willl be a small

255
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,188
fraction of radiation incident at the

256
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:20,240
surface that's coming from the sky. The reason

257
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,829
why is the long wave reflection at the

258
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:29,448
surface is 1 minus the emissivity, so

259
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:33,229
if our emissivity is 0.98 that means

260
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,019
our reflection of long way this

261
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,139
0.02. Essentially you have

262
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,870
98% of your radiation

263
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,669
is coming from the plants, which we're

264
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,009
trying to measure and 2% is

265
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,720
coming from the background or the sky

266
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,639
because being reflected off of the plant surface

267
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,269
sources towards the radiometer. You might

268
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:57,589
ask yourself why is that a big deal

269
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,790
well the plant temperature and sky

270
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:04,099
temperature might not be the same number,

271
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,290
if they are the same number if they're

272
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:07,789
close to the same number

273
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,919
it doesn't matter if you're reflecting a

274
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,169
small fraction of the sky radiation

275
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:14,990
towards the sensor it's similar to the

276
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,149
the plant canopy temperature, but if the

277
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,669
sky temperature significantly different

278
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,669
it can lead to errors.

279
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:28,099
We can correct for this effect with

280
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,920
a relatively simple equation and the

281
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,899
equations listed up here, I won't go

282
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,159
through the derivation, but the

283
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,129
information that you need to go into the

284
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,139
equation to correct for emissivity are

285
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,960
the actual measured temperature itself,

286
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,240
which we get from the sensor but then

287
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,430
you need some measurements or estimate

288
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,589
of the background temperature and then a

289
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,019
measurement or estimate of the surface

290
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,480
emissivity. You see once we have those

291
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,570
numbers they go in the equation here and

292
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,500
give us a estimate of the true surface

293
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,600
temperature. So just by way of example, on

294
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,420
a clear day the background temperature

295
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,279
and again if we're outdoors this is the

296
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,939
sky can be really cold in the

297
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,450
8 to 14 wavelength range that the

298
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,270
temperature sensor is measuring. We might

299
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,829
measure a surface temperature of the

300
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,940
plant canopy is 25 Celsius, a clear day

301
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,070
the sky temperatures negative 40 Celsius,

302
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:34,400
if our plant canopy emissivity is are actual surface temperature

303
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,730
0.98 is about a degree higher close to 26

304
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,159
Celsius than the measure temperature.

305
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,449
Emissivity can have a big impact on

306
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,770
temperature measurements and it's

307
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,409
important that we account for it if our

308
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,589
application requires accuracy better

309
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,750
than you know a degree Celsius or so.

310
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:59,360
Just to give you another example, on a

311
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,360
cloudy day with some again a measure

312
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,000
temperature of 25 Celsius, but on a

313
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,100
cloudy day the sky temperature isn't

314
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,110
nearly as cold as it is on a clear day,

315
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,289
15 Celsius is a much better estimate of

316
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,179
background temperature on a cloudy day.

317
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,549
Again assuming a plant canopy

318
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,769
temperature of 0.98, now the

319
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,480
surface temperature or the true surface

320
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,300
temperature is only about 0.2 Celsius

321
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,529
above what our sensor gave us. The

322
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,528
emissivity effect will vary with the sky conditions

323
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:34,928
clear sky is cold, cloudy skies warm

324
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:39,039
and when we get a break will actually walk outside

325
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,409
with some of these low-cost

326
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,990
handheld infrared sensors and you can

327
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,759
point them up and measure the

328
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,589
temperature of the sky and measure the

329
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:49,509
temperature of the surface and get a

330
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:51,989
feel for how big the differences are.

331
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:56,170
All right so this table just shows a

332
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:59,469
handful of emissivity values for

333
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,800
environmental surfaces and some man-made

334
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,169
surfaces, concrete and polished aluminum.

335
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:10,448
Fortunately most of the surfaces that

336
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,219
were interested in measuring things like

337
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,889
plant leaves and plant canopies, soil,

338
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:18,039
water they're close to black bodies not

339
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,599
quite because none of them have an

340
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,558
emissivity of 1. Deep plant canopies that

341
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:27,219
have a lot of leaves can be really close

342
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,920
to black bodies 0.99 in some cases.

343
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,669
The emissivity effect tends to be small

344
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,099
environmental applications but again it

345
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,959
can be quite important especially if we

346
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,989
have clear sky condition, and so this just

347
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,750
gives you an idea of background

348
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,120
temperature, clear sky will be very cold,

349
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,610
overcast sky will be near air

350
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,409
temperature, and this is a simple

351
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,719
equation that we derived in Logan, Utah that

352
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,139
you can use to estimate the

353
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,610
background temperature or the sky

354
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,100
temperature in the 8 to 14 micron range.

355
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,220
You take the the air temperature

356
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:10,149
and you add 50 times the fraction of clouds and then subtract 60.

357
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:13,119
The fraction of clouds is basically

358
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,538
what percentage of the the hemisphere of

359
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:22,419
sky is cloud cover and what percentage is clear.

360
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,559
Let's take a quick break, I'm

361
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,798
about maybe halfway through and we have

362
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,819
a break for tea time in just a few minutes.

363
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,960
I'm going to ask if James would go fill

364
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,298
our little Leslie cube full of hot water

365
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:44,888
and just show you the emissivity effect

366
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:49,178
in real time. Yeah, just hot water,

367
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:51,249
just put it in right there

368
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:53,919
fill it all the way. All we're

369
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,749
going to do is I have a a couple

370
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,868
infrared sensors here and when we take a

371
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,608
break your welcome to play around with

372
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:05,048
these so it's really simple power button

373
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:07,418
and then you point it at what you want to

374
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,730
measure and it outputs the

375
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,099
temperature on the screen in Celsius,

376
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:14,138
for example if I point it at the

377
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:18,579
ceiling and we get around 22 Celsius, I

378
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:21,158
point I at the floor we get about the

379
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,889
same number and that makes sense the

380
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:25,959
room here is essentially the same

381
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,730
temperature and so the surfaces in the

382
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,108
room should be about the same

383
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,658
temperature. All we're going to do is

384
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,929
measure the black-body surface of the

385
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,720
Leslie cube and then the side of the

386
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,528
Leslie cube and so take a look at these

387
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:46,058
numbers for a second and I can tell you

388
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,970
the side of the Leslie cube its polished

389
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,089
stainless steel so polished aluminum has

390
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,658
an emissivity of around point 0.3-0.5,

391
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:58,299
polished stainless steel will be

392
00:18:58,298 --> 00:18:59,798
something similar, I don't know the

393
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,628
exact number but it will be something

394
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,759
similar. Now what we're going to do is

395
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,308
fill the the Leslie cube full of hot

396
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:09,579
water, right, and we know that the

397
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,099
blackbody cone of the Leslie cube is

398
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,798
close to a blackbody so it's emissivity

399
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,960
is very near one.

400
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,079
Any ideas what the temperature of the

401
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,808
black-body cone will be versus the

402
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:26,019
stainless steel side of the Leslie cube,

403
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,519
if we measure it with one of these

404
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,269
sensors. Let's just assume the water

405
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,410
temperature will be 50 or 60 Celsius.

406
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,560
What should be the black-body cone

407
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:47,250
surface temperature be?  It should be

408
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,500
close to the true temperature because

409
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,440
it's a black-body meaning it's it's even

410
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,660
emitting the maximum amount of radiation

411
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,810
it should emit for that temperature.

412
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,629
What about a if we point it at the side

413
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,930
of the Leslie cube and measures the

414
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,150
polished aluminum surface,

415
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,769
what should the temperature be?

416
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:17,279
Yeah 22 C, we should see a temperature

417
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,750
that's pretty close to the room

418
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,380
temperature, because remember 1 minus the emissivity

419
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,870
is the long-wave reflectivity

420
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,299
and so let's just assume that the

421
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,450
emissivity of this flat side is 0.05.

422
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,180
That means 95% of the radiation that were measuring

423
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,519
should be reflected from the room. We should see

424
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,639
something that may be about 22 Celsius

425
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,830
because the ceiling and the floor were

426
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:47,069
about 22 when we measure them. I'll

427
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:49,829
turn it on and I don't know how well you

428
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:51,299
can see the screen all yell out the

429
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,069
numbers for those of you can't see the

430
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:53,569
screen.

431
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,980
If we pointed at the the black-body surface,

432
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,559
and the unit actually does some averaging,

433
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,609
and so it's up to temperature now looks like it's about

434
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,689
38.6 Celsius.

435
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:12,029
Now if I pointed at the panel on the side,

436
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:17,309
we're getting about 26 Celsius. Not quite as

437
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,859
cold as the the 22 that I measured on

438
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,309
the floor and that might be because the

439
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:24,960
emissivity is actually a little bit

440
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,079
higher maybe the emissivity is like 0.1 or 0.2.

441
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,929
What were actually doing is getting an

442
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,940
average temperature somewhere between

443
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,190
the true temperature and the room

444
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,529
temperature because the emissivity is

445
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,329
somewhere between 0 and , and I

446
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:42,129
don't know exactly what it is.

447
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,290
Oh increase the distance, sure.

448
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:53,109
This is an excellent question because

449
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,149
you're actually jumping ahead in my

450
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,620
slides the next thing I'm going to talk

451
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,599
about in my slideshow is the field of

452
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,329
view, and so what happens if we put it

453
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:05,619
right up next to the blackbody we should

454
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,809
measure something around 38 and again we

455
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:12,789
are about 38.4. If I slowly start to move

456
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,329
it away, in the front row what's

457
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:18,779
happening?

458
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,480
It's getting colder and colder. Now

459
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,809
we're about probably 12 centimeters,

460
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,909
maybe 14 centimeters away, and we're

461
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,259
reading 30 instead of 38.

462
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:33,250
What's happening is we're moving it further and further from

463
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,329
the black-body, we're seeing more and

464
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,899
more within the footprint that this

465
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,120
thing measures. Now we're starting

466
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,399
to move it away and we're seeing the

467
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,250
sides or its polished aluminum in

468
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,470
addition to the black-body and that's

469
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,600
determined by the the field of view of

470
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,649
the sensor. I might actually be

471
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,810
able to do another demonstration let me see

472
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,393
if I have a light in my bag.

473
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,700
Bruce: Mark let me make a comment

474
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,778
while you're getting set up for that.

475
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:10,329
If you look on the internet, for

476
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:13,569
manufacturers of infrared radiometers

477
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:15,519
you will see some manufacturers that

478
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,608
sell an instrument with a dial on the back,

479
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:22,478
that is allegedly correct for emissivity.

480
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:25,330
They say this is a terrific feature,

481
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:27,308
our instruments are more accurate

482
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:30,249
because it dialed in emissivity, what they

483
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:34,089
do is take the reading and multiply it by the emissivity.

484
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:37,919
Mark: Actually, they divide by the emissivity.

485
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,389
Bruce: Yes, they divide. But, it often makes

486
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,848
the measurement worse instead of better

487
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,398
because they're not including

488
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:47,319
the reflected radiation that Mark's

489
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,428
talking about.

490
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:51,700
That confuses a lot of people.

491
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,580
They act like a simple dial you can just

492
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:58,989
correct for this and it drives

493
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:00,190
people that know what they're doing

494
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,429
crazy because it confuses the issue.

495
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:06,640
You can't just take a dial and correct for emissivity.

496
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,020
Mark: Good point Bruce.

497
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:12,970
If you have infrared radiometers that

498
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,009
have a dial on them and allow you to

499
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:17,049
tune it to the emissivity of the surface,

500
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:20,200
I would strongly recommend that you set

501
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,259
that dial to 1 so that it doesn't make that

502
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,599
correction, actually it will make the

503
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,549
correction will take the measurement and it will divide it by

504
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,430
1 so you get the actual measurement and

505
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,799
then use the equation that I gave you on

506
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,289
the previous slide makes the emissivity

507
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:39,009
corrections the right way.

508
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:45,059
If there's no more questions about emissivity...

509
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:49,750
Question: We've got real problems with emissivity down south in Anartica because our moss temperatures in

510
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,000
full Sun and it can get up to 20 degrees

511
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,099
Celsius and the air temperature is obviously much colder than that.

512
00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:02,319
If we use infrared sensors down there, we are finding a lot of degree accuracy and

513
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,659
also the mosses, the emissivity can change according to

514
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,710
if they are dry, underwater, frozen, whatever. Is there any quick solution for

515
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,160
correcting for emissivity if the emissivity is changing over time.

516
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,560
Mark: I think the answer to that is you have to

517
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,929
actually characterize the emissivity.

518
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,500
You need to know what it is with within

519
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,299
whatever degrees of uncertainty you're

520
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:30,369
comfortable with in order to use the

521
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,009
equation that I've shown here.

522
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,869
There are ways to measure the emissivity

523
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:37,329
and if you want I can give you some

524
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:42,470
direction regarding the papers and literature that will

525
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,480
describe how to measure emissivity.

526
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,990
But yeah, in order to use the equation to

527
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,490
correct for emissivity you have to have a

528
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,960
pretty good handle on it, you need to know what it is.

529
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,659
Bruce:  You can get close by

530
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,450
looking it up, because you look at water

531
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,288
0.96-0.98, biological surfaces are

532
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:08,710
full of water and so there always in

533
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,190
0.96 to 0.98, like our skin is a

534
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,440
high emissivity because its hydrated, its full of water.

535
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,890
Sometimes it matters if its 0.96 or 0.98, but biological surfaces

536
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,090
that are full of water are always high emissivity

537
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,899
but still you can have significant errors if you don't do anything about it.

538
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,290
Question: I think it is because the moss temperature is

539
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,849
so different from the air temperature,

540
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:39,849
even a slight difference in emissivity

541
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,579
could drastically alter your measurements.

542
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:47,289
Mark: There's no doubt my examples only showed,

543
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:50,470
I had an example for a clear sky and a

544
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,269
cloudy sky but I could just as easily

545
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,879
have an example for clear sky with an

546
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,250
emissivity of 0.98 and clear sky

547
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,220
with an emissivity 0.95 and we could

548
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,719
look at the error there.

549
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:05,650
There will be an error as a function of emissivity

550
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,050
and so if you don't know the exact

551
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:09,430
emissivity you either have to live with that

552
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,380
uncertainty or you have to measure the

553
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,539
emissivity so you know it is.

554
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:16,480
Any other questions?

555
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,190
Let's talk about field-of-view for a second.

556
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:27,279
The actual area or the footprint that's being measured by the

557
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,769
radiometer will depend on three things

558
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:32,710
one of them is the field-of-view of the

559
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,680
radiometer, one of them is the mounting

560
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,570
height or the distance of the radiometer

561
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,279
from the surface that you're trying to

562
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,589
measure, and the other one is the angle

563
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,929
of the radiometer whether it's looking

564
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,039
straight down or at an angle.

565
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,789
The field-of-view of the radiometer is

566
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:54,159
defined as the angle or the half angle

567
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,840
of the cone apex where the cone base is

568
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,879
the area surface being measured in the

569
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,230
apex is right here. Just to illustrate

570
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,259
this particular model has a half-angle

571
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,140
field-of-view of 22 degrees or a full

572
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,590
angle field-of-view of 44 degrees, but

573
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:16,509
the best way that I like to think of

574
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:17,980
field-of-view and the best way that I

575
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,480
like to illustrate it is with a

576
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,390
flashlight. This is not necessarily a

577
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,790
flashlight it's just a pen with LED on

578
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,259
the end but I think I can make it work

579
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:28,319
for demonstration purposes.

580
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,960
We're all familiar if we go into a dark room

581
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,140
and we hold the flashlight close to the

582
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,350
wall and perpendicular to the wall we

583
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,199
get a small circle where it's pretty

584
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,420
high intensity light right

585
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,690
then if we start moving the flashlight

586
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,320
away from the wall the circle it gets bigger; it spreads out.

587
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,659
If we hold the flashlight back to

588
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,670
the wall and then we start to angle it's

589
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,640
no longer perpendicular to the wall, the

590
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,290
footprint or the spot on the wall it

591
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:08,230
now spreads out into an ellipse rather

592
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,079
than a circle and so the the field of

593
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,929
view of a radiometer is analogous to the

594
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,750
the spot or the light dot that a

595
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,752
flashlight makes on a wall.

596
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:22,269
If you're radiometer is perpendicular to the

597
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,440
surface that you're trying to measure,

598
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,620
its going to have a footprint of a

599
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:29,859
circle. If you're pretty close to the

600
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:31,119
surface you're trying to measure, that

601
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,459
footprint is going to be small. If you

602
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,860
move the radiometer further from the

603
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,529
surface, the footprint gets bigger and

604
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,809
bigger meaning you're averaging more and

605
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,839
more of the ground area into the

606
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,879
temperature measurement.

607
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,170
Just like when we moved the flashlight away from the

608
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,210
wall, not only does the circle get

609
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,750
bigger but it got less and less intense.

610
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,990
If you're radiometer is

611
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,000
perpendicular to the surface, you see a

612
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,829
circle as soon as you start to angle it

613
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:06,460
the footprint spreads out into an ellipse.

614
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,650
Here are the different field-of-view

615
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,980
options of infrared sensors that Apogee

616
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,259
builds and other companies that make

617
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:19,089
infrared radiometers are likely to have

618
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:22,179
different fields-of-view. There's three

619
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,259
of them that have a circular

620
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:25,569
field-of-view, just different angles that

621
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:28,210
make the footprint either a little bit

622
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,490
smaller or a little bit larger and then

623
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,349
this one has a horizontal field-of-view;

624
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:35,259
this one is actually designed to look at

625
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:38,980
row crops. The field-of-view is wide

626
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,559
in this dimension but narrow in this

627
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:45,159
dimension, so if you orient it

628
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,460
horizontally like this with row crops

629
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,100
looking that are running this way then

630
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,619
you can try to minimize the soil that is

631
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,669
in the field-of-view and maximize the plant

632
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,110
area that is in the field-of-view using a

633
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,689
horizontal field-of-view. What

634
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,970
often comes up is that's all well and

635
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,009
good I understand that putting it close

636
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:08,660
to the surface gives me a small

637
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,100
footprint and moving away from the

638
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,469
surface gives me a big footprint, but how

639
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,049
do I actually attach numbers to the

640
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:17,720
footprint? There is a tool that you can

641
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,480
find on the Apogee Instruments web page

642
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,110
that allows you to calculate in

643
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:27,500
dimensions of meter squared, how much

644
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,920
land area am I going to see if I have a

645
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,100
sensor with this field-of-view, for

646
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:37,250
example; this height above the surface,

647
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,859
and this angle from

648
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:42,229
perpendicular. We have two know three

649
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,099
numbers in order to to get a footprint

650
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:48,709
calculation. You have to know the

651
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,680
field-of-view of the radiometer, the

652
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,539
height above the surface that you've

653
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:55,819
mounted your radiometer, and then the

654
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,859
angle of the radiometer from

655
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,719
perpendicular.

656
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,430
Once you input those three numbers into

657
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,400
the calculator it will spit out meter

658
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,990
squared of ground area that

659
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,339
you're going to actually measure on the

660
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:11,269
ground. Another question that comes up

661
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,700
often in relation to field-of-view is,

662
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,000
what do I do in this situation where I

663
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,700
have partial canopy cover? Maybe it is

664
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,460
row crops or maybe it's a forest where the

665
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,640
trees are fairly sparse and you're

666
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,350
trying to measure the plant canopy

667
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,329
temperature but you have all of this

668
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:34,309
soil that you see in the background.

669
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:36,200
A couple techniques and I won't spend too

670
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,360
much time on these, one way that you can

671
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,639
deal with this is angle the radiometer

672
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,190
to try to maximize the canopy within the

673
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,009
field-of-view so you can see if it's

674
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:47,299
looking straight down you're going to

675
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,879
see something like you know half of the

676
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,210
area within the footprint is soil and

677
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,960
the other half is plants, but now if you

678
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,480
angle it, most of what you see is in the

679
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,490
in the area is plants you might still

680
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,769
have a little sliver of soil here that

681
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:05,929
you see, but

682
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,360
by angling it you can try to get more

683
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,548
plant area and less soil area in the

684
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:13,730
footprint. Another way that you can

685
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,470
deal with this as you can measure or

686
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,200
estimate the soil temperature and then

687
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,470
approximate the fractions of canopy and

688
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,350
fraction of soil that are within the

689
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:28,158
field-of-view and you can use a simple

690
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,179
equation to try to estimate the canopy

691
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,360
temperature if you know roughly what the

692
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,939
fraction of canopy is, the fraction

693
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,278
of soil is, and the soil temperature.

694
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:44,659
The input you need here are this

695
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,850
is the actual measured surface

696
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:49,969
temperature from the sensor, this would

697
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,950
be a measurement or estimate of the soil

698
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,610
temperature, this one is the fraction of

699
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:58,490
canopy in the field-of-view, and one minus

700
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,319
that number is the fraction of soil

701
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,329
within the field-of-view. So if you have

702
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:04,730
reasonable estimates of soil temperature

703
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,649
and then the fraction of field-of-view

704
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:09,769
that's occupied by canopy and soil, you can

705
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:13,309
try to estimate canopy temperature from

706
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:15,679
the data and eliminate the soil

707
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,690
temperature,if canopy temperature is

708
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,068
the number that you're you're looking

709
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:25,699
for. I have a few more slides that deal

710
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,128
with an application of infrared

711
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:31,429
measurements of surface temperature or

712
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:35,340
we can take time for tea.

713
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,539
You want to see the application, it won't take too much time?

714
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:42,489
Okay, I'll try to be brief.

715
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,108
Just a real quick summary of

716
00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:49,029
infrared thermometery or infrared

717
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,510
radiometry, small signals require a

718
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,659
higher resolution voltmeter. That's if

719
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,269
you have an analog sensor nowadays a lot

720
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:00,670
of sensors have analog-to-digital

721
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,490
converters onboard the sensor and then

722
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:05,559
they output digital signals like SDI-12

723
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:09,578
or modbus and so ifyou want to

724
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,079
make surface temperature measurements

725
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,310
but you don't have a way to measure

726
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:15,159
these small voltages that doesn't mean

727
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:17,049
you can't make the measurement it just

728
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,519
means you need to buy a version that

729
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,159
outputs a digital signal like modbus or

730
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,309
SDI-12. Emissivity correction is required,

731
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:26,559
we spent quite a bit of time on that one.

732
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,690
Remember the radiometer averages

733
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,210
everything within the field-of-view, so

734
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,710
if you have things within the field-of-view

735
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,108
that you don't want to see you either

736
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:37,119
have to reposition the sensor to

737
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,550
eliminate them from the field-of-view or

738
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,619
if it's the case of plant canopies and

739
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,059
soil there's ways you can try to

740
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,449
estimate one temperature if you know the

741
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:50,469
other. We're going to move on to the

742
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:53,139
application really quick. In the past

743
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,000
we've often made the model conductance

744
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,818
measurement with these little handheld

745
00:35:57,818 --> 00:35:59,619
devices or sometimes they're not little.

746
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,869
This is a full photosynthesis

747
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,079
system from Licor, some

748
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,150
of you may be familiar with this. This is

749
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,430
a pourameter from Decagon they

750
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:12,759
allow you to the clamp on to leave and

751
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,160
measure stomatal conductance and these

752
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,559
are great instruments but all you get is

753
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:20,049
the stomatal conductance of a single leaf

754
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,450
that you clamped on. It also

755
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,098
requires a person to be in the field

756
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,480
with the instrument to make the

757
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,349
measurement. So a few years ago myself

758
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:31,930
and Bruce in one of our colleagues set

759
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:35,500
out to use infrared radiometers to try

760
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,199
to measure plant canopy stomatal

761
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,568
conductance automatically. Basically

762
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:45,190
using weather data and with the addition

763
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,409
of an infrared measurement of the canopy

764
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:50,529
temperature to estimate stomatal conductance.

765
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,530
I won't spend too much time here but

766
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,990
you're looking at a picture of the

767
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:59,019
surface energy balance so the

768
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,929
equations over here are all the

769
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,389
equations necessary to describe the

770
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,519
surface energy balance and the number

771
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,170
that were interested in here is the

772
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,840
plant canopy stomatal conductance.

773
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,620
Without going into detail, we can

774
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:17,650
rearrange all over the equations that

775
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,340
are shown here for the the surface and

776
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,180
we can solve for for this number.

777
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:28,179
Everything is described in the paper on

778
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,859
this slide and if you're interested in

779
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,110
the paper i can easily send you a PDF of

780
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,920
it. When we do that it gives us an

781
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,309
equation that that calculates plant

782
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:41,199
canopy stomatal conductance if we

783
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,230
have these measurements or estimates and

784
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,519
so we have to have the canopy

785
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,039
temperature, air temperature, humidity

786
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,360
radiation, wind speed, and then some

787
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,039
information about the height of the

788
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,449
plants and the leaf area index.

789
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:01,000
In the previous slide I was showing a

790
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,309
picture of one of our weather stations

791
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:04,779
and so here's where we're getting all of

792
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,630
our weather data and all of these

793
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,280
things that you see here are the

794
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,290
infrared radiometer and these ones are

795
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,110
looking at a corn canopy. This was in

796
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,990
Nebraska I believe. I'll just show you

797
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:20,500
some data we actually calculated

798
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,190
stomatal conductance from the measurements

799
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,119
that we made.

800
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,250
What you're looking at here is

801
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,280
canopy stomatal conductance on the

802
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,670
y-axis and then x axis says day of year.

803
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,570
This is day of year 195 through day of

804
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,180
year 206 those would be roughly

805
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:42,819
mid-july or right in the middle of the

806
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,970
summer in the Northern Hemisphere.

807
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:48,099
There's two lines on this stomatal

808
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,829
conductance graph here green line and a

809
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,920
black line. The green line is actually a

810
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,220
model calculation of canopy stomatal

811
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,419
conductance and we're calling it

812
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,849
potential conductance, and so what it is

813
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:05,569
is an estimate of what we expect the the

814
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,840
canopy stomatal conductance to be if

815
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,030
the plants are well watered and not

816
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,580
stressed. Then the black line is our

817
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:16,219
actual data the canopy stomatal

818
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,199
conductance. We calculated from our

819
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,480
weather measurements and our measurement

820
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,159
of the canopy temperature from the

821
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,509
infrared sensor and you can see these

822
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,570
couple days here the black line matches

823
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,090
the green line pretty well indicating

824
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,400
the plants are well water because

825
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,130
the calculated values of the model

826
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,260
conductance for measure matching the

827
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,990
model values and again the model values

828
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:44,629
give us what we expect the theoretical

829
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,240
value to be for well-watered conditions

830
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:50,449
and then you can see for a few days in a

831
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,489
row the black line as well below the

832
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:55,129
green line, meaning the actual values are

833
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,990
well under the potential values

834
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:59,479
indicating the the plants are water

835
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,530
stressed. Over here it jumps back up

836
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,280
again and we have two or three days

837
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,710
where the actual matches the potential

838
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,449
pretty well before it starts to go down.

839
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:14,539
You can see the same thing in this graph

840
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:16,969
here, this is just the ratio of the two

841
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:20,059
so you take the the black line divided by  the

842
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,190
green line. If we're near one,

843
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,559
it means the two-match. If we're

844
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,329
below one, it means the black line is

845
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:29,329
lower than the green line. So any ideas

846
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:34,869
what happened right here where it jumps up?

847
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:42,230
Well you can see it declines there. Mother

848
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,539
nature irrigated; we got almost an inch

849
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:47,779
of rainfall the cornfield that I

850
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,880
showed was naturally irrigated and when

851
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,880
the rain fell it bumped back

852
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,940
up like we would expect it to do. This

853
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,880
is just one application that you could

854
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,530
potentially pursue with infrared

855
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,780
measurements they can give you

856
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,060
information about plant canopy water

857
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:07,400
status and plant response to their

858
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,260
environment. Here were looking at stomatal

859
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,590
response. One more graph; this just shows

860
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,640
a plot of the potential value, so a

861
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,549
reference value on this axis and the

862
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,830
actual value our calculated value on

863
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,889
this axis. This is from the exact same

864
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,619
experiment in Nebraska in the United

865
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,199
States and it was corn. All were

866
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,319
doing here is plotting the 24 the days

867
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,570
immediately after rainfall when we

868
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,180
expect that our actual value should

869
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,000
match our model value and indeed that's

870
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,460
what we get, as long as the plants are

871
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,590
watered the two numbers match. So it

872
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,180
indicates that our method of getting

873
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:52,250
actual is is working pretty well, the

874
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,909
outliers are possibly when the canopy

875
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:59,179
was wet. You'll get data that

876
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:01,129
don't necessarily match the model if the

877
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,840
leaf surfaces are wet.

878
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,160
That's all I have for stomatal

879
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:09,230
conductance for the application. Are there

880
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,630
any questions about any of the IR

881
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:17,210
measurement details that we covered? Any

882
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,650
questions about this specific

883
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,530
application?
