1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm Bruce Bugbee and in this video I

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,280
want to talk about our research over

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:15,209
especially over the last 10 years and

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:18,948
even over the last 20 years of the

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:22,320
effects of colors of light on

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:26,910
photosynthesis and plant shape and I'm

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,439
calling this towards an optimal spectral

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:35,640
quality for plant growth and development

9
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:39,539
now what do we mean by plant growth and

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,270
development when we say plant growth we

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,789
mean an increase in dry weight of the

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,570
plants and that directly comes from

13
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,929
photosynthesis when we say development

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,628
we mostly mean plant shape is it a tall

15
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,369
skinny plant the short fat plant you can

16
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,460
see you could have the same sized plant

17
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:02,578
with very different shapes spectral

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,000
quality has an effect on photosynthesis

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,280
but it has a much bigger effect on plant

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,849
shape and most of the time when we're

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,430
changing ratios of colors were doing it

22
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,259
to affect plant shape and I'll walk

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,650
through this both plant growth and

24
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,469
development plant shape varies among

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,580
species different species have different

26
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:29,250
responses to spectral quality

27
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:33,688
photosynthesis does not vary among

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,239
species much at all but you will see

29
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:39,000
there's evidence that our historic

30
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,569
definition of photosynthetic photons is

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,868
now coming in to questioning so I first

32
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,359
want to acknowledge NASA they have

33
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:51,149
funded my laboratory now for over 30

34
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:55,200
years and that has allowed us to do some

35
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:58,079
very basic research on spectral quality

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,990
on photosynthesis and development we

37
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,758
also recently got a grant from the USDA

38
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,179
it's through the University of Georgia

39
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,118
it is called the lamp project lighting

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,830
approaches to maximize profits this is a

41
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:16,889
more applied project to look at

42
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,810
quality and plant shape big implications

43
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,509
for supplemental lighting in greenhouses

44
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,659
big implications for indoor agriculture

45
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,669
and vertical farming so let's get

46
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,039
started let's look at this I want to

47
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,509
acknowledge two people that in the

48
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,719
trenches that did the work

49
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:36,030
Shu Jung Jin a postdoctoral fellow and

50
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,270
now a research scientist in my lab and

51
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,699
Paul kusuma a PhD candidate he came from

52
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,150
the University of Florida the work I'm

53
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:50,189
showing you is largely done by these two

54
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,590
young scientist so we talked about what

55
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:55,409
things affect plant growth and we talked

56
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,409
about nine cardinal parameters and here

57
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,509
they are temperature humidity roots on

58
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,659
temperature nutrients oxygen wind co2

59
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,329
and light the parameter right here on

60
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,900
the top most of the time we're working

61
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:14,670
to optimize these to use the given light

62
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,099
that that we have and for generations we

63
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:20,569
haven't been able to change the light we

64
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:25,259
just optimized what we get from the Sun

65
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:29,370
now that we can change the light boom it

66
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:31,620
this is a huge parameter this we change

67
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,659
and then we re optimize everything

68
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,420
depending on the light think about it

69
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,280
when you increase the light it increases

70
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,500
the flux of water through the plant and

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,830
that automatically changes everything

72
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,110
changes the nutrient solution ratio to

73
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,630
it that makes more respiration and need

74
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,810
more oxygen they need a lot more water

75
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:54,329
it means that co2 becomes cost effective

76
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,789
to elevate temperature and humidity are

77
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:01,440
higher so we need more wind changes to

78
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:05,939
everything so lights a big deal this

79
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:10,169
slide summarizes something like 30 years

80
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:13,079
of photo biology for me personally we

81
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:19,319
have four categories of light in this

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:22,860
blue photons inhibit cell expansion now

83
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,949
that sounds terrible but if it's stem

84
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,639
elongation blue photons are terrific

85
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,519
they keep plants

86
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,579
shorter there's some variability among

87
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,560
plants but this inhibition of stell SEM

88
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:37,538
elongation means shorter plants and

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,139
that's a huge factor

90
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:43,959
it also means reduced leaf expansion

91
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:50,218
which is bad here's an example of blue

92
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:50,218
photons this is 5% blue right here

93
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:56,039
let's go back to pin there we go

94
00:04:56,908 --> 00:05:03,819
this is 5% blue right here look at how

95
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,340
tall that is and we increased the blue

96
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:09,879
to 20 and the height of the plant

97
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:12,758
decreased so there's the power of blue

98
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,759
fault runs those two plants by the way

99
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,979
our young cannabis plants their medical

100
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,528
hemp we're one of the few universities

101
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:24,430
in the United States with the license to

102
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:26,468
study medical him so we're doing

103
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,360
research on hemp along with the many

104
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:34,028
many food crops green photons facilitate

105
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,270
human vision they're primarily important

106
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:41,199
so we can diagnose subtle nutritional

107
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:43,180
disorders insects and disease there's an

108
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,430
old Chinese phrase that says the best

109
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,848
fertilizer is the footsteps of the

110
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,800
farmer and green photons are like

111
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:54,069
fertilizer because we concede the plants

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,038
and diagnose problems in the early days

113
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:59,830
of LEDs there was a misperception that

114
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:03,519
green photons were not used efficiently

115
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:06,008
and we made LEDs with blue and red

116
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,019
photons and that led to lots of problems

117
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:12,520
we have purple plants you couldn't see

118
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:14,560
them fortunately those types of LEDs are

119
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:18,310
diminishing or putting a lot more white

120
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,759
LEDs in our fixtures to get the green

121
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,009
photons so we can see the plants red

122
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,598
photons are terrific they're efficient

123
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:30,460
photosynthesis they're efficient LEDs

124
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:32,908
they're like the potatoes of the diet we

125
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,019
want a lot of red photons to drive

126
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:37,500
photosynthesis even though all of these

127
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:40,909
drive photosynthesis red photons are

128
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,740
better they're about 15

129
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:46,580
better than blue photons for

130
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:52,189
photosynthesis and finally new kid on

131
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:56,709
the block far red photons enhance cell

132
00:06:52,189 --> 00:07:00,079
division so they counteract the blue in

133
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:02,000
the same way that blue photons make them

134
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,779
shorter we can bring in the Reds to make

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,649
them tall again so the middle categories

136
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:11,899
here green and red are doing their job

137
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:15,409
they're the background light the

138
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:18,709
biologically active colors are blues and

139
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,570
far reds because we can shrink and

140
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:24,739
switch swell

141
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:27,170
stems in this business let's take a look

142
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,319
at green photons you can see here's

143
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:34,640
green lettuce under blue LEDs it looks

144
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:37,430
purple and this is that's everybody's

145
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,069
scene graphs like this these are not

146
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,290
these are not really these are magenta

147
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,959
colored LEDs but very hard to see the

148
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:50,210
plants in those alright let's take a

149
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:52,729
closer look at all of these now here's

150
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,709
far red now this is a little bit of a

151
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,950
small picture but this is white light

152
00:07:54,709 --> 00:08:00,500
and we added in this study Paul kusuma

153
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:03,560
added 10% of the photons as far red

154
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,079
they're like magic to lettuce they

155
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,290
dramatically improve cell expansion and

156
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,120
we got a much bigger lettuce plant so

157
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,210
for lettuce production for our red is

158
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,730
very powerful color of lake

159
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:18,979
unfortunately it stops with lettuce most

160
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,030
other species we add far red and we get

161
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,740
tall plants and that's unfortunate but

162
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:27,379
that's the the nature of far ready but

163
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,079
is still a powerful tool to manipulate

164
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:34,549
plant growth so there's a summary of

165
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:37,659
these colors of light now let's take a

166
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:41,569
look at how much they penetrate leaves

167
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:45,350
blue is absorbed heavily by chlorophyll

168
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,990
a and B so here's a leaf right here the

169
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,550
top and bottom of a leaf and it's

170
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,070
absorbed in the top layer

171
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:54,199
compare that to green look at green it

172
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,680
penetrates the leaf all the way to the

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,700
bottom

174
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:02,000
lights up the spongy mesophyll it's it's

175
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,399
terrific for its penetrating power red

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,839
is just like blue absorbed in the very

177
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,360
top layer of the leaf it's doesn't

178
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,880
penetrate nearly as well as green and

179
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,300
finally far-red penetrates even better

180
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:20,958
than green it goes deep into the leaf

181
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:22,789
and that's a good thing for the cases of

182
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,769
leaf so this is a this is from this

183
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:27,259
paper right here Broder son and Vogelman

184
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:30,230
it's a beautiful paper these the nice

185
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:32,509
images I added the far read they didn't

186
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,050
study far read but but these are nice

187
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:39,439
side views of a leaf with penetration of

188
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:42,319
light let's look at efficiency of LEDs

189
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,320
here's our primary colors that we get if

190
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,740
we do efficiency which is watts of

191
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:52,910
photosynthetic photon out per watt of

192
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,339
electric energy in that's efficiency

193
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:57,309
because the units in the denominator and

194
00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:02,360
the in the numerator and the denominator

195
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:05,088
exactly the same Wow blue chips not

196
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,850
fixtures yet just the chips 88%

197
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:13,400
efficient that's incredible how far boos

198
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:17,209
have come white LEDs are a phosphor

199
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,519
converted blue and we can get pretty

200
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:23,659
good phosphorus but white is a little

201
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:27,730
bit less than the blues 80% and then the

202
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:32,870
Reds and the far Reds are slightly less

203
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:35,920
efficient so this is efficiency but we

204
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,828
know that watts of energy doesn't cause

205
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,679
photosynthesis photons cause

206
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:47,498
photosynthesis so

207
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:51,489
this column is micromoles of photons per

208
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:53,379
Joule of the energy and these are the

209
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,930
peak numbers we get up these are

210
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:59,860
staggeringly high most high pressure

211
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:01,928
sodium on this comes in at about I'm

212
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:07,209
gonna put it down here high pressure

213
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:15,009
sodium comes in at one point seven maybe

214
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:18,399
one point eight LEDs are approaching

215
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:21,369
twice the efficiency LED chips not the

216
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,438
fixtures yet let's review this a second

217
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:29,220
because this is a very confusing to

218
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:36,308
people what this is it is micro moles of

219
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:40,360
photons per second divided by joules of

220
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:43,269
electricity per second and you can see

221
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:50,649
how this simplifies to micro moles per

222
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:52,839
Joule a Joule per second is a watt so we

223
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,629
can say micromoles per second per watt

224
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,730
that's the same thing here but it's the

225
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:01,178
note the key here is that the numerator

226
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:05,170
is moles of photons the denominator is

227
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:09,249
electric energy or electric power this

228
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:11,438
is power to power now this is good news

229
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:14,230
for the future because eventually these

230
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:16,208
LEDs make their way into fixtures and we

231
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,920
can do great things with them we don't

232
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:20,438
want more column what's in that third

233
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,799
column how about the price of these

234
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:25,778
what's it cost to buy these the cool

235
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,998
lights are mass-produced because of

236
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:31,058
human lighting in large quantities so

237
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:32,980
their prices drop significantly compared

238
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:38,678
to these other colors here's the

239
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:41,350
relative price 1x for white LEDs 10x for

240
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:44,798
the Reds and the blues and the far reds

241
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,308
are still the VX this is not an inherent

242
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:50,620
problem it's just economy of scale as we

243
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:52,189
make more and more and more of these by

244
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,409
the

245
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,980
Millions these prices will keep coming

246
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:02,278
down and LEDs will get more

247
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,039
cost-effective let's look at a few

248
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:09,028
spectral effects these are cannabis

249
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:14,730
plants close to harvest we did a study

250
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:17,789
with blue fraction on cannabis this is

251
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:22,230
4% now for those of you that know blue

252
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:26,819
fractions this was high pressure sodium

253
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:30,690
lights these are LEDs all of these

254
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:34,230
they're all white LEDs with different

255
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:37,220
fractions of blue and we ramped it all

256
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:40,680
the way from 4% all the way up to 20%

257
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,660
now in this case there was no difference

258
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,088
on height because we grew in

259
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:48,649
vegetatively in the same environment and

260
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:54,500
moved them into this at flowering

261
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:57,389
what about yield here's the flower yield

262
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,330
no difference it looks like there's a

263
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,879
trend and it goes back down look at the

264
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,520
standard deviations there is no

265
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:09,870
difference in yield at all among these

266
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,480
treatments it's indicating that the

267
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,580
photosynthesis was similar and all these

268
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:20,129
treatments and the partitioning to

269
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:22,920
flowers was similar this is an amazing

270
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:25,169
slide because there is a lot of people

271
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,870
that really feel that colors of light

272
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:30,809
are just magic to cannabis yield they

273
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:33,600
need just the right colors this doesn't

274
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:36,929
prove they'll never be a difference it's

275
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,329
just in this carefully done study where

276
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:41,759
all the plants are in one big room and

277
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:45,539
had the same air the same humidity the

278
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:48,990
same co2 we didn't see a difference in

279
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:51,929
yield what about the cannabinoids in the

280
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,669
plants surely this bust of blue must

281
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:56,549
have done something the next slide is

282
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:59,309
cannabinoids here's the flowers at

283
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:04,439
harvest same thing 4 to 20 percent

284
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:05,928
these were medical hemp so we have

285
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,769
mostly CBD

286
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:12,088
but some THC look at the THC point six

287
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,839
point six point six

288
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,939
exactly the same there was no effect of

289
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,059
colors of light and ratios of colors and

290
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:26,789
especially blue on THC production and

291
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:29,519
there was no effect on CBD either so the

292
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:31,618
choice of lamp through lighting cannabis

293
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:37,350
should be based on the economics of the

294
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:40,379
lights not on the proposed hypothesized

295
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,839
differences in cannabinoid synthesis and

296
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:45,178
yield of the flowers at least according

297
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,059
to this study we're replicating the

298
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:52,139
study now but it's a significant finding

299
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:54,418
for this and I'm still not recommending

300
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:58,048
any particular lights I'm just saying

301
00:15:54,418 --> 00:16:00,899
the LEDs were no better than the HBS

302
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:04,108
there were no worse than HBS however if

303
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:07,019
we did yield per kilowatt-hour

304
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:08,839
these LEDs would win they're more

305
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,970
efficient than the high pressure sodium

306
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,609
because the light intensity that

307
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,759
photosynthetic photon flux was kept

308
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:20,009
exactly equal in the study and it took

309
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,178
more energy to make the photons for high

310
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:26,220
pressure sodium in this treatment I'll

311
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:28,828
draw it right here here's a high

312
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,739
pressure sodium lamp that has a lot of

313
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:34,349
thermal radiation it's concentrated a

314
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:37,470
thousand watts in a small area so to

315
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:41,428
make the thermal radiation the same we

316
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:44,759
put a piece of tempered glass below the

317
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:46,379
light and that blocked even even more of

318
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,629
the light but it made the thermal

319
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,269
radiation more similar among these

320
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:52,589
treatments because we didn't want to get

321
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:58,499
differences in this treatment by thermal

322
00:16:52,589 --> 00:17:02,789
radiation we're also studying the edges

323
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:05,788
of forests synthetic radiation and these

324
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:10,439
are a couple final slides on that here's

325
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:12,750
our classic curve this is 400 to 700

326
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:16,860
which we always say is photosynthetic

327
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,289
radiation this in here is we call it PA

328
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:24,389
our photosynthetic radiation and

329
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:28,589
precisely P P F D now look at that sharp

330
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:32,130
cutoff right at 700 reading a photon at

331
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,929
699 is a valuable and one at 700 one is

332
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,300
not we know it's not sharp

333
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:40,080
we've just approximated it for years

334
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:44,129
because it tilts like this but we now

335
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:48,629
have a very efficient far red LED and it

336
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:51,960
peaks at seven-thirty looks like this we

337
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:55,440
have studied that LED for far red and

338
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,789
those photons are photosynthetically

339
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,769
active so we need to rethink our

340
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:04,170
definition of photosynthesis with this

341
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:07,019
in mind they're not directly

342
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,420
photosynthetic they're synergistic with

343
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:12,500
these shorter wavelengths in here and

344
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:16,279
when they're coupled together they're

345
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,980
synergistic this was discovered in the

346
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:22,769
1950s by Emerson and it's called the

347
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,930
Emerson enhancement effect but it sat

348
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:27,359
there for half a century and not we

349
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,940
didn't study an Intel now that we have

350
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,639
far red LEDs were taken a close look at

351
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,870
the value of far-red on the other end of

352
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,330
the spectrum UV photons is this a sharp

353
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:42,119
cutoff how well are these UV photons

354
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:47,609
used the next two slides show some of

355
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:51,359
our work on UV photons here's why those

356
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:54,689
edges are so important when we look at

357
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:59,849
the photon flux of these colors we have

358
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:01,320
a violet LED that Peaks right at 400 can

359
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:03,629
we effectively use that for

360
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:08,460
photosynthesis and get a lot of the

361
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:11,700
value of UV blue LEDs and here's the one

362
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,660
at 7:30 here's 700 right there that's

363
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,509
the 730 LED can we use that one turns

364
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,580
out we can for photosynthesis what about

365
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:23,700
this one then what about wavelengths in

366
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:27,029
here you often see pictures of LEDs

367
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,160
showing the energy flux at an energy

368
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:31,379
basis these are lower than these the

369
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,509
most efficient is blue but that's not

370
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,510
what drives for

371
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:38,930
synthesis its photon flux when we graph

372
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:41,390
this same data by photons the Reds and

373
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,660
the blues are virtually identical that's

374
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:47,330
a tremendous thing this is from a paper

375
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,759
that we recently got published in the

376
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:55,189
journal Nature LEDs for photons

377
00:19:49,759 --> 00:20:00,529
physiology and food and it analyzes in

378
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:04,279
this paper that economics of LEDs this

379
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:06,559
is the very famous McCree curve here's a

380
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:09,109
picture of Keith McCree as a young

381
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,970
scientist he died just a few years ago

382
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:14,389
he had a long and distinguished career

383
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,910
he was a physicist that came across the

384
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:21,710
biology he said well my these biologists

385
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:24,230
need help and he brought the excellent

386
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,240
physics background with them he this is

387
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,220
his curve laughter how the colors of

388
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,799
light caused photosynthesis it's called

389
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,200
the Makri curve now and he said let's

390
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,279
call it good we'll cut this off at 400

391
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,009
and 700 but our data indicates that this

392
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,799
curve should shift over here some like

393
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:45,529
this it doesn't it when the because of

394
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,309
the synergist 'm synergism of far-red it

395
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:52,220
shifts that curve this curve also tilts

396
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:56,210
and these photons just below 400 are

397
00:20:52,220 --> 00:21:01,839
pretty good but when you carefully read

398
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:05,960
macri's papers they're 700 there's 400

399
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:09,379
you see this graph now this graph this

400
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,569
is this this is exactly the same as this

401
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,670
it's just graphed a little bit

402
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:16,849
differently

403
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:21,170
these are and here's 400 and 700 these

404
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:24,019
bars right here were the range of

405
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:28,100
species

406
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:31,579
from his paper my students and I made

407
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:34,789
this graph from his data there was very

408
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:38,720
little variability among species in his

409
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:41,359
data but what people forget is that he

410
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,200
also in addition to taking plants from

411
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,750
the field

412
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,700
he took plants from a growth chamber he

413
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,640
grew him in a growth chamber look at the

414
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:53,600
difference some of these photons right

415
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,570
here are almost as good as red and

416
00:21:53,599 --> 00:22:01,219
they're close to UV photons there was an

417
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:03,700
enormous range of variability among

418
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,440
species in Makris trials so we're

419
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,440
examining this part of the curve right

420
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:13,960
now particularly with violet LEDs which

421
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,610
are just right here on the edge our

422
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,779
hypothesis is that the field growing

423
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:23,119
plants synthesize compounds to block UV

424
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:25,940
to protect themselves and once they

425
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,669
synthesize those the UV photons were not

426
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,340
effective in photosynthesis those

427
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,929
companies are made in the cuticle but

428
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:35,299
the growth chamber plants that didn't

429
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:39,470
see UV didn't make the compounds and now

430
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:41,299
the UV photons are valuable so this is a

431
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:45,558
cutting edge of the research we're doing

432
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:47,839
on photo biology and I'm going to stop

433
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:52,119
here and I will pick this up in another

434
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,119
video thanks for listening
