00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,610
Hello!

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,320
I'm John Huber, applications engineer with Apogee Instruments,

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,960
and in this video we will be going over some of the more frequently asked questions regarding

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,920
the operation and calibration of our SO-100 and SO-200 series oxygen sensors.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,260
Now these sensors are unique among Apogee Instruments product line in that they are user calibrated.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,860
And so one of the more frequently asked questions we get are:

7
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:32,759
What are the best practices for calibrating and applying the readings from these sensors?

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,659
So to calibrate it, you'll first want to set it up in an open-air environment with a similar

9
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:45,579
temperature, pressure, and humidity level as the sampling environment that you will

10
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,079
be operating the sensor in.

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,140
Once you've got it set up in this environment, you will want to let the sensor's millivolt

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,000
readings stabilize, and then once they have, you will want to write down or record this

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,659
millivolt reading as your calibration millivolt reading.

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:11,060
Once you have this calibration millivolt reading, you will want to use it in the formulas listed

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:18,900
in the SO-100 and SO-200 manuals in order to obtain your calibration multiplier and calibration offset.

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,460
Once you have this calibration multiplier and offset, you can use it to convert the

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,978
sensor's millivolt signal into a measure of relative oxygen concentration.

18
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:39,129
Now, the manual can be found on our website by going to the homepage, scrolling down,

19
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:48,659
to the "Support" heading, clicking "Technical Support," then selecting the "Oxygen Sensors,"

20
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,200
and clicking the link "Product Manuals" found below.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,850
In addition to the product manual, we have developed a calculator spreadsheet that will

22
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:04,699
be posted under the "Helpful Articles and Links" section that will walk you through

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,830
and run these calculations for you.

24
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,719
So to use this spreadsheet, you'll want to follow these steps.

25
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,949
First, enter your sensor model.

26
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:20,679
In this case, we'll pick the SO-110.

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,450
Next, you want to enter your calibration millivolt reading that you recorded.

28
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,429
In this case, we'll pick 45.

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,670
And you can see, once I enter my calibration millivolt reading, the spreadsheet now gives

30
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:41,729
me my calibration multiplier and calibration offset that I can use to convert my sensor's

31
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:48,519
millivolt readings into a measure of relative oxygen concentration.

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,150
An additional thing that this spreadsheet does is it allows you to correct for changes

33
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,300
in environmental conditions.

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:04,610
Now this is important because the oxygen sensor measures, or outputs, an millivolt signal

35
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:12,280
based on absolute oxygen concentrations, which we convert into relative oxygen concentrations.

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,580
The reason we don't just use absolute concentrations is because many environmental factors affect them.

37
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:27,020
For example, if you're at sea level, the relative oxygen concentration in open air is going

38
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:36,840
to be roughly 20.95 %. On top of Mount Everest, it's also going to be 20.95 % but,

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,439
the absolute concentration of oxygen between these two environments will be very different.

40
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,899
So, keeping that in mind, when you're using an oxygen sensor that's been calibrated in

41
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,000
one environment, and you take it to a very different environment, you will need to make

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,080
sure to correct it's readings for changes in temperature, pressure, and humidity.

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,219
And if you would like more information on why this happens and how these corrections

44
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:09,599
are applied and how we came by these equations to apply these corrections,

45
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,658
that information can be found in the SO-100 and SO-200 product manual.

46
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:20,808
But in this case, let's go ahead and show you how to enter your information into this

47
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:24,420
spreadsheet and apply the corrections.

48
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,360
First you're going to want to enter the environmental conditions for your calibration environment

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,310
starting with temperature.

50
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:41,060
So let's select our units for temperature as Celsius (C) and then let's enter a value of 25 degrees.

51
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:49,699
Now let's say the humidity linear calibration environment was 10 %, so we'll go ahead and punch that in.

52
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:57,959
Next, you'll want to enter either the elevation of your calibration environment in order to

53
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,139
estimate the barometric pressure of that environment, or enter barometric pressure directly.

54
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:10,459
We'll enter the barometric pressure value by clicking the button on the left here saying "Use Calibration Pressure."

55
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:21,899
and we'll enter the barometric pressure in kPa of the calibration environment as, let's say, 89.5.

56
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,659
Now that we have our calibration environment conditions entered,

57
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,520
we can move on to our sample information.

58
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,699
First, we'll want to start by entering the sample millivolt value,

59
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:39,818
and let's go ahead and make up a value of 44 for this example.

60
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:46,839
Now you can see, the spreadsheet has already produced an uncorrected oxygen reading based

61
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:55,060
on the information we gave it for the calibration readings and the sample millivolt reading that we just entered.

62
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,980
Since that millivolt reading for the sample is a little bit lower, the oxygen reading

63
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,120
reported by this spreadsheet is also lower at 20.4 %.

64
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,019
But it's important to remember this has not been corrected.

65
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:14,278
So, if your environment that you're sampling in is different from your calibration environment,

66
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:19,009
the actual relative oxygen concentration will be different.

67
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:22,480
So, let's go ahead and apply those corrections.

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,900
First, we'll need to enter our sample environment conditions starting with temperature once again.

69
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,659
Let's go ahead and enter it in Farenheit (F) this time.

70
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,300
And let's say our sample environment was 75 degrees.

71
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:47,520
Next, let's enter our humidity for our sample environment, and let's say that's about 50 %.

72
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,838
Next, we want to enter either the elevation or barometric pressure once again.

73
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:58,199
This time we'll use elevation to estimate barometric pressure.

74
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:09,839
So we'll select our units as meters, and then let's say it was an elevation of 1,500 meters.

75
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,119
And now to apply corrections based on the information we have entered into this sheet,

76
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,060
simply click the check boxes.

77
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,600
So let's correct for humidity.

78
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,540
Let's correct for pressure.

79
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,560
And let's correct for temperature.

80
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,360
So now, you can see, based on the difference in environmental conditions between the calibration

81
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:44,800
environment and the sample environment, the oxygen reading for our sample environment is 21.9 %.

82
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,160
Now once again this is because the temperature, pressure, and humidity have

83
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,760
changed between the calibration environment and the sample environment.

84
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:01,039
Once again that's why it's so important to calibrate your oxygen sensor in an environment similar

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,199
to it's sampling environment to minimize the need for these corrections.

86
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:13,019
However, if that's not an option, you can use these corrections to correct your oxygen sensor's readings.

87
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:20,759
And once again, both the oxygen sensor manual and this spreadsheet can be found

88
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,959
in our "Support" page for the "Oxygen Sensor"

89
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:35,600
and also cover the subjects that are covered in this video in very great detail.

90
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:43,899
