1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
I'm Bruce Bugbee president of Apogee

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,240
instruments and in today's video we'd

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,240
like to talk about net radiation and I

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,309
want to talk about the evolution of

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,039
measurements and models to get to this

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,839
key parameter and particularly the

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
evolution of instruments and I'm going

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,730
to show you in a few minutes some of the

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,210
instruments that we've used to measure

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,010
this here's why it's so important we

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,160
talk about it all the time but not to

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,929
pretty has a good understanding of it

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,409
what we really want to know is how much

14
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:40,439
to irrigate crops and there's no sensor

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,808
to measure the flux of water vapor

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,030
coming out of a crop directly we always

17
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,070
use in direct measurements one of the

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,859
most time-honoured and classic

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,079
measurements is to measure all the

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,030
parameters is it called the energy

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,469
balance model and measure all the

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,058
parameters around it and then by

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:03,448
subtraction get at transpiration here's

24
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:07,618
what the model looks like so we have our

25
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:14,868
n which is the thing we're talking about

26
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:22,009
equals lambda e T evapotranspiration

27
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:25,289
plus h the sensible heat flux plus G is

28
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,329
soil heat flux now these are classic

29
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,659
symbols Gedo need to know them to

30
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,519
understand net radiation except we can

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,090
do a reasonable job of measuring this

32
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:39,239
and this and if we can measure net

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,450
radiation by subtraction we can

34
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:45,599
calculate the irrigation needs of a crop

35
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,159
now this exact same simple model is used

36
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:52,589
to determine global warming as well so

37
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,420
net radiation is a key driver so we

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,880
really need accurate measurements of

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:03,149
that both for global warming issues and

40
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:05,179
for crop irrigation needs so let's take

41
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,179
a look at the state of the art of this

42
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,909
about 10 years ago

43
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,959
2005 the American Society for civil

44
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:17,030
engineers came out with this book

45
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,718
drop evapotranspiration and this whole

46
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,859
book is about the details of calculating

47
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:27,169
that equation I just drew up there and

48
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:29,900
in the beginning of the book it makes

49
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:33,018
this statement net radiation is

50
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,599
difficult to measure so we recommend

51
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,870
this is a whole society we recommend

52
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:41,030
modeling net radiation from shortwave

53
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,329
radiation vapor pressure and air

54
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:49,969
temperature this prediction is highly

55
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:52,069
accurate so we measure we model a lot of

56
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,650
things in science we modeled the things

57
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:57,469
we have trouble measuring but we

58
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,780
co-evolved measurements and models to

59
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:03,049
get the most accurate analysis of

60
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,209
everything we do I want to look in a

61
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,859
minute at where we've come since this

62
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,139
statement was written in terms of

63
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:12,409
instruments to measure net radiation

64
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:15,639
now it's worth talking about the person

65
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:18,590
that was the editor of this book this is

66
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,689
my friend and colleague Rick Talon who

67
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,449
was at Utah State University when this

68
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:25,250
he did all this work and he felt

69
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,560
strongly about this because he saw a lot

70
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,229
of people making bad measurements and he

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,139
said it should you should model it the

72
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:36,290
model for this is not all that trivial

73
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:38,090
here it is four components some

74
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:40,429
assumptions for these things are not

75
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,169
going to get into this model but you can

76
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,090
you can easily look at it in the book

77
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:47,000
read can pause on this slide and see all

78
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:51,280
the components so the models got plenty

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,549
of challenges as well now let's switch

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:00,019
to measurements from the model and for

81
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:04,430
this we fast forward four years to 2009

82
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,669
we did a massive field study of all the

83
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:13,449
state-of-the-art net radiometers at the

84
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:17,209
time and ran them for all summer long

85
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:19,519
carefully cleaned the domes on a daily

86
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,209
basis level them here's all the

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,759
instruments on our on our rig one two

88
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,909
three four five different types of

89
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,490
instruments three replicates of the

90
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,980
here's the models and the the number of

91
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,449
outputs of each now let's before we get

92
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,200
into the number of nachos let's take a

93
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,879
look at these

94
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:43,310
now before I even show you these we were

95
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,639
studying net radiation well before this

96
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:52,069
with state-of-the-art instruments at the

97
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,319
time and let me show you a very classic

98
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:57,430
instrument this one is in our museum now

99
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,199
we didn't use it in the study but

100
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,829
instruments precision instruments used

101
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,219
to come in wood boxes and this is a

102
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:10,009
Swiss take o-net radiometer made by a

103
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,770
swiss company that was state-of-the-art

104
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:16,370
for many years had to have a pump and

105
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:19,339
inflate the domes but it better de

106
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,560
tempted to do short wave and long wave

107
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:24,289
measurements and it's a it's a gorgeous

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:30,199
instrument it's since been replaced by

109
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:34,040
several other instruments let's start at

110
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:37,069
the low end one of our instruments was

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:41,210
this one this is a radiation in energy

112
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:44,569
balance systems model q 7.1 it attempts

113
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:46,399
to get at radiation by on all of these

114
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:49,490
Arnette so they have an incoming and an

115
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,620
outgoing just by one simple blackbody

116
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,740
that attempts to balance short and long

117
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,379
wave radiation this is the lowest cost

118
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,139
of these instruments in this study and

119
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:03,050
we're going to look at how this did the

120
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,449
next one up is a tip and Sonnen in our

121
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,840
light you can see these fine plates on

122
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,939
here this again is similar doing net and

123
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,418
long wave radiation with one single

124
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:16,939
output from this this is sensitive to

125
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:19,370
wind wind cools it so there's a wind

126
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:22,969
correction for this which we used in

127
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,819
this study then we keep going up this is

128
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,240
the Hux of flux that you can see these

129
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:32,379
on the screen but now look at this

130
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,990
instrument four separate sensors

131
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:39,319
shortwave in shortwave out long wave in

132
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,280
long wave out four outputs this is a

133
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,759
considerable step up from

134
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,539
these other instruments and then finally

135
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:53,250
the most expensive instrument of all is

136
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:56,700
this Kip and zonin CNR one which is

137
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:05,009
shown in our pictures oh we've got the

138
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:07,709
CNR one in this study the CNR one is the

139
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:10,110
predecessor to this that's a big uns

140
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:12,120
heavy instrument right here this came

141
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,340
out after this study it's a similar

142
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,220
instrument same company it's a slight

143
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:20,399
upgrade from that again it has four

144
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:26,130
outputs two on the bottom two on the top

145
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:30,089
so how'd this come out well these are

146
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:33,149
ranked by from the bottom to the top in

147
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:36,599
increasing order of price and not

148
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:40,079
terribly surprisingly the accuracy went

149
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,580
up with the increasing price so it's

150
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,209
sort of like you get what you pay for

151
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:48,750
but one of the absolutely clear things

152
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:51,769
we found out about this was these

153
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,540
instruments that had four outputs were

154
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:56,069
fundamentally more accurate than the

155
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,310
ones that only had one or two

156
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,990
remember these instruments that just

157
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,538
have two sides I guess they just give

158
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,870
you one number and they attempt to

159
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:08,969
separate short wave fluxes and long wave

160
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,519
fluxes and that's very challenging to do

161
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:16,770
it's easier to measure them separately

162
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:20,639
so on a put on this a green box around

163
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:22,500
this because the two most expensive ones

164
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,300
with four outputs we're also the most

165
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:31,740
accurate in this study so this was a lot

166
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,918
of data it very carefully analyzed with

167
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,580
multiple outputs this is Mark blonde

168
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,649
twist who was the apogee chief scientist

169
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,349
that I've worked with for a long time on

170
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,870
this out here polishing and leveling

171
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,730
these instruments in the field and at

172
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,459
the end of the summer we published this

173
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,310
in agriculture and forest meteorology so

174
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:55,169
you can go to this paper and see all the

175
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:57,509
details of this study and the

176
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,759
separate pros and cons but in a nutshell

177
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:03,120
the thing we came away from this was

178
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,278
with from this was four-way instruments

179
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,759
are better than doesn't look lesser

180
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:14,220
instruments now I said models might be

181
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,149
better than measurements let's take a

182
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,240
look at what we found from that all of

183
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,990
the instruments in this study were more

184
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,740
accurate than the model so we

185
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,139
fundamentally disproved that statement

186
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,659
that if the instruments are level and

187
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:37,070
clean they're more accurate than the

188
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:39,750
model we ought to be measuring radiation

189
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,560
the more expensive instruments were a

190
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:47,070
lot more accurate and how far off were

191
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:49,799
they there's a simple graph out of many

192
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,110
that we did the model was 10 percent

193
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:56,399
high compared to measurements there's

194
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:58,528
the measurements so 10 percent height

195
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,500
means I have you know that's not that

196
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:03,448
much you're going to overwater 10

197
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,870
percent waist 10 percent to the water

198
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:09,028
water is a really precious resource I

199
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:12,448
consider a 10 percent error in this

200
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:15,208
model to be pretty significant and since

201
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:17,759
this paper came out we have seen an

202
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:22,409
enormous number of people switch to

203
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:25,338
measuring this from modeling it this was

204
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:28,350
also published in another paper in

205
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,329
agricultural water management that

206
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,800
really made the point that this the

207
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:34,948
measurements are better than the model

208
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,559
so our colleague Rick Allen was on

209
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:41,278
record saying the model is the best so

210
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:44,669
guess what Rick Allen he became a

211
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:47,220
co-author with us on this paper to make

212
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:49,889
a very clear statement that the

213
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,940
instruments are better so that led to

214
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:56,338
using instruments now we fast forward a

215
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,540
few more years and because Apogee

216
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:03,449
instruments has a long history of

217
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:06,240
measuring these parameters Apogee

218
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:07,679
started working on a new design for a

219
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,089
net radiometer

220
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:15,479
that incorporated four components into a

221
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:19,110
single instrument and has an

222
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,990
intermediate price this is the design

223
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:26,039
that Apogee has just recently released

224
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:29,940
after four years of refinement and

225
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:33,120
testing it's a 4 component radiometer

226
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,690
short wave in short wave out long within

227
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,879
long wave out this would take up all of

228
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,670
these instruments take up a lot of

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,610
channels on a data acquisition system

230
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:47,110
and which are precious channels that can

231
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,480
be used for other

232
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:55,759
things so when this we made the output

233
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,879
sdi-12 and it only takes up an SDI 12

234
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:02,360
channel you can have multiple sensors in

235
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,250
the same channel so we consider this a

236
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,850
pretty fundamental breakthrough in the

237
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,720
world of measuring radiation it's small

238
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,790
easy to level and has I'm going to show

239
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,610
you a minute has very comparable

240
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:21,049
accuracy to the highest end instruments

241
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:24,339
that cost considerably more one of the

242
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:28,429
challenges of measuring radiation is

243
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:35,540
condensation on sensors and snow on

244
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:37,219
sensors for that reason the Hux of flux

245
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:40,399
has a heater in it

246
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,079
it's a one-and-a-half watt heater so

247
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,958
it's very significant you have to have a

248
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:48,349
big solar panel to run the seeder the

249
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:51,528
Kip and zonin also for extra money has

250
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:56,269
this shield it's both of these high end

251
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:58,009
instruments have heaters to try and keep

252
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:01,188
the instrument cleaned so you make

253
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:05,028
accurate measurements in all weather the

254
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:07,549
apogee because it's smaller has tiny

255
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:10,759
heaters and each of these four sensors

256
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:12,528
to keep the domes clean let's look at

257
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,430
what that looks like when we put these

258
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:18,980
heaters in here's a winter day few years

259
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:20,899
ago frost in the morning it didn't even

260
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,629
snow is just frost is covering

261
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,789
everything the heaters are clean and

262
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:27,799
this is just a fraction of the power

263
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:31,219
this can easily be run from solar

264
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,219
powered weather stations we got a lot of

265
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,920
pictures this thing here's the same

266
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,689
sensor different angle showing the frost

267
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,629
this part doesn't need to be heated here

268
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:44,028
but these are nice and clean so that was

269
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:48,470
another advanced being able to heat this

270
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:52,159
thing how accurate is it well we have

271
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,870
deployed this in the field you can tell

272
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,039
this is Utah cuz we have mountains in

273
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,649
the background over a big alfalfa field

274
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:04,159
over 15 months

275
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:06,409
over a year we compared them to the

276
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,019
high-end Kip and zonin this is the most

277
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:12,588
expensive of all the instruments and we

278
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:16,399
had three triplicate Apogee net

279
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:18,160
radiometers on this tower so through the

280
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,178
winter through the summer

281
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:24,919
comparing the accuracy here's the data

282
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:27,860
here's the Kip and zonin here's the

283
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:31,808
apogee 15 months in the field all of

284
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:34,909
them track the Kip and zonin very

285
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:37,428
accurately there's a few scattered

286
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:40,039
points in here and this is because

287
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:42,860
something got on the sensor sometimes it

288
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:47,088
got on the reference sensor and caused

289
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:49,850
problems this was not heated this didn't

290
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,819
have the heated shield so there are

291
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,069
times when this had an error but the

292
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:58,278
point of this is we're very pleased with

293
00:14:55,068 --> 00:15:01,308
this accuracy it's been over a year

294
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:06,370
since we've done that so the take-home

295
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:10,219
messages from all of this now are its

296
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:14,659
cost effective to measure net radiation

297
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:18,559
and as opposed to modeling it on all

298
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:22,009
stations and in the world of

299
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:24,828
cost-effectiveness we feel that this

300
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:27,938
Apogee net radiometer really fits a

301
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:32,659
niche for very high accuracy and yet

302
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:35,949
moderate cost thanks for listening we'll

303
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:38,009
talk to you again in another session

304
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,009
you
