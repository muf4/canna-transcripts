2
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,289
we kind of introduced my topic at the

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,380
end of his last presentations and talk a

4
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,050
bit about spectral reflectance and I put

5
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:34,829
all of these pictures and the different

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,710
scales on my introductory slides because

7
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,239
there's lots of different scales that

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,520
you can consider when measuring

9
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,149
reflectance everywhere from a single

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,260
leaf measurement all the way up to

11
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:49,439
satellite measurements of the Earth's

12
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,238
surface so I think mostly what I'm going

13
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,869
to talk about is more reflectance

14
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:59,218
principles but we'll be down in more of

15
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:02,009
this range of scale but some of or most

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,829
of what I will say will apply to all of

17
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:08,429
the scales and again if you have any

18
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:12,539
questions feel free to ask while I'm

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,960
going through the slides reflectance is

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,799
a pretty simple concept we just divide

21
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,109
the reflected radiation so everything

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,500
that's bouncing off the surface and

23
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:28,680
coming back by the radiation that's

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,219
incident on the surface and it's

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,189
powerful simple but powerful because we

26
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:38,609
can learn a lot about surface properties

27
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:42,419
surface conditions based on how the

28
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:44,819
reflectance signal changes we've already

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,978
seen this plot more than one time today

30
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,599
so I won't spend too much time on it but

31
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:53,609
it shows the shortwave radiation

32
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:57,359
spectrum at Earth's surface and so in

33
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:59,250
most applications not all because we can

34
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,430
do this in the laboratory and we can

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,319
also do it on small leaf samples where

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,409
we often use artificial lights that

37
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,288
we're talking about the scales of plants

38
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,930
canopies and flux towers things like

39
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,750
that typically the light surface or the

40
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,629
lights or

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:21,939
is the Sun and so incident radiation is

42
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,460
these data that you see right here then

43
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:27,009
we have to invert our sensor and measure

44
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,189
the reflected signal and that goes in

45
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:34,560
the numerator of our equation when we do

46
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:37,359
that it looks like this for some

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,090
surfaces that we're all familiar with I

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:46,570
have water soil a plant canopy and snow

49
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:50,099
so you can see one thing that sticks out

50
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:54,219
immediately from this slide is we can

51
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:56,859
use reflectance to characterize what it

52
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:58,359
is at the surface I don't know that

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,670
that's necessarily a major application

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,350
because there's other ways as

55
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:06,339
characterizing what's going on at the

56
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:09,280
surface but the reflective signatures

57
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,830
are very very different when we move

58
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,830
from one surface to the next

59
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,429
so this gives you an idea of how much it

60
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,119
costs to measure the different

61
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,040
wavelength ranges so to get the the

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,489
visible spectrum and a little bit of the

63
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:32,639
near-infrared maybe 350 or 400

64
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,550
nanometers up to about a thousand

65
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,329
nanometers or so is this reasonable

66
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,340
price tag then to get that same

67
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,110
wavelength range plus more of the

68
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,409
near-infrared now we're talking about

69
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,120
maybe half of the solar spectrum we're

70
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:53,090
getting a bigger price tag and to get

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,659
the whole spectrum we're talking about a

72
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,670
lot more money so the price scales with

73
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:03,599
the amount of information that you're

74
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:08,699
measuring and I'm mostly going to talk

75
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:12,889
about this range of 350 or 400 up into

76
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:16,289
the a thousand range largely because

77
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:18,569
that's the more affordable range and

78
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,569
that's the type of instruments that we

79
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:26,849
typically deal with at least at Apogee

80
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:29,310
instruments so I want to focus on the

81
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,870
reflectance spectrum for a plant canopy

82
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,189
for a minute you can see there are a lot

83
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,959
of unique features here one that we

84
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,610
already talked about earlier is the

85
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,319
photosynthetically active radiation

86
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:45,930
range which is 400 to 700 nanometers the

87
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,120
reason that it's so much lower than a

88
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,819
lot of the other parts of the

89
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,800
reflectance spectrums because green

90
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,259
leaves have a lot of chlorophyll in them

91
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,030
and the chlorophyll is absorbing all of

92
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,120
the photosynthetic photons for

93
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:03,059
photosynthesis and so this whole portion

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,889
of the spectrum is depressed small

95
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,600
values because all of those photons are

96
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,599
being absorbed for photosynthesis

97
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,240
and within that range we have this

98
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:14,728
little green peak we're all familiar

99
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,860
with it you can see it applied plants or

100
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:18,838
green

101
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,889
there's the red edge so the point where

102
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:22,199
we transition from the

103
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:25,110
photosynthetically active range to the

104
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,449
near-infrared range it jumps up here

105
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,180
because everything beyond about 700 or

106
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,509
non-photosynthetic photons so a high

107
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,449
percentage of them are being reflected

108
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:41,399
and all these dips here are water

109
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:43,499
absorption bands so healthy plant leaves

110
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,180
tend to have a lot of water in them and

111
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:48,300
once you get out into the near infrared

112
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,028
range water is a pretty good absorber of

113
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:57,149
certain wavelength there's a water band

114
00:05:51,028 --> 00:06:00,598
about 970 or 980 another one around 11

115
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:04,588
to 1200 another one about 1400 and then

116
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:07,259
another one about 1900 nanometers and so

117
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:10,939
we can learn something about potentially

118
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:14,069
about photosynthesis about water

119
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:18,588
different variables based on

120
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,588
measurements of plant reflectance

121
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:28,259
this slide illustrates how you would do

122
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:29,759
it for a single leaf so typically this

123
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,490
is done in the laboratory and it

124
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,579
requires an artificial light source

125
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:40,220
here's a fiber-optic cable that's going

126
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:42,750
to absorb the light take it back to a

127
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,150
spectral radiometer which actually makes

128
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,779
the measurement so when we start we have

129
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:51,769
to have a reflectance spectrum a

130
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:55,769
reference reflectance spectrum we use a

131
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:58,680
small highly reflective white surface to

132
00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:02,609
give us a reference spectrum essentially

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,620
this would represent the denominator in

134
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,050
the equation when we make this

135
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,910
measurement this would represent all of

136
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,879
the incident radiation assuming our

137
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:16,080
reflectance panel has a high

138
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:19,740
reflectivity something near 100% and

139
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:22,229
then we after we make our measurement on

140
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,870
a reflectance panel and often this is

141
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,479
made out of spectra lawn or PTFE some

142
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,668
material that has really high

143
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:34,079
reflectivity near 100% once we get our

144
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:37,918
reference measurement the denominator of

145
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:41,939
the reflectance equation then we can put

146
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:44,159
the sample under the light source and

147
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,110
measure reflectance from the sample and

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,500
you'll notice we have to have some kind

149
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:53,430
of flat black background behind the

150
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,680
sample Bruce talked a little bit ago

151
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,629
about how reflectance and transmission

152
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,269
spectra look very similar they're kind

153
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:01,860
of analogues of each other well if you

154
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:04,500
have some photons that are being

155
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,389
transmitted through the leaf and you

156
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,189
have a highly reflective background like

157
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,099
if we flip the leaf over top of our

158
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,959
reflectance panel some of those

159
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,570
transmitted photons would reflect off

160
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,579
the white background we transmitted back

161
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:21,050
through the lease and actually get

162
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:23,250
measured as reflected photon rather than

163
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,930
photons that were transmitted all the

164
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,418
way through the leaf reflected off the

165
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,610
back and then transmitted back through

166
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:31,829
the leaf until you

167
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,649
when you measure your sample you put it

168
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:36,569
on top of some kind of flat black

169
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,360
background that has a very low

170
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,820
reflectivity so we can assume that all

171
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,778
the reflection comes from the sample

172
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,028
itself in this case a leaf and so this

173
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,700
measurement as I mentioned it represents

174
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,379
the denominator of our equation this

175
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,680
measurement over here represents the

176
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:58,500
numerator of the equation so this is how

177
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,019
you would make a laboratory measurement

178
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,028
of a single leaf sample and when we move

179
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:09,450
to the field to do it for a plant canopy

180
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:11,458
for example the actual method isn't that

181
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:16,440
much different I'll explain it when we

182
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:19,528
get there so just to give you an idea of

183
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,200
the kind of information that leaf

184
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:26,759
reflectance might indicate we have two

185
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,620
reflectance spectra here one where the

186
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,838
the peak in the green and then some of

187
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,850
this radiation in the red is more

188
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,870
reflective than the other the

189
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,209
reflectance is higher I should say this

190
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,839
would represent a well fertilized leaf

191
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:45,509
with a high nitrogen content this one

192
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,750
would represent potential of nitrogen

193
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:51,259
depth so you get changes in the spectrum

194
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,480
as a function of properties of the leaf

195
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:59,009
here it's related to nitrogen but there

196
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,480
could be other other properties that we

197
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:06,740
can we can measure by analyzing the

198
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,740
changes in the reflectance spectrum

199
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,919
and so when we move to the field the

200
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,559
reflectance for a plant canopy look

201
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,990
similar to the reflectance of a single

202
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,609
leaf so the previous data were for a

203
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,100
single leaf this is actually a

204
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:29,500
reflectance spectrum that we measured on

205
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:32,470
a plant canopy in times test we're

206
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,519
interested you know very specific

207
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,850
portions of the of the spectrum one that

208
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,279
everybody I think is familiar with is

209
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,470
the difference between red reflectance

210
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:48,549
and near-infrared reflectance so I

211
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:51,430
highlighted them here and for a long

212
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:54,279
time we've used reflectance measurements

213
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:55,359
of these two wavelengths somewhere in

214
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,129
the red and somewhere in the

215
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:03,909
near-infrared to quantify NDVI you've

216
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:05,409
probably heard this acronym before it's

217
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:08,289
the normalized difference vegetation

218
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:10,899
index where we take near-infrared

219
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:13,269
reflectance - red reflectance in the

220
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:17,350
numerator and then we take the sum of

221
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:20,470
the two in the denominator because we

222
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,960
have strong absorption of photons and

223
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,100
low reflection in the red and high

224
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,850
reflection in the near-infrared

225
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,389
essentially NDVI is a green index and we

226
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,670
can measure it it tells us about you

227
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:38,919
know how much leaf area is covering the

228
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:40,839
surface how green the surface is there

229
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,110
are small devices this is an instrument

230
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,790
from from decagon devices that we can

231
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:51,669
use to measure specific indices like

232
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:54,069
NDVI so this small sensor that I've

233
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:58,089
shown here is essentially a 2 channel or

234
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:00,820
a 2 band radiometer it has one sensor in

235
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,160
it that measures the red range and

236
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,070
another sensor in it that measures the

237
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:08,889
near-infrared range it makes those

238
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:12,640
measurements does this calculation

239
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:16,299
internally and outputs and NDVI values

240
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,580
so if we're only interested in in

241
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:23,829
you know specific indices like NDVI then

242
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,379
small low-cost radiometers like this can

243
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,930
be very useful I showed some prices

244
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:32,080
earlier of spectra radiometers and you

245
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:34,589
know 3000 to 6000 was a rough estimate

246
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,460
of an instrument that would give you

247
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:40,899
this reflectance spectrum this

248
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,379
two-channel radiometer is about an order

249
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:46,000
of magnitude lower this would be maybe a

250
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:50,549
300 dollar instrument somewhere in in

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,409
that ballpark but red and near-infrared

252
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:56,349
reflectance aren't the only wavelengths

253
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:59,199
of interest the red edge can be very

254
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,379
informative often we're interested in

255
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,160
blue reflectance and there's a another

256
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:08,200
index kind of like NDVI the mathematical

257
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,069
form is exactly the same you'll see in

258
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,730
just a second that uses reflectance at

259
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:19,090
531 nanometers our green wavelength and

260
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:23,009
reflectance at 570 nanometers out of a

261
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:26,259
yellow wavelength and it's called PRI

262
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:31,000
this means photochemical reflectance

263
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:33,549
index so we take the reflectance at 570

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,970
and minus the reflective at 531 and

265
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:41,740
divide that by the sum of the two and we

266
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,830
get this PRI and it's still being

267
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,110
studied there's a lot of work going on

268
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:51,000
to better understand what PRI is

269
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:53,769
actually measuring but it seems to be

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,200
closely related to light use efficiency

271
00:13:53,769 --> 00:14:01,409
of plant and so PRI and NDVI we can

272
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,910
measure again with these these small

273
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:06,159
low-cost devices like this and I will

274
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,259
say that decagon also has a PRI

275
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:11,350
instrument in addition to the NDVI

276
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:15,370
instrument and there turns out there are

277
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,769
a whole host of fairly simple reflective

278
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,320
indices that have been published in the

279
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:22,779
literature here's a relatively recent

280
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,940
review paper this is actually a table

281
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,740
from that paper

282
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,610
we're 20 different

283
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,529
I think there's 20 of them on there

284
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,720
relatively simple reflective indices are

285
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:39,470
shown here that are all attempting to

286
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,840
quantify different things we've got

287
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,410
chlorophyll content photosynthetic

288
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,790
activity liquid water content

289
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:51,579
carotenoids and xanthophylls cycle

290
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:53,629
anthocyanins canopy water content

291
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,580
there's lots of different plant

292
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:57,580
properties that people have attempted to

293
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:04,419
estimate using reflectance indices or

294
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,679
learn about using reflectance indices

295
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:10,129
you actually got a list of from a

296
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,620
colleague one time its unpublished but

297
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:15,889
the list that she had compiled had 62

298
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,929
different reflectance indices in it so

299
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:20,779
there's a lot of these things out there

300
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:24,259
I guess the point that I want to make is

301
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:29,089
if again if you're interested in in one

302
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:31,970
index like just NDVI or just PRI these

303
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,160
relatively simple to band and sometimes

304
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,830
I've seen three or four band radiometers

305
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,909
are available to give you information on

306
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:44,030
a single index but it makes sense that

307
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:47,600
why not use the whole spectrum if we can

308
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:51,379
rather than trying to just build sensors

309
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,600
for specific indexes only and so that's

310
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:57,009
what a spectral radiometer gives you is

311
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,680
the measurement of the entire spectrum

312
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:03,710
and one of the reasons I think that

313
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:10,489
maybe this hasn't been more widely used

314
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:12,860
or is maybe just starting to be to be

315
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,379
more and more applied in in research and

316
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,139
especially in commercial operations in

317
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:21,080
the past spectra radiometers tended to

318
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:24,189
be expensive oftentimes they're large

319
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,889
and heavy and so

320
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,040
there and they require operator or

321
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:32,710
computer and so they're not necessarily

322
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:35,620
easy instruments to take from the

323
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,930
laboratory and use routinely in the

324
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,779
field it can be a little bit challenging

325
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:44,589
so hence there is a lot of use of these

326
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:48,879
small narrowband single or excuse me

327
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:52,300
dual or three Chandler radiometers so

328
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,490
the apogee spectroradiometer we tried to

329
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:57,179
design it to overcome some of these

330
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,690
these challenges and limitations and

331
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:03,549
make it more of a field instrument in

332
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,420
addition to a lab instrument if you

333
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:10,809
wanted to use it in the laboratory some

334
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,279
of the the features are highlighted here

335
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:17,828
but really we wanted to try to make

336
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:21,250
something low-cost small lightweight and

337
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:23,078
there it is compared to a couple quantum

338
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:29,259
sensors just so you can get an idea of

339
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:32,259
the size and so some applications and I

340
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:34,029
won't go into a ton of detail here this

341
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,940
is the kind of thing that you could do

342
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:39,250
with a unit like this continuous

343
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,330
automated measurement of plant canopies

344
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,339
who often were interested in plant

345
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:47,710
response to environmental change and

346
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:50,949
this might be one way to quantify that

347
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,559
measuring reflectance spectra another

348
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,809
potential application is precision

349
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,690
agriculture you know rapid field

350
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:02,679
phenotype of crop plant looking for

351
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,980
differences in genetic lines differences

352
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:09,060
in different treatments we can mount

353
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:15,269
them on mobile instruments and collect

354
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:15,269
high-frequency data for precision Eric

355
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:20,809
and so I said a few minutes ago when I

356
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,000
was explaining how to make the

357
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:26,539
reflectance measurement in the lab but

358
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,119
the procedure was relatively similar for

359
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,769
making measurements in the field well so

360
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,409
there's a couple of different approaches

361
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:37,099
that you can take one would be to mount

362
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:40,820
one instrument level and looking up and

363
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:43,759
another instrument pointing down at the

364
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:45,889
plant canopies so this gives you the

365
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,710
reflected spectrum this gives you the

366
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:54,080
incoming spectrum the ratio of the two

367
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:55,940
is a reflectance measurement the using

368
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,939
an approach like this you actually have

369
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,820
to match the spectral radiometer so in

370
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,180
essence it's a field calibration we want

371
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:08,500
we want the data for this one to match

372
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:11,990
this one when we have a hundred percent

373
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,490
reflectance so what that means is you

374
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:19,190
have to use a reflectance panel which is

375
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,220
a diffused reflector with reflectance

376
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:25,730
near 100% to match the spectral

377
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,440
radiometer zoom before you start it

378
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:32,589
essentially means you have to put your

379
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,730
reference panel your reflectance panel

380
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:38,029
underneath the downward looking

381
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,700
instrument and then calibrate this one

382
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:43,849
to match the output from that one and

383
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,009
then when you remove the reflectance

384
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:50,689
panel you can take the ratio directly

385
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:53,460
will be a measurement of reflectance so

386
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:57,090
there is some

387
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,950
you say requirements of users being in

388
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:01,500
the field to to make the system work

389
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,528
before you start we have to match the

390
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,200
spectra radiometers another option is

391
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:09,058
you could you could make measurements

392
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,509
with the single downward looking

393
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:15,058
instruments if we take this one away we

394
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,640
can make measurements with this one by

395
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:20,278
saving the measurement when we've got a

396
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,259
reflectance panel here this becomes the

397
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:24,109
denominator in our equation and then

398
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:26,609
when we remove the reflectance panel

399
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:28,259
subsequent measurements become the

400
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:30,509
numerator in the equation we just take

401
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,970
the ratio of the two the challenge with

402
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:35,908
doing it this way is every time the sky

403
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,429
conditions change we have to make a new

404
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:41,520
measurement of the background radiation

405
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:44,130
with the reflectance panel because the

406
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,929
if the sky conditions change that means

407
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,299
the denominator and the reflectance

408
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,750
equation changed we have to account for

409
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,269
that

410
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:54,240
so there's multiple ways to do it using

411
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:57,778
two instruments like this would be the

412
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,120
way to do it for long term unattended

413
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:01,890
measurement if you only had a single

414
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,889
measurement that'd be the way to do it

415
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,470
if it's more of an on-the-fly

416
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:12,149
mobile measurement where it's convenient

417
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:14,038
to make the reflectance measurement the

418
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:19,250
background measurement periodically as

419
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:21,839
the sky conditions change so we actually

420
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:25,140
we actually made some measurements we're

421
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,678
still in the process of beta testing and

422
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,149
this instrument we actually made some

423
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,220
measurements in the backyard of our

424
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:36,389
facility at Apogee instruments in Logan

425
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,100
Utah just over a grass surface so our

426
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,130
configuration essentially looks like

427
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:44,308
this we have a upward facing instrument

428
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:47,610
and a downward facing instrument we use

429
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:50,009
a spectral on panel to match the

430
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:53,729
downward instrument to the upward

431
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:56,908
instrument and this gives you some some

432
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,110
sample data as I mentioned this was over

433
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:02,230
turfgrass

434
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:05,469
to make it a bit more interesting we

435
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:09,190
intentionally stopped irrigating the the

436
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:12,370
turfgrass so this is the reflectance

437
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:15,610
measurement on the last day that the

438
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:18,789
irrigation system was on and then we

439
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:21,579
turned off the water about three days

440
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:26,529
later on August 24th the reflectance

441
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:30,879
spectrum was here five days later on

442
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:32,859
August 29 it was here and then four days

443
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,250
later on September 2nd

444
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:38,349
it was here so you can see there's some

445
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,289
pretty substantial changes in the

446
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:44,349
reflectance spectrum as the grass dries

447
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:48,099
out going from well-watered to water

448
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:55,019
stress this is the kind of the kind of

449
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:58,389
data that spectra radiometers yield the

450
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:01,679
changes in for plant responses to

451
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,679
environmental change

452
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:12,099
and we can potentially learn a lot about

453
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:13,420
plants without having to sample them and

454
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,329
take them back to the lab for analysis

455
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,940
because now we have a way to to measure

456
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:21,720
the light reflectance is the function of

457
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,720
changes in the environment
