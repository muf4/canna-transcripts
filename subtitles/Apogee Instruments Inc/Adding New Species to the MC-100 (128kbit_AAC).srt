1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Ben Crabbe.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I do technical sales and support here at
Apogee Instruments.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm here to talk to you about the
process to load new coefficients onto your

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,800
[SPEAKER_00]: MC-100 chlorophyll concentration meter.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,160
[SPEAKER_00]: What inspired this process is that we have
some new coefficients for cannabis and for

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,500
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,820
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the future, as we have new species
with new coefficients, you can use the

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,240
[SPEAKER_00]: same process to access those new files,
add them onto your meter, and get the most

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,220
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate measurements you can.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,500
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process will be we go to our
website and we download the files from the

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,120
[SPEAKER_00]: MC-100 product support page.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We connect this MC-100 to the computer.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll allow us to access the folder
on this device with the files.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,400
[SPEAKER_00]: You drag the new coefficient files that
you just downloaded onto the MC-100.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,800
[SPEAKER_00]: You disconnect it.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you navigate through the menu on the
MC-100 to cannabis or grape or whatever

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,420
[SPEAKER_00]: species you please.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start taking
measurements.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's show you how to make all this
happen.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,560
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to our website,
apogeanstruments.com, www.apogeanstruments

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,320
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the Support tab up at the top and
find the chlorophyll meter page.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're on chlorophyll meter support.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here, new coefficients, you can
click on this link and this will take you

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,800
[SPEAKER_00]: down the page to the relevant spot or you
can just scroll down and get to it that

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,100
[SPEAKER_00]: way.

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,700
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the chlorophyll meter new
coefficients.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,240
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a link here.

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,380
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have instructions here that you
can follow in case my video doesn't

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,800
[SPEAKER_00]: suffice.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,480
[SPEAKER_00]: You can download the setting or the new
coefficients right here.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's open up a new Explorer window.

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,940
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to our downloads.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the new coefficients it just
downloaded.

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract them because it's a zip folder.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,080
[SPEAKER_00]: So we extract them.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can see we have two files in here.

38
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:03,220
[SPEAKER_00]: They're .tab files, some kind of encrypted
file format that works well on the MC-100

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,660
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we're gonna do is we're gonna
connect this and drag these files over.

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll quickly just move over to the
display of the meter so you can see the

42
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,800
[SPEAKER_00]: buttons I'm pushing.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,520
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our meter.

44
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,260
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll turn it on.

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there it goes.

46
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,780
[SPEAKER_00]: We plug it in with this little USB cable
that it came with the other end of which

47
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,660
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the computer.

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,740
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's plugged in.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,100
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit data and it says USB link active.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this means that it is connected
to the computer and you ought to be able

51
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,400
[SPEAKER_00]: to access the relevant folder now.

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,640
[SPEAKER_00]: So switching back over to the computer
view.

53
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,380
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll open up another Explorer window and
we can see we have an option MC-100.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So you open this up and you see a bunch of
other .tab files for all the other species

55
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,620
[SPEAKER_00]: that have coefficients already loaded onto
the meter.

56
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,380
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we're gonna do is we're gonna take
these two files and we're gonna drag them

57
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,000
[SPEAKER_00]: in.

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I already had them in there,
but we'll replace them.

59
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have cannabis and we have grape
in the meter.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,520
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do this, they may show up down at
the bottom.

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to scroll all the way to
bottom of the list when we get to this

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,080
[SPEAKER_00]: step.

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,120
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the time being, they're in there.

64
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I'm gonna switch back over to
our MC-100 display.

65
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll just hit this eject button.

66
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,040
[SPEAKER_00]: It says unplug the USB cable, okay.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,380
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're back to the usual screen,
but we expect we should have new

68
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,780
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficients on here we could select if we
want to.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,740
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get to them, we hit run.

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we hit setup.

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we hit the down arrow a couple of
times until we get to a screen that says

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,860
[SPEAKER_00]: use custom measurement.

73
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,540
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we hit edit.

74
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And this highlights this units.

75
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Says yes, I think you can make it say no,
but we want to say yes.

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,540
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it say yes and no by hitting
up and down.

77
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we have yes highlighted,
we hit the right arrow.

78
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got 27 files with different
coefficients for a different species.

79
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,520
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just scroll through until we find,
let's look for cannabis.

80
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,340
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be down at the bottom or maybe it's
in the middle of the list somewhere.

81
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,380
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cannabis, down at the bottom.

82
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last two here, we have grape and we
have cannabis.

83
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,660
[SPEAKER_00]: So excellent, let's hit accept.

84
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have cannabis coefficient selected.

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,700
[SPEAKER_00]: We can exit out of this screen and we're
ready to take measurements.

86
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,860
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just stick the leaf in there,
depress the arm, and you'll be taking

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,060
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate, absolute chlorophyll
concentration measurements of cannabis.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you selected grape, you can get them
for grape.

89
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,840
[SPEAKER_00]: As we develop coefficients for new
species, we'll put them at the same

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
[SPEAKER_00]: location on our website, that support page
for the MC-100.

91
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can follow this same procedure to
get them added onto your meter.

92
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice day.

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,860
Thank you.

95
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:17,920
Bye-bye.
