1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,448
my name is Skyler Smith and today we're

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:05,099
going to talk about the PV monitoring

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:07,588
package available from Apogee

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:10,259
instruments and this is a list of

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,480
everything included in the package

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,939
each of these sensors is available

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,399
separately for your own application we

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,480
designed this to go with an SMA cluster

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,849
controller so each of these are

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
compatible with that but for your

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,019
application you only need certain ones

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,410
feel free to contact us for availability

13
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:32,399
on that so the package includes the sp2

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,039
14 solar radiation sensor the SP 150 era

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,160
temperature sensor the TS 100 fan

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,950
aspirated shield and then the CS 240 vac

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,199
a panel temperature sensor and then

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,590
these smaller things are accessories to

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,129
help with the installation of those the

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,340
SP 214 measures your solar radiation in

21
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:56,399
watts per meter square and it comes with

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,980
a standard 5 meter cable it is a silicon

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,020
cell detector but we calibrate it to

24
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,988
match those higher-end blackbody

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,549
thermopiles secondary standards and so I

26
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,379
have a link here for the traceability

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,010
you can find that same link in the

28
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,149
comments below but what we mean by

29
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,150
calibrating to those secondary standards

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,020
is that our spectral response is from

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,780
360 to 1120 nanometers for the SP 214

32
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,239
but we calibrate it to match those

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,079
high-end secondary standards that have a

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,679
range of 285 to 2800 nanometers so that

35
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,000
means on a clear sky our SP 214 is going

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,380
to read the same as those high-end

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,659
secondary standards the SP 150 ambient

38
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,149
air temperature sensor it's a class a

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,100
PRT

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:47,100
ip67 rated come standard 5 meter cable

41
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:50,009
and it does meet that IEC standard for

42
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,219
air temperature accuracy now you can

43
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,840
just put that in a guild shield or we

44
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,649
recommend putting it into our active

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,000
radiation shield our TS 100 and you can

46
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,070
see in this picture over here on this

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,438
cross section how the SP 150 would just

48
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:07,769
slide right in there so the idea behind

49
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,299
this is it's got a fan in there to

50
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,340
circulate the air so you're getting the

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,930
highest accurate air temperature

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,150
possible

53
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,269
with that long rated fan comes with five

54
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,129
meter standard this particular 24 volt

55
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,680
step-down converter again is designed

56
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:25,048
for that SMA cluster controller that is

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,519
powered with 24 volts to step that down

58
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:30,870
to the 12 volts needed to run the fan

59
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,789
now as far as that argument between

60
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,680
guilt sealed and active radiation shield

61
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,870
we did some testing on our roofs to show

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,239
the difference and you can see the blue

63
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,799
across the top here is your passive

64
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,430
radiation shield your grill shield right

65
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:47,370
there and then the red is our TS 100

66
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,450
active radiation shield so if your goal

67
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,969
is to meet that IEC 6 172 4-1

68
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,979
specification the uncertainty says it

69
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,169
has to be plus or minus 1 degrees C and

70
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,780
that's in gray on our graph here and

71
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:04,048
each of these blue dots and red dots are

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,459
15-minute averages for measurements so

73
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,530
you can see when the Sun comes out and

74
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,539
gets between five and six hundred watts

75
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,810
per meter squared that we are actually

76
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:15,239
outside of that range with a Gil shield

77
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,459
that we're outside that 1 degree C

78
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,980
accuracy so if you want to stay within

79
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,199
that particular specification you really

80
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:26,818
need some sort of active shield that's

81
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:29,639
why we recommend the t s 100 C s 240

82
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,268
back panel temperature sensor class a

83
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,879
PRT

84
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,039
highly accurate comes in your standard

85
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,039
cable length 15 and 50 meters in length

86
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:42,598
and that it also includes that captain

87
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:44,340
tape for mounting so to recap our pv 100

88
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:47,638
monitoring package does include

89
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,169
everything on this list here the 214 the

90
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,689
solar mounting bracket with leveling

91
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:53,909
plate their temperature sensor the fan

92
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:56,189
aspirated shield the step-down converter

93
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:58,978
and then the back panel temperature

94
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,019
sensor with that captain tape so please
