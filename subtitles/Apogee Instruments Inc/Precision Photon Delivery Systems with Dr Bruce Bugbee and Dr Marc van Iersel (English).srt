00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,720
BRUCE: I'm Bruce Bugbee, President of Apogee Instruments,  and professor at Utah State University.  

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,439
We're honored today to have my colleague,  my long-term colleague, Marc van Iersel, 

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:20,800
here with us at the Apogee recording studio, both  to visit at my laboratory at the university to  

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,359
talk about science, but also to talk about  commercial implications of all that science.

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,519
Marc and I have been colleagues for  many, many years, many decades even,  

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,799
and we've shared students back and forth. It's  been a wonderful collaboration. The thing we  

7
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:49,519
want to talk about today is exemplified here on  the board, what we call precision photon delivery.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,200
So now that we live in an era with LEDs,  wow they give us unprecedented ability  

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,719
to control the delivery of photons, and not  just focused photons, but changes in timing  

10
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,599
of the photon delivery. So in this case, when we  say precision delivery, today we're going  

11
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:18,959
to mostly talk about precision delivery in time  of these photons. So Marc, do you want to start by  

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,040
how your university research has informed this  and how has that led to your--Marc has a company  

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,760
called Candidus that makes software and hardware  to achieve precision photon delivery. So he's right  

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,439
in the middle of all of this, but do you want  to comment on how your university research has  

15
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,879
informed all this? MARC: Yeah, absolutely, and thank you  for having me today, Bruce. So I started working on  

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,160
lighting research about eight years  ago. And when I decided to do so, what I 

17
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,519
identified as a niche that nobody else seemed to  be paying attention to was how can we actually  

18
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:10,240
control LED light fixtures very precisely to give  plants the amount of light that they need at the time  

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,080
that they need it and can use it most efficiently. So that's how we started out, since then we have  

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,360
gotten a big USDA grant, where we are collaborating  with Bruce's Utah State University lab, but we're  

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,880
also collaborating with fantastic electrical  engineers and people in energy informatics  

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
who have helped me see the bigger picture  of how you can actually do this. How you can  

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,599
optimize lighting and how this can impact  society at large, which ultimately makes all  

24
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,280
of this work much more exciting. So it's been a  fascinating evolution over the past eight years,  

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,319
where I've learned lots of things from working  with lots of people who know things that I do not.

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,880
BRUCE: Just to elaborate on that  for our for the listeners, it's 

27
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:05,759
probably close to five years ago now we've  collaborated on a large grant to the USDA

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:15,280
to look at optimizing lighting. And this LAMP--this project came to be called the LAMP

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,599
project--and I think you're the one  that coined that phrase L-A-M-P  

30
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:28,000
Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits. And,  of course, the USDA is very interested in

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,599
optimizing this and the whole thing  is lighting approaches. So now with  

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,319
USDA funds and collaboration of multiple  laboratories, we've done a lot with this.  

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,319
MARC: Yeah it's been a great project. It's  not just plant scientists that are involved.  

34
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
So I think the key word, actually, in the title of  the project is "profits," and when we think profits,  

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,520
we have to think economics, right? Because Bruce and  I typically really tend to focus on the plants: how  

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,439
do we grow plants? And that's really fascinating  stuff, but if we don't take into account the cost  

37
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,439
associated with that, then ultimately we're not  serving the controlled environment agriculture  

38
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,000
industry--plant factories and greenhouses--in the way that we need to, because yes, they  

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,319
need to grow plants, but more than that what  they have to do is be as profitable as 

40
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,599
they can be. And that has really required  this interdisciplinary work to get these  

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,960
different perspectives on how we can do things  beyond just plant science and horticulture.

42
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,959
BRUCE: Yeah, in this grant we all joke, because the currency  for us as professors is a bunch of referee journal  

43
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:47,279
articles, which as you know can be pretty egghead  journal articles. And the USDA doesn't want to see  

44
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,159
a bunch of egghead referee journal articles,  they want to see boots on the ground.

45
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,160
They want to see how all of this work is  going to help growers. MARC: Yeah, and that is actually  

46
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,399
where my company can also play an important role.  So as academics, we can develop all these methods.

47
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:11,120
We try them on a relatively small scale, but as  academics we have relatively little incentive  

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,079
from our institutions to try to make sure that  these new technologies actually get implemented  

49
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,079
at scale throughout the industry. So at  Candidus, we are very focused, of course,

50
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,599
in making sure that we get this technology into  commercial facilities. And we have an additional  

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,879
project with a different branch of the USDA, the  National Resources Conservation Service,  

52
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:42,000
where Candidus works with them on not just  showing that we can achieve significant energy  

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,720
reductions through better lighting control methods,  but what we really are focused on there in the  

54
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,000
long term is to develop guidelines to invent incentive or rebate programs  

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,720
for the industry to help them get this technology  into their greenhouses. And so I think that is a  

56
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,560
really exciting long-term thing, because those  incentive programs are going to really help make  

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,480
this technology accessible. And certain utility  companies, especially in the northeast of the U.S.,  

58
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,240
are already providing rebates, not just for better  lights, but for better lighting control  

59
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,000
systems. So we really see this movement happening,  and that's a great impact of project LAMP.

60
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:34,959
BRUCE: And I think most people know now that every  passing year there are fewer and fewer high  

61
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:43,839
pressure sodium lamps used and more and more LEDs  used, as the LEDs get both more reliable and more  

62
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,799
cost effective. And, of course, it's a nice  synergism between us, because, first-of-all,  

63
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,160
you've got to precisely measure the photons and  then you use the software to figure out how to  

64
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,200
deliver the photons. MARC: Yeah, and the change from high  pressure sodium fixtures to LED fixtures 

65
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,680
is really important when you think about  controlling lighting. With high pressure sodium  

66
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,079
maybe you have some ability to dim them, depending  on what fixtures you're using, but once they take  

67
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,560
some time to heat up and give you full light  output. Once you turn them off, they need time  

68
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,040
to cool down before you can turn them back on. So  you can't get real precise control over how much  

69
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,319
supplemental light you're providing in a  greenhouse. With LED fixtures, almost all of those  

70
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,519
are fully dimmable at this point in time.  And  their mobility allows us to very precisely control  

71
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:46,639
exactly how much supplemental light we provide  in response to how much sunlight is available at  

72
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:54,000
that particular point in time. So LEDs have really  opened up a whole new area to make this lighting  

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
control much more beneficial for the industry. BRUCE: Yeah,  all of us at our research greenhouses were pushing  

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,759
the envelope with high pressure sodium trying to  cycle them faster to get this variable control,  

75
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,319
and we burned up a lot of capacitors and a lot of  high pressure sodium lights trying to push them  

76
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,839
to the edge. And that was expensive  having to rebuild these lights all the time.  

77
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,560
This is something that people don't  think about much with LEDs. They think, "Okay,  

78
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,320
great, they're more efficient, but man, they're  so much more controllable." We're just on the  

79
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,600
threshold of taking advantage of that. MARC: Yeah, I  really think that it is the next frontier and  

80
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,360
when I would talk to the industry about this  topic two or three years ago, people would go,  

81
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,600
"That's pretty interesting, I never thought about  this." But I was at a trade show just two months ago, 

82
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,440
and it's really satisfying to see that we have to  explain much less what we're doing, because people  

83
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,480
are getting the concept. And I think when it comes  to lighting, control of how many photons we deliver  

84
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,840
when is really the next frontier. LED fixtures  are great, but they're starting to push to the  

85
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,240
theoretical limit of how good they can be. And  advances in the efficacy of LED fixtures, they're  

86
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,080
going to slow down, but we can still make big  improvements on actually how we use those fixtures  

87
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,560
in commercial facilities, and  the research facilities, as well.  

88
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:32,080
BRUCE: An analogy, I guess as teachers were always trying  to think of analogies that help explain things, but an  

89
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,320
analogy for me is being like a high performance  athlete where when you eat and what you eat  

90
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,200
makes a big difference in your performance. And  here with the HPS, well, you can  

91
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,640
have a steak dinner or not a steak dinner. And  now we could have almost the equivalent of like  

92
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,759
precision intravenous feeding to deliver  the photons at just the right time for maximum  

93
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,679
performance. MARC: Yeah, and that's absolutely correct. There are really good quantum sensors available,  

94
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,120
of course, including from Apogee. That information  is really critical, but you can interface those  

95
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,560
with really cheap microcomputers that can take  those readings, apply really advanced algorithms  

96
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,159
to that real-time data that feeds in, and then  those microcomputers can send a signal back to  

97
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:28,639
the light fixtures and tell those light fixtures  exactly what they need to do. And at Candidus,

98
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,919
we tell light fixtures every 15 seconds what change  we want to make to make sure that by the end of  

99
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:40,959
the day, or by the end of the growing cycle, that  crop has received just enough light to grow exactly  

100
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,800
how it needs to grow, but without  providing more light than is really required. 

101
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,960
And that excess light that is often provided in  greenhouses is really expensive. And in some cases, 

102
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,120
I think that can make the difference between a  greenhouse being profitable versus losing money.  

103
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,879
And so we really want to push those  facilities towards profitability.  

104
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,840
BRUCE: It's pretty intuitive on a partly cloudy day.  When the sun comes out you can turn your lights  

105
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,480
down because you get sunlight, but five minutes  later the sun goes behind a cloud and now you need to  

106
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,680
turn them back up. And, of course, this is what we're  talking about--that level of controllability.  

107
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,320
First-of-all, Marc just gave an invited  talk at a controlled environments conference.  

108
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,360
It was a conference in Tucson that we both  were at. But he gave a talk about this and  

109
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,559
I wonder if you could elaborate a  bit more on the variable price of electricity  

110
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:53,919
and how that enters into this. MARC: Yeah, I think that  is a really fascinating topic. And the reason  

111
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,240
that we are working on this topic at the  University of Georgia is because I have  

112
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,120
colleagues in engineering and energy informatics  who understand these things much better  

113
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,799
than I do. But it seems pretty intuitive that  if you have variable electricity prices over  

114
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,519
the course of a day, you want to provide  as much supplemental light as possible  

115
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,439
during times of the day that that  electricity is relatively cheap.  

116
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,839
And so my colleagues in engineering have  developed algorithms that can take advantage  

117
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,759
of that variable electricity price. And now the  goal is no longer to minimize the amount of  

118
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,058
supplemental light that we provide to meet a crop's need, and that's what I did in the past.

119
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,080
We are now able to actually control lights  based on how can we minimize the cost of that  

120
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,200
electricity. And, of course, when you think about  that from a commercial perspective, that is really  

121
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,040
what they need to do. And so we have developed  algorithms that can do this really well and  

122
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:01,839
those algorithms reduce the cost of electricity  use by about 35% over less sophisticated  

123
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,960
methods that are actually probably still better  than what is commonly used in the industry.

124
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,040
Likewise, at Candidus we have done a number  of trials in commercial greenhouses with our  

125
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:21,199
proprietary lighting control approach. And we  typically reduce electricity use by about 30%  

126
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,000
without a notable impact on the crop--  the plants grow just as well. But that is a lot  

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,840
of money that you end up saving because the cost  of providing supplemental light in the greenhouse  

128
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:43,199
can easily be $60,000, $70,000 per acre over a lettuce growing cycle. So  

129
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,080
if you can cut that by about a third, that's.  in my book. quite a bit of money. BRUCE: Yeah.

130
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,440
Not everybody understands the issues of variable  electricity pricing, other than we know

131
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,160
they often vary. But when a utility company  gets the infrastructure to provide electricity,  

132
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,000
if you if they don't use it, it's hard to store  electricity. And so they end up purchasing  

133
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
electricity that they can't use certain times  of the day and they would love to have customers  

134
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,480
use that surplus electricity. And then the  opposite, the common thing is late in the afternoon  

135
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,039
everybody's air conditioners come on and now  the cost of electricity is just enormous. Well,

136
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,959
we could just turn the lights off during those  periods of peak demand. So this interface between  

137
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,960
big greenhouse growers and utility companies has  a lot of potential to help the utility companies  

138
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:55,920
efficiently utilize their capacity. MARC: Yeah,  and what we have actually seen in the past weeks  

139
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,919
in the United States is that people in California  have been asked to turn up their air conditioning  

140
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:09,120
units or turn up the ac to maybe 78 degrees. Texas has massive problems with the  

141
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,840
utility network not being able to provide enough  power for all of their customers during peak times.  

142
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,399
And so, actually, at Candidus we have collaborated  quite a bit with utility companies to try to help  

143
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:30,240
them shift the electricity-using greenhouses  away from those peak hours. And this is a really  

144
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,879
important topic for utility companies and that's  why i think ultimately we need to get the control  

145
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:43,120
environment ag industry hooked up with the utility  industry, so that we can come up with solutions  

146
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,840
that are actually beneficial for everybody. And  then hopefully we can have a positive impact  

147
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,320
on society, as well. So we're really focused  on creating a win-win-win scenario there. 

148
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,960
BRUCE: So if you tell people, "Just suffer. Turn your AC up,"  they're not very happy about that. But  

149
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,480
we don't usually consider if the plants get happy  or sad. If we just tell them we're going to give  

150
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,600
you the photons a little later, the plants grow  just as well. And that's the issue here.

151
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,159
MARC: That's actually an interesting topic  because the conventional wisdom and what we  

152
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:24,240
tend to do in controlled environment agriculture is  we want to control everything really precisely.  

153
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,960
I think those of us who are working in controlled  environment agriculture we tend to be, as I like  

154
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,360
to say, control freaks. But we've actually done  quite a bit of research at the university that  

155
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,519
has shown that plants actually don't really care  about that precision control. They're perfectly  

156
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,360
happy if you give them more light now, less light,  later maybe more light today, less light tomorrow.  

157
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,600
And that, first-of-all, was really surprising  to us, but it was also really exciting  

158
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,680
because that now allows us to really take  advantage of time periods that electricity  

159
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:07,359
is relatively cheap. And it's provided a whole  new frontier for this precision photon delivery,  

160
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:14,079
because we don't have to keep the light levels  in the greenhouse as stable as we possibly can.

161
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:22,480
So that can be really beneficial for the industry.  BRUCE: So just to switch topics a little bit, I want to  

162
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,519
ask you about how did you choose the name Candidus for your company? People ask me how did you choose  

163
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,480
Apogee? Well, it's the point in an orbit farthest  from the earth, and I was doing a lot of work with  

164
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,839
NASA, so that was kind of a no-brainer, but  Candidus, that's an unusual name. How did you  

165
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:46,000
come up with that? MARC: It's kind of an interesting and  maybe funny story. So my co-founder, Erico Mattos,  

166
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,920
asked me if I was willing to co-found a company  with him to work on lighting control systems. And  

167
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,680
I said, "Yes, I'd be excited to work on  that." And, of course, the very first thing we  

168
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,960
needed to do was figure out, well, what is the name  of that company going to be? So I spent an evening  

169
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,799
on the internet and I was interested in either  Greek or Latin words that had some connection  

170
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,200
to light, because our focus, of course, is on  light. And so I found all kinds of terms, but  

171
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,160
most of those were already in use by lots of other  companies. And I finally came across Candidus,  

172
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:31,200
and one of the meanings in Latin is "light," but  another meaning that pushed it over the edge is  

173
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,920
"grey-haired." And I said, "That's it! That's what we're  going with!" I sent an email to Erico. I explained it.

174
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,880
He laughed and agreed, and here we are. BRUCE: Here we go.  MARC: So I'm the official spokesperson for the company.  

175
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:59,440
BRUCE: Wise elders helping you better utilize your  photons. Well, Marc, it's been a great great run that  

176
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:07,759
we've had back and forth over the years and it's  so exciting to be working in an area that  

177
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:16,159
has both lots of opportunities, profound scientific  discoveries, but the commercial opportunities, too.  

178
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,120
They're very synergistic for both of us.  

179
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,200
MARC: Yeah, as you well know, it's really exciting if  you can take the work that you do at a university  

180
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,319
and through a company really help to to scale  the work that we do in an academic setting. And  

181
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,960
there are lots of things in my career that have  been rewarding. Perhaps the most important thing is  

182
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,519
all the people that I've worked with, the graduate  students that I have trained. But I think now  

183
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:50,240
seeing this technology spread through the industry, that is really rewarding in a different way  

184
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,359
because I can tell that we're making a positive  impact. Not just on the industry, but I think we're  

185
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:01,759
having a positive impact on society, too. So  it's really exciting to be involved. BRUCE: This meeting--  

186
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:09,039
it was just last week that we were together in  Tucson. It's a controlled environments conference.  

187
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,240
And when that first started long time ago back,  when we were much younger, it was a bunch of  

188
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,920
academics sitting around a small table discussing  science. And that was the whole meeting. And as the  

189
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:32,559
basic science found application, commercial people  started to want to come to the meeting. And sure,  

190
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,679
come to the meeting. And the group grew, and it grew,  and it grew. And the growth chamber people come,  

191
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,680
lots of LED people come to this, instrument  companies come to this meeting now. And so  

192
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:52,160
now we had over 200 people at our last meeting,  which started out with a bunch of egghead people  

193
00:20:53,359 --> 00:21:01,359
discussing some pretty refined points of science.  It's just a remarkable transformation. MARC: Yeah, well, as  

194
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,719
you commented on during that meeting, well  you've probably been part of it for about 30  

195
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,400
maybe a little bit longer years. BRUCE: Yeah, over 30, yeah. MARC: And controlled environment was really just a  

196
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,120
research tool, where we could do research that then  might or might not have practical applications. A  

197
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:25,039
lot of it was pretty basic research that was done  in growth chambers basically, but maybe nothing  

198
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:32,000
about controlled environment. That is a very large  controlled environment agriculture industry. We  

199
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,680
have a number of large vertical farms and they  keep growing. And on the greenhouse side, the  

200
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:46,640
greenhouse vegetable industry is just exploding.   So, I think that is at least to some extent really  

201
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:53,839
a long-term result of the work that people like  you were doing 30 years ago already. And now we see  

202
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,920
a real transformation of how we actually grow  vegetables. BRUCE: The earliest stuff was mostly NASA  

203
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,480
funded. We got NASA funding and NASA can't  really have a greenhouse on the moon or  

204
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,319
Mars. There's no atmosphere. It has to be pressurized  or meteorites would break it. NASA has  

205
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:21,519
to use electric lights in a closed system. And  those are the early days, but boy, as soon  

206
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:28,319
as LEDs came along, it just exploded for commercial opportunities. MARC: Now, though, I remember  

207
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,960
some of the first thoughts at this very meeting  about growing plants under LEDs and it was really  

208
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,799
interesting. You saw beautiful pictures, but only  NASA could actually afford to buy LEDs because  

209
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:45,919
they were so expensive, and, quite frankly, they  were very, very bad compared to what we have now.  

210
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,880
And for a long time I was not convinced that  this would be something that would ever become  

211
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,960
commercially viable. But, of course, by now  it has completely changed and LEDs are  

212
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,279
really efficient. There's probably never going to be  a different kind of light that is going to come  

213
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:09,440
along that is going to replace LEDs, because  LEDs are so good and they will be the choice  

214
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:18,079
for growing plants, whether it's indoors or in  greenhouses. BRUCE: Well, we both talk about this  

215
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,599
all the time, but if we look at the history of  electric lighting, if we go back far enough it  

216
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,919
was monks with kerosene lamps walking from room  to room. What's the energy efficiency of that? It's  

217
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,279
teeny, it's tenths of a percent turning  energy into light. And then Edison invents the  

218
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:43,839
incandescent bulb and it's a huge breakthrough,  and we got up to like 5% efficiency. 

219
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,839
And at the time, massive breakthrough. Then  after World War II we went to fluorescence  

220
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:59,279
and we got into the 15% efficiency with fluorescent  lights--another big breakthrough. Then we went to  

221
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:05,119
high intensity discharge--high pressure sodium. Another big breakthrough, we got into the 30%  

222
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,920
efficiency of electric lighting and we thought, "Oh my, this is incredible!" Guess what? Now we are at  

223
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:20,080
LEDs that are 80% efficient. That's why it's  the end of the road. You can't get past 100 and the  

224
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:26,960
LEDs are going to creep up toward 100. It's  just amazing. MARC: Yeah, theoretically LEDs can become  

225
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,440
100 efficient. I will never get to 100, but at some  point we'll be at 95 efficiency. And that's why I  

226
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,920
think it's pretty easy to predict that there's  not going to be something else that comes along  

227
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,240
that is going to be even better than LEDs. BRUCE: Yeah,  we talk a lot about the light to heat ratios of  

228
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:53,440
things and light is good, heat is bad. Then LEDs, interestingly enough, when you calculate the  

229
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:02,880
light to heat ratio of sunlight--the energy in  the photons versus the total energy of the sun--  

230
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:11,039
you get about two micromoles per joule from the  sunlight. And this is the photosynthetic photon  

231
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:19,519
flux divided by total energy. And LEDs, now, we're  past three micromoles per joule. It's amazing.  

232
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:26,319
LEDs have caught up and passed the sun for  efficiency. MARC: That's the fun stat. I've never really  

233
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,200
thought about the efficiency of the sun, but that  makes sense and it is a really good indication  

234
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,160
of how good these LEDs are now. And then the other  exciting thing, of course, is that with these LEDs,  

235
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,279
unlike the high intensity discharge lights, we  can get that precision control. That was never  

236
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:49,200
going to be possible with HID lights, so it's not  just the efficiency, it's also the controllability  

237
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,279
of these LED fixtures that is going to be  really beneficial. When you think about commercial  

238
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,240
buildings, in many cases, those lights are already  dimming automatically in response to how much  

239
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,680
light is coming into the building. You don't notice  it because it is gradual and your eyes adjust to  

240
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:13,680
it, but it is one other way in which we can use  these LEDs to be really energy efficient. BRUCE: Yup, well,  

241
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,840
that's why we wanted to have this discussion about  precision timing of delivery, because when people  

242
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,879
think about LEDs they're all about, "Okay, what's  the optimum spectra and what color should I use?"  

243
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,879
That's a huge subject, which we've  talked about many times. But in addition to  

244
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,160
that, there's this timing of delivery, which  is great. It's a new frontier. 

245
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,279
MARC: And I think that's going to be the next big  advance in lighting control--in controlled  

246
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,879
environment agriculture. And it is really  important. You think about it, it's obvious  

247
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,600
in greenhouses where you have the sunlight that is  constantly changing. When you think about a plant  

248
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:59,919
factory where the cost of electricity is an even  bigger part of the overall production cost, right?  

249
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,880
If they can respond to those real-time  pricing changes that are happening, they  

250
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,480
could substantially reduce electricity cost. That  is going to require collaboration, I think, between  

251
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,360
utility companies and those plant factories,  because, I think, utility companies are going  

252
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:23,279
to have to provide incentives for vertical  farming companies to implement some of that  

253
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,960
better approach that can help the utility  companies in a big time. BRUCE: Yeah, you know one of the  

254
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,840
things that comes to mind for greenhouses, as you  mentioned recently. If you run your lights late at  

255
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:43,599
night, people complain about the light pollution.  Well, so shift it. So, let's turn them on early  

256
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:49,039
in the morning and off earlier. Then people don't  complain about light pollution if the lights come  

257
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,200
on at 4 AM. But boy, if they don't go off  till 10 PM, there's a lot of heartburn about that. 

258
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,240
So shift it. The plants are fine doing something simple like that. 

259
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,559
MARC: Yeah, it's simple for a greenhouse to just shift that light . It actually creates some interesting challenges  

260
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,720
from a control perspective, because if we provide  a lot of light later in the day, we have already  

261
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,000
measured how much sunlight that greenhouse got  during the day. And so we know exactly how much  

262
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,559
more light we need to provide during that evening.  The challenge is, if we provide light early in the  

263
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,879
morning, we don't know how much light those  plants are going to get later in the day.  

264
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,880
And so another thing that we need to incorporate,  I think, in these lighting control algorithms is  

265
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,119
forecast of how much solar radiation, or how much  light, is going to be available during the day. And  

266
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,879
then we can start taking that into account at 3AM  when there is no sunlight yet. And luckily enough,  

267
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,800
those forecasts are readily available because the  photovoltaic, or solar energy, industry is heavily  

268
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,319
dependent on those forecasts, so that can simply be  purchased from a variety of companies. That's  

269
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,039
the next thing that we want to look at. BRUCE: Yeah. Yeah,  though that's a really good point. As we do more  

270
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,480
solar PV, this forecasting it's super important  for them, too, to match supply with demand.  

271
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,879
MARC: We're just lucky that that industry is so dependent on  that forecasting, because if it was just the  

272
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,240
greenhouse industry, I don't think anyone would  bother actually developing these forecasts.  

273
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,920
BRUCE: Yeah. MARC: But they're readily available  and we can take advantage of them.  

274
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:35,199
BRUCE:, Well, thanks. This has been a great discussion. As  we always say, stay tuned! This is a evolving thing.  

275
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,840
We keep getting new research data. Things change. 

276
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,000
We're always looking for ways to explain the basic  science and find ways to use the basic science to  

277
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,879
commercialize it and help a lot of  people. MARC: Well, thank you, Bruce, for having me  

278
00:29:52,880 --> 00:30:00,601
and thank you for watching our conversation  today. BRUCE: Stay tuned, we'll be in touch. Bye, now.
