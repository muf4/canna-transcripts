00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,940
This is the user guide for the Apogee Guardian.

00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:13,254
[Music]

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,254
The Apogee Guardian is an all-in-one  Greenhouse monitor.

4
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:21,488
The Guardian features five different sensors providing nine different metrics,

5
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,688
and gives you the option to access them using one app.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,080
The Apogee Guardian comes in two different  models the SM-500, which features a PAR sensor,  

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,820
and the SM-600, which features an ePAR sensor.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,562
The entire shroud is an aspirated shield for the  temperature sensor which you can see at the bottom.

9
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:45,947
The Guardian will take air and pull it up through the housing past the temperature sensor. 

10
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,176
and then disperse that air out the top the top.  

11
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:55,380
The bottom of the Guardian is held on by magnets and when  removed we'll give you access to the humidity,  

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,835
the CO2, and the pressure sensors.

13
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:05,284
To put the bottom back on, line it up, and should snap right back on because it's held on by magnets.

14
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:09,551
Keep in mind the Guardian is waterproof from falling rain.

15
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,551
You don't want to spray water up into the unit,

16
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,817
because it could damage the components of the Guardian.

17
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:20,843
Inside the Guardian case it comes with a wire hanging kit.

18
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:25,712
and a power adapter.

19
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:29,570
To power on the Guardian,  pull the connector from the housing.

20
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,117
Line up the pins.

21
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:33,015
Connect the connector,

22
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,849
and finger tighten the metal rings.

23
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,730
Then, add power.

24
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:48,304
Make sure that when you power on the Guardian the  bottom is free and clear from any obstructions.

25
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:53,525
That way the air can freely flow through  the device and it won't over stress the fan .

26
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:57,138
The Guardian is powered on  but is not collecting any data.

27
00:01:57,138 --> 00:02:00,728
To take data, you need to either use the Modbus protocol,

28
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:03,102
or use the Bluetooth Apogee Connect app.

29
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:09,126
To use the wire hanging kit,  first locate the wire kit hanging connection points .

30
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:10,825
There are three of them.

31
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,930
Take the clip, line it up from the bottom,

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,210
and push up.

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,855
It'll make a popping sound as it connects into place.

34
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,020
Do that for all three sides.

35
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:23,268
It should look something like this when you're done.

36
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:24,669
You can hang it from the hook,

37
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:28,003
or loop and then connect to the hanging kit itself.

38
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:31,710
To remove the hanging kit, pull the clips outward.

39
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:35,413
They should pop right off.

40
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:39,561
Available for the Guardian is the multi-position mast mount.

41
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:44,331
The mast mount features a u-bolt that allows  you to mount to various sizes of mast.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,174
First,

43
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:48,897
Tighten the u-bolt onto the mast mount.

44
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:52,716
Orient the clip so that the Bubble Level is facing up.

45
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:56,926
Rotate the knob clockwise to increase tension.

46
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:04,205
When you found the appropriate tension,  pull the connector away from the Guardian,  

47
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:07,812
and hook on the mount.

48
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,314
Push the top clip down to lock it into place.

49
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:19,570
Use the bubble level on top to orient  the Guardian in a horizontal position. 

50
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,918
Simply connect power and you're ready to go.

51
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:24,451
To remove the Guardian from the mast mount,

52
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:28,824
take the clip on the back side,  push towards the Guardian and up.

53
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:34,119
The retaining clip on the top should lift. At this point you can lift and pull away the Guardian.  

54
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:39,219
With the Guardian mounted and powered on you're  ready to begin taking measurements.

55
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:46,635
To use the Modbus protocol look at the user manual below  in the description for details on how to set  up using Modbus.

56
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,299
Right now I'm going to show you  how to use the Apogee Connect app.

57
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,302
First, you need to install The Apogee Connect app.

58
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:56,847
You can get the Connect app at the iTunes Store  or at the Google Play Store.

59
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:59,804
When you open the software it'll look similar to this.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,348
Mine has several sensors already connected.

61
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:03,947
Yours will probably be blank.

62
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:08,149
To add a sensor go to the plus sign up in the top left corner.

63
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,783
It will begin searching for devices .

64
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,219
Find the device and click on it.

65
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:21,670
When it's connected you can  then change the name of that device.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,216
We're going to change this to "SM 500 demo."

67
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,596
Then hit add.

68
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:35,420
When it's added you can scroll down  and see that it's connected.

69
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:40,961
If you want disconnect the device press and hold and swipe from the right .

70
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,879
It'll give the option to forget or to disconnect.

71
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:46,769
If you want to realign where your sensors are on the list,

72
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,640
Press and hold and you can slide them up and down.

73
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:54,480
On the home screen it'll give you a quick overview  of the device's measurements.

74
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,593
Let's look at those measurements in detail.

75
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:57,995
Click on the device.

76
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:05,396
From here it'll show you the readings as  well as what logs are available to collect .

77
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:11,677
If this is your first time setting up the device  click on the settings icon to set up your device.

78
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:20,359
From here you can either set up custom  calibrations dark offsets and enable logging.

79
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,787
We want to make sure we  do that so click on little toggle.

80
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:29,935
From here you can set how often you want to take  your samples and how often you want them to be logged.

81
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:37,807
We're going to change our sampling interval  to every 10 seconds and then log them every minute.

82
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:41,927
When you're done press the save button.

83
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,650
The device is now logging data.

84
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:52,639
Below you'll see the notify when full option.

85
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,705
Enable this if you'd like to receive a notification when  the memory on the Guardian is almost full.

86
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,110
After some time there'll be some data available.

87
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,475
To collect that data press the collect logs button.

88
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:11,307
From here you have the option to create a  new data set or to add to an old data set.

89
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:13,201
We're going to create a new data set.

90
00:06:14,221 --> 00:06:16,079
We're going to call it "data set demo."

91
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,980
Click in the bottom right corner under collect logs.

92
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,353
It will begin to download that data.

93
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:28,218
Depending on how much data you have to collect  it may take a minute.

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,708
Once you've collected that data you can scroll down  to see those metrics displayed in graph form.

95
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:38,610
You can see things like: the DLI photoperiods,

96
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:44,116
PAR, temperature, all the metrics that the  Guardian measures will be there in displayed form.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,274
On the icons below you have the option to switch your data set  export your data set  and delete data sets.

98
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,186
This also has the option  for a live meter mode.

99
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,076
Click on the live meter.

100
00:06:56,851 --> 00:07:00,733
It will instantly begin to show you real-time  data of what the Guardian is collecting.

101
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:04,616
As it takes samples it will begin  to display in graph form.

102
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:10,035
With that you should have what you need  to get started with a Guardian.

103
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:13,942
If you have  any questions please feel free to leave a comment  in the comment section below,
