00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments  and professor of Crop Physiology at Utah State  

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,880
University. Today we're going to talk about  new sensors from Apogee and particularly  

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:25,119
an extended range quantum sensor. We call that  an ePAR sensor. I'm first going to show you  

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,840
the sensors and the model numbers,  and then I'm going to go through  

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,719
why Apogee developed these sensors. It  comes from new research on the effects  

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,839
of spectra on photosynthesis. So let's  take a look at these sensors here.  

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:55,039
These are extended photon flux density,  and the new one we call ePAR. Now these are  

8
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:07,519
similar price, but look what happens. Let's take  this... let's put the pen on green here... First  

9
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:14,959
of all, photosynthesis, we say it starts at  400 nm, it stops at 700 nm, and it's equal  

10
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:24,479
in between. So this area right in here is classic  photosynthetic radiation. We've used that for a  

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:36,000
half a century since the days of Keith McCree's  pioneering work. This is called PPFD. I know I  

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,039
just wrote over that but photosynthetic photon  flux density. Okay and this is the classic Apogee  

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,840
sensor. This sensor is a big seller for Apogee.  And this one... let me put it under here... model  

14
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,079
SQ-500. That's the classic sensor that  measures this radiation that I just  

15
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,680
drew in here. So why do we have other  sensors if that's the classic sensor?  

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,000
There are emerging definitions of photosynthetic  radiation that I'm going to talk about.  

17
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,359
First of all, as most people know, here it  is right here — UV radiation right here.  

18
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,960
This has some photosynthetic effects. Not  many but some. I'll talk about them. This  

19
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:42,000
radiation out here is far-red. After 700 nm.  This has significant photosynthetic effects.  

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
And I'm going to talk about those  in detail in the next few minutes,  

21
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,120
which is why we've developed sensors  to do this. Now this radiation out here  

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,039
is called extended PFD and Apogee has sold that  sensor now for about a year. It goes all the way  

23
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:10,560
out to 1000 nanometers, and LED lights don't  have any radiation out here, so it doesn't  

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,280
measure them. Sunlight has lots of radiation  so you can't use that sensor in sunlight. The  

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:27,759
breakthrough is Apogee developed a cutoff filter  to cut this off right here, about 750 nanometers,  

26
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:36,879
so that it now gets... and now we've got to show  that in red because it's far red... it now gets  

27
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:47,120
this amount of radiation in here. This is a big  deal because there is a far-red LED that many  

28
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,159
manufacturers — most even — are adding to their  lights, and the classic sensor doesn't catch those  

29
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,799
photons. It doesn't show them at all, and they  cause photosynthesis. So with this new sensor,  

30
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:10,079
which you know we're working on catchy titles.  So this is extended, lowercase "e", extended PAR  

31
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,480
model, SQ-610. That's the one that  captures this extra radiation out here.  

32
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:32,479
There is another Apogee sensor... I'll show  this first... that we call the PAR — for  

33
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:41,840
photosynthetic radiation right here — and the  FAR — for the far-red radiation right here.  

34
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:51,039
This sensor has two detectors in it, and it  measures these separately. It measures the classic  

35
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,720
PPFD... I'm going to write that up  here... classic photosynthetic photon  

36
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:06,879
flux density... and it also measures the far-red.  Now this sensor of course can add those two  

37
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:16,399
numbers together to give you a total, but it  does them separately. This is a terrific sensor.  

38
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,759
Way cheaper than a spectroradiometer, and it  separately measures these two types of radiation.  

39
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,800
It is about 25% more money than the other  sensors. So save up. You could buy the classic or  

40
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,680
right now... we'll go back... you could buy either  of these for a little bit more. And they're simple  

41
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:47,759
to use — a single number. Now these are the  sensors. What we call an instrument means a  

42
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,439
sensor connected to a meter. And now I'm going to  review the two types of meters that Apogee sells  

43
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,040
because it's a package. For many many years,  Apogee has sold this classic meter. There's the  

44
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,000
on bottom right there. Couldn't be simpler  to use. You grab it. You push "on" button.  

45
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,240
This one does record, but it's  not very elegant for recording.  

46
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,120
It's mostly people use it for instantaneous  measurements. And MQ means meter quantum. So  

47
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,199
there's the meter quantum with 610, and the meter  quantum with 620. That's the classic package.  

48
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:40,319
To make the jump to light speed with this,  about a year ago Apogee introduced a µCache with  

49
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:52,560
Bluetooth. So now the same sensors plug into this  and it records data for a long time, over a year,  

50
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,840
but it also displays the data  to your phone with the Apogee  

51
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:05,920
app that comes with it. When we go to the lab, I'm  old school right? We're just going to make a quick  

52
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,040
measurement. I grab this meter because it has one  "on" button. My students laugh at me. They say  

53
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,080
"Get with the program. Just get your phone out,  and look at all the data you can collect so fast."  

54
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,800
All the students, if this meter is sitting on the  counter they say, "Where's the µCache? That's the  

55
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
one I want to use. That has more data." They can  put that in a growth chamber, close the door,  

56
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,600
and measure what's going on inside. For me, I  could run the cable through the door, and it's  

57
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:40,560
a mess. So this is an up-and-coming instrument  because of the ability to record. It shows both  

58
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,560
instantaneous and long-term. There's the picture.  I have one here. A little µCache. I didn't plan to  

59
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,399
show it with my phone, but there's some of  the histograms. Here's the PAR-FAR sensor. And  

60
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:04,719
here's the new UV-A sensor in a silver housing.  You can tell the sensors apart because of their  

61
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:15,519
distinctive colors. All right. This is the end of  the section on the new sensors. Let's just review  

62
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:25,839
this because now I'm going to go into why it's  important to measure these. So just to review,  

63
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:34,559
the old classic is extended. It gets this  radiation out in here. The improvement that really  

64
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:47,119
is this ePAR sensor, model 610. Then we go to the  next one. The PAR-FAR sensor. So red and far-red  

65
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,840
separately. If you can afford it, this is a great  sensor. But this one doesn't work with a meter by  

66
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,120
the way. It's got two outputs. So a single  meter, you have to use this with the µCache.  

67
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,840
And then there's the options for the  meters. Okay now we want to talk about  

68
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:15,039
why we want to measure these different types of  radiation. This is a much longer part of this  

69
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,559
talk, but you can skip around in  the video to the parts you want.  

70
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,919
I like to call this “Towards an optimal spectral  quality for plant growth and development.”  

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,520
And this is the name of textbooks. But when we  say plant growth, we really mean direct effects on  

72
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,559
photosynthesis. The dry weight of the plant gets  bigger. When we say development, we mean plant  

73
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:48,479
shape. The plant: tall, spindly, short, fat.  We can manipulate shape with quality of light,  

74
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:56,159
and we want to know how the quality of light  affects photosynthesis. Plants sometimes get big  

75
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,879
because we change their leaf shape. If we  can make a bigger leaf with light quality,  

76
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,120
it captures more light, and the photosynthesis  per unit leaf area is really the same.  

77
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,519
So this is a tricky thing — and I keep coming  back to this — plant growth and development,  

78
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,159
photosynthesis and shape  or morphology of the plant.  

79
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:29,600
This is very significant because in my laboratory  at Utah State University, we have been working on  

80
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:38,080
these two parameters full time to get them right.  Shuyang Zhen and I have published two papers  

81
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:46,160
just in the last year on this exact topic. And  this is primarily on the effects of wavelengths  

82
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:54,159
of light on photosynthesis. They're in these two  papers... we'll put these in green... they're in  

83
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,519
“Plant Cell and Environment” and “Frontiers in  Plant Science.” Two of our most prestigious,  

84
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,480
high-impact journals. They have long titles. You  can pause this and look at the titles or just  

85
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,440
search on Shuyang and Bugbee and you'll find the  papers will come right up in Google Scholar. Both  

86
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,600
of them are on the effects of photosynthesis.  This science is what led to the ePAR  

87
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:27,360
sensor. We could see the need for a sensor based  on this work. Here's Shuyang Zhen, and I'm very  

88
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,600
pleased to announce that she has now accepted  a position as an Assistant Professor at Texas  

89
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:43,120
A and M University. She's going to be continuing  this work there. It's very exciting work because  

90
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,200
it fundamentally changes the definition  of what we call photosynthetic radiation.  

91
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,319
We couldn't have done this work without funding  from both NASA and the USDA, and I want to  

92
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:05,120
acknowledge their help. For NASA, we're growing  plants on Mars and a colony on Mars. And for USDA,  

93
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,840
back to earth. This is the LAMP project:  Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profit. So it's  

94
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:20,160
a very applied focus project for greenhouses and  growth chambers on earth. We're very grateful to  

95
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:26,319
have this funding to be able to do this work. All  right, let's take a closer look at this. If we're  

96
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,680
going to change the definition of photosynthetic  radiation, which has been for years and years  

97
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,159
400 to 700 nm. We make students memorize  those numbers over and over again. Those  

98
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,679
are the wavelengths of photosynthesis. Now  we're going to... I'll put this in yellow…  

99
00:12:49,600 --> 00:13:02,399
400 to 750 nm — another 50 nm. I love  this quote from Carl Sagan in Cosmos,  

100
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:10,399
“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary  proof.” This is an extraordinary claim.  

101
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,279
We're going to change this definition. The old  sensors aren't going to capture that radiation.  

102
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:26,319
So here's the extraordinary proof. These are  two slides into the weeds on the biochemistry of  

103
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,520
photosynthesis. This isn't just an experimental  measurement, it's supplemented with a lot of  

104
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:41,199
detailed theoretical considerations. And I'll walk  you through this. This is a gorgeous slide made by  

105
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,920
my colleague, Marc van Iersel, who is a professor  at the University of Georgia. Shuyang Zhen by the  

106
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:54,399
way got her PhD with Marc working on this stuff.  And then she came to my lab as a postdoc, and  

107
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:01,840
now she's a professor. This is out of “Molecular  Cell Biology, Sixth Edition.” This is a textbook,  

108
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:10,319
but Marc has annotated this with what happens to a  photon. And this is a wonderful little animation.  

109
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:17,840
Here comes a photon. Boom! It hits. It's  absorbed. It's a reaction center. This right here,  

110
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,879
electron. Boom! That excites the electron.  It moves up to a higher excitation level.  

111
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:36,000
Then more photons come, hits an absorption site  over here, and that then moves that electron.  

112
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,840
Boom! All the way up to there. All the way from  the sun to here, to here, to here, to here,  

113
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,120
out. That's called the light reactions  of photosynthesis. And those reactions  

114
00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:00,480
make adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and NADPH.  That's the light reactions of photosynthesis. And  

115
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,240
if you can answer that on a test, you're ready to  graduate. This is a detailed light reaction. Now  

116
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,600
that is a lot of biochemistry, and I  really like physics more than chemistry.  

117
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:22,560
So I made a different diagram. And you can be  the judge of which one's easier to understand.  

118
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,719
We know from Albert Einstein and the  Stark-Einstein Law: one photon excites  

119
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,200
one electron. That's what Marc’s diagram just  showed us. But now I've got workers on towers  

120
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,480
more than the biochemistry of this. Here's the  sun right? So we're going to show the sun here...  

121
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:53,840
same as the other one. The sun is always smiling.  Photons come in. Boom! This guy hits this  

122
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:02,480
platform with the hammer. The electron goes up  here. Another worker catches it. Note that there's  

123
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,840
male workers here and female workers doing the  skilled positions at the top. They put it in here.  

124
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:17,599
It turns a mill, and it makes ATP. The energy  for photosynthesis. Another photon comes in.  

125
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:25,120
This one's coming in this way. Boom! Sends it  up here. Another worker puts it in a bucket,  

126
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:34,159
and we get NADPH. This is called Photosystem  II and Photosystem I. We knew one first. That's  

127
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:40,879
why they're backwards. Two happens before  one. But it takes photons from both sides  

128
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:48,159
to do this to fully excite all the electrons  for photosynthesis. Now we have known for over  

129
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:57,679
50 years that this worker right here can be  excited with far-red photons above 700 nm.  

130
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,279
But you can see if this guy was the only one that  was excited, this system wouldn't work because  

131
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,399
you got to have this side. You’ve got to have him  going up here, and then he does the second jump.  

132
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,400
This is synergism. And we've tried with far-red  light and it does nothing, and we say well that's  

133
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,920
no good. We've got to have visible light. When we  apply them both at the same time together, this  

134
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:31,840
guy is excited, this one is excited, and the whole  system is more synergistic. Now Shuyang worked  

135
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:41,360
on this in Georgia and showed that there was less  heat produced when she gave plants far-red light.  

136
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:48,559
When she came to Utah we started — this is called  the Emerson enhancement effect because it was  

137
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:56,879
shown by Emerson. Amazingly enough in the 1950s is  when Emerson's… then he was tragically killed in a  

138
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,560
crash of a small plane, and no one ever followed  up his work. It's an amazing story in science. So  

139
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:12,799
Shuyang comes along, and we start doing canopy  photosynthesis. Whole canopies of plants in a  

140
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:20,399
closed box. You can measure photosynthesis. And  we get this classic curve with 400 to 700 nm. This  

141
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:29,280
was with lettuce now. And it starts here at zero.  Goes up like this. Three points in this curve.  

142
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,680
When we gave them far-red  light, photosynthesis went up.  

143
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,000
But right here, this is 400 to 700  nm. We weren't counting it right.  

144
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,200
You don't count those photons. Whoa! But it made  photosynthesis go up. These are different levels  

145
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:56,879
went up. So what Shuyang did — graph this  400 to 750 nm. She counted it. Here it is.  

146
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:04,480
And look, all the data follows one nice smooth  curve because we're counting all the photons.  

147
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,319
When we got these experimental results  we went, “Wow! This is beautiful.  

148
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:20,000
But so far we've only shown it in lettuce. What  about other crops?” Shuyang did 17 crops: spinach,  

149
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,839
basil, kale, sunflower, corn. You can see them  all on here. And this is a picture of the plants  

150
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:32,079
in the chambers one at a time. To make a long  story short, every crop did the exact same thing.  

151
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:43,279
So this effect of far-red photons is universal for  many kinds of crops. This led to what I'd like to  

152
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,960
say is going to become a landmark publication  in Plant Cell and Environment from this work.  

153
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,400
But we kept going. We kept working on this.  The second paper, which is now published in  

154
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,640
Frontiers and Plant Science, looked at what  we call quantum yield over the long term.  

155
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,800
So this was like several weeks of a lettuce crop.  And quantum yield is... we have it right here...  

156
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,759
moles of carbon fixed per mole of photons  absorbed. It's a very precise measurement of  

157
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:31,839
photosynthetic efficiency and here's 350. This  is µmols... I'll put it over here... µmol m⁻²  

158
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:42,480
s⁻¹. That's PPFD. Note that this one had 350. This  one only had 300. So this one should have been  

159
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,480
much less, but we added 50 of far-red. So the sum  of these two is the same, and the quantum yield  

160
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,960
is the same. Down here this was with RB as  a red-blue background — like purple light.  

161
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,640
And it was the same with purple light. Then  we also did the same thing with white light,  

162
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:13,119
350 and 300 + 50. And the lines are the same.  That's compelling evidence that far-red photons  

163
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:20,159
are equally good to traditional photosynthetic  photons. And that's the underlying reason we need  

164
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,279
a sensor that includes them, particularly  for LEDs. Because all those LEDs have  

165
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:35,119
far-red photons now, and we need to measure  them. So that ePAR sensor includes these.  

166
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:46,879
So there's the classic. There's the new 750  nm. The ePAR sensor, if you look at this,  

167
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:59,680
includes some photons here. Those are UV photons.  And now I want to briefly talk about what UV does,  

168
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,800
and I'm going to base it both on McCree's  data and our data. Remember? Keith McCree,  

169
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,920
he's a wonderful guy, and as a young scientist  I had a chance to meet him. And he said, "Bruce,  

170
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,240
what are you working on?" And I told  him. And oh first he’d said, "Bruce,  

171
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,240
what's the most important question in your  discipline?" And I thought oh yeah it's  

172
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,839
probably this. And he said, "What are you working  on?" And I told him. And he says, "Why aren't you  

173
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,159
working on the most important thing in your  discipline? Get back to the lab. Get to work."  

174
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,840
It was really inspiring. So he gave us this. Now  we're adding on this. What about right here? Is  

175
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:47,039
this a sharp cut off right at 400 nm? This is  particularly important because now we have LEDs  

176
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:54,000
right in this region right here. I'm going  to show you these LEDs and show you why this  

177
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,799
end is also important. Here's four colors  of LEDs... and I'll put this one in blue…  

178
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:15,519
This one, we call violet. We don't have the names  on here. But violet is really quite an efficient  

179
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:22,160
LED, and it's right on the edge right  here. We call it UV. And look at this,  

180
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:31,600
a big part of that sensor is really UV radiation.  Do these cause photosynthesis? Let's take a look.  

181
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:42,880
Are these efficient over here? This sensor is just  inside of UV radiation but 2.22 µmol/J — that's  

182
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,320
an efficient LED. If this does unique things, we  need to be putting this in fixtures. These three  

183
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:59,279
are primarily UV. This one though has a tail  in the visible. So this is why we need to know  

184
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:06,319
exactly what's going on right here with  photosynthesis. Look what happens, 65% efficient.  

185
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:13,519
Excellent. 58%. 57%. 49%. These become less  efficient, but if they have unique effects  

186
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:22,319
we need to be using them. This one is becoming  increasingly used. These three are still emerging  

187
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,240
possibilities. But if we can show they  help, fixture manufacturers will use them.  

188
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:40,079
Here's the same graph just shown on a bigger  scale. This is UV-C down here, which we're also  

189
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,679
studying. This is very damaging, but  you give trace amounts and it has the  

190
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,680
potential to do good things. So here's the  same thing. The peak heights are proportional  

191
00:24:52,559 --> 00:25:00,960
to their efficiencies or their efficacies.  This is the standard blue right here 450  

192
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,720
nm. White LEDs start from this. This is very  common in all fixtures. Here's the violet right  

193
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:16,960
here. We'll put “V” for violet. And then the three  wavelengths of UV. What do they do to plants?  

194
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Here's McCree's curve. Everybody shows this,  and we look at it over and over again. What we  

195
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:34,559
just talked about... shown in red... is this curve  right here. We've now got compelling evidence that  

196
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:43,920
we need to shift this. What about this end? Look  at the tail on this end, and compare it to those  

197
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:52,560
three LED curves. What does this look like? Let's  take a deeper dive into McCree's original papers  

198
00:25:52,559 --> 00:26:00,799
on this to look at what the photosynthesis looked  like. This is a graph we made from McCree's data.  

199
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:14,960
And here is 400 nm right there. These are plants  from the field, and they sparingly use that UV  

200
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:24,240
light. Growth chamber plants. Wow! Look at this.  The growth chamber plants use the UV light.  

201
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,599
I used to think this was because they weren't  used to UV, and they didn't filter it out,  

202
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,519
and they used it all the time. But on closer  inspection of his data coupled with our own  

203
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:44,639
data of measurements of plants, now we know this  was just chance. They have used different species  

204
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,360
here in the growth chamber and the field. It  isn't because they were grown in the growth  

205
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:55,039
chamber. You just use different species.  Let's take a look at this. There's the UV  

206
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,720
that we're talking about. Look at the big error  bars in here. This is a fascinating area of study.  

207
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,720
Here's an example: lettuce and cucumber.  Both two high-value common species.  

208
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:19,732
Here's 400 nm right there. Cucumber minimally  uses UV light. Lettuce uses a lot of UV light. It  

209
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:29,120
much more effectively uses those UV photons. Now I  could show you all the other crops we've studied,  

210
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:36,639
but... sunflowers are actually pretty bad.  Sunflowers you'd think they were good. Some  

211
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:48,240
species are even more out here. But there's a  big range of curves in the UV among species. So  

212
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,120
for this reason, and I'll stop... We've got  one more summary slide... for this reason  

213
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:04,000
we have made... this is this is the old  data from McCree where it cuts off here.  

214
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,319
The new sensor comes out here, comes across at  1.0 all the way across, and then it doesn't have  

215
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:19,919
a sharp cutoff. It counts some of these UV  photons as a tapering response. So the big  

216
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:30,320
advantage is a little bit of UV right here and a  bunch of far-red there. That's the ePAR sensor.  

217
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:38,879
Now I'm going to close with a slide that  summarizes all the types of light on plants.  

218
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:49,199
Blue photons inhibit cell expansion. They make  plants small and compact. Green photons are fine  

219
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,080
for photosynthesis, but they're really important  for human vision. If we have green photons,  

220
00:28:54,079 --> 00:29:00,159
you can see the plants. Red photons are terrific —  efficient photosynthesis. Our fixtures have a lot  

221
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:07,360
of red photons. Far-red photons do the opposite of  blue. This inhibits cell expansion. These promote  

222
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:13,279
it. So as we go into the future, we're going  to be going back and forth between inhibiting  

223
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,680
and enhancing cell expansion with these colors  of light to shape the plant with photobiology.  

224
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:29,599
Here's an example. This happens to be cannabis:  5% blue, 20% blue. We shrunk the plant. Everything  

225
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:36,959
else was identical here. And generally a nice  compact plant is a good thing. But this plant  

226
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,319
is also a little bit wider than that plant, and  it captures more light. So you can see how...  

227
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:52,799
now we could put far-red... if I do that in red...  if we put far-red in here, this is going to look  

228
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,159
just like that with more blue. It's a  fascinating ability to manipulate plant shape.  

229
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,359
Human vision, you can see the green. This is white  LEDs. You can see the plants. There you can’t.  

230
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,799
That's significant. Here's far-red  light and lettuce. It's tremendously  

231
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:17,200
valuable. Look at that: 10% far-red = leaf  expansion. It's really valuable for lettuce.  

232
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:25,279
Unfortunately, the far-red light makes most  plants significantly taller. So we have to  

233
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:34,159
be very careful how we use it because it can  easily make tall skinny plants instead of  

234
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,600
short compact plants. This is all in front of  us: manipulating far-red, putting it on at the  

235
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,839
right place and the right time and the right crop.  But it's a very powerful tool, and that new ePAR  

236
00:30:45,839 --> 00:31:00,159
sensor now measures it. Thanks for listening.  We'll talk to you again in another video.
