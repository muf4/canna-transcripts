00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,609
hi my name is Skyler Smith I work with

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,410
the integrator and technical support

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,960
team here at Apogee instruments and

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,339
we're here to talk about connecting our

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,740
SP 214 pyrometer to the SMA cluster

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:20,219
controller very popular controller for

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:23,250
use in commercial solar applications the

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,649
SP 214 is an irradiance sensor in order

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,099
to see the watts per meter squared

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:32,850
available from the Sun so the first

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,238
thing to note is the SP 214 comes like

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,590
this with a four inch pigtail to connect

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:43,199
to so the sensor does need to be powered

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:45,120
24 volts power supply so you need to

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,190
know where your power supply is and then

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,308
how far away that is from your x8

17
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:52,019
terminal on the cluster controller

18
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:55,649
depending upon the distance you may need

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,329
to split the jacket like so and we have

20
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,390
the red and black over here that will

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,359
power the sensor and the green and white

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,569
which are the sensor output that will

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,400
connect into the controller so we'll go

24
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,618
ahead and right here in our example

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,700
we'll connect the red into the positive

26
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:18,478
on the power supply so we just slide

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,329
that down in there and this is just a

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,759
regular screw on terminal so we will

29
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,759
slide it in and tighten that down

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,650
and then the black will go in the

31
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:43,129
negative and same thing we will just

32
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:46,180
tighten the him there okay and then over

33
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:50,869
here on the controller itself we are on

34
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:53,090
x8 and the top row is a two so we're

35
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,990
going to go in a two for the white

36
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,150
connector a three for the green

37
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:01,819
conductor and these are just pushing

38
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:09,740
terminals so they just push in and then

39
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:12,799
our shield we will go into a four okay

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,060
so that's how you wire up the sensor

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,590
itself the next step is to change the

42
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,960
insulation curve and you do that through

43
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,270
the user interface for the SMA cluster

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,030
controller and so once you have that

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,409
interface pulled up on your computer

46
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:32,810
navigate to meteorology and then go to

47
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:36,129
environmental and then it go to a

48
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,840
radiant sensor and then go to

49
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,969
characteristic curve and when you're

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,129
there you just need to change it to zero

51
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:45,289
to twelve hundred and fifty watts per

52
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:49,699
meter square and as a reminder this is a

53
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:52,429
4 to 20 mili-amp sensor the other way

54
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:55,519
that you can look at this is on the

55
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,790
controller itself if you scroll down a

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,850
number of times then you get two analog

57
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:04,699
inputs analog current input number one

58
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,919
on the top there is showing us what the

59
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:08,659
data is reading from the center and in

60
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,030
our example here it's reading four point

61
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,060
zero 1 million which is correct for our

62
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,400
studio there is very little light and if

63
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,770
we hit down two more times we can see

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,360
the insulation converting that to 1

65
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,409
watts per meter squared it should be

66
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,540
correct

67
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:27,189
for normal applications you'll probably

68
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:29,090
be reading between 7 to 11 milliamps

69
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:30,039
depending on your time of day and

70
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,800
location

71
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:36,669
that concludes our SP 214 parinama tur

72
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,079
connecting to the SMA cluster controller

73
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,059
be sure to watch our other segment on

74
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,670
connecting our TS 100

75
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,890
aspirated radiation shield to the

76
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:48,679
cluster controller to get very accurate

77
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,829
ambient air temperature readings thank

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,830
you
