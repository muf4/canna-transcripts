00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,679
i'm bruce bugbee and i'm here in our

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,839
recording studio today

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,839
to talk about low-cost led fixtures for

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,879
home horticulture

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:18,559
now we do a lot of research on leds

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,160
color of leds efficiency of leds

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,960
but we use

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
high output leds that are expensive

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,679
hundreds of dollars

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,080
but there is a rapidly emerging market

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,159
of many options of lights that are

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,000
somewhere between twenty dollars and

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,398
forty dollars

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,238
and they work wonderfully for home

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,280
horticulture

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,519
at my house i have maybe a dozen of

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
these lights over plants

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,840
and if we cut away and went to my house

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,160
you'd see them but they're giant house

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,800
plants some there's a bird's eye fern

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,799
that's six feet tall under under these

22
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,320
lights and some peace lilies that are

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,479
big

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
they're fabulous for growing plants in

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,558
dark corners

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,000
they're also fabulous for growing leafy

27
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,239
greens on your kitchen counter

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
you do not have to spend hundreds of

29
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,118
dollars to

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
get very

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,920
useful effective lights so what i want

32
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,239
to do in the next few minutes is

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,519
review these lights

34
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,959
show you examples of the ones that i

35
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,959
have purchased and how they work the

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,280
advantages and disadvantage

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,959
of all these lights to help you make

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
better selections

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,280
so to start with that

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
we're going to go to

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
the amazon website which has lots of

42
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,000
lights you don't need to buy them from

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,840
amazon but there's many options and i

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,519
can quickly show you the options from

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
their site

46
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,759
and i can point out the pros and cons of

47
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,679
the lights and we'll start with a little

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,280
view of that and then we'll look at the

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,880
lights themselves

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,200
so here we are we just typed in led grow

51
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,519
light very generic search

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,079
and all of these lights come up look we

53
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:08,079
can scroll and scroll there's there's

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:11,199
dozens and dozens of lights on here

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,239
the first selection criteria is cost

56
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,919
look at these that are that are here

57
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,080
254 dollars 450 even this one's 159 you

58
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,639
do not need to pay that much

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,719
maybe if you're growing cannabis you

60
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,279
need highlight but we're talking about

61
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,680
growing leafy greens lettuce and basil

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,000
and spinach and all of your favorite

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,200
house plants under these you don't need

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,878
lights like that so you can screen down

65
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,639
here for price

66
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:43,039
under 25 25 to 50

67
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,719
that's a useful screening feature but

68
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,400
for now let's just

69
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,000
leave this there's no single brand

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,519
that's the best

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,519
these are all

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,239
they're made in china they're sometimes

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,239
they're hard to tell who makes them

74
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,200
here's the first point we scroll up a

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,039
little

76
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,280
many of these lights

77
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,959
are purple

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,479
rule number one

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
do not buy

80
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,799
purple lights

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,400
the reason they even exist is they're

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,879
slightly more electrically efficient

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,640
and you can save 10 cents a month on

84
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,439
your electric bill

85
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,119
but they're horrible to look work under

86
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,519
they're horrible to look they make the

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,239
plants look black

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,480
we don't we no longer use those at all

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,319
in our research and i don't recommend

90
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,119
them because they're

91
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,039
the

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
really difficult color

93
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,199
they are finally

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,640
going out of fashion there's many more

95
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,959
of the white leds than these

96
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,119
people say full spectrum well that's

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
fine these are these are full spectrum

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
lights but it's not because they make

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
the plants grow better it's because

100
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:55,039
they're much more pleasant to have in

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
your house the light quality is fine

102
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,679
most of these now

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
are a warm white color like the warm

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
white fluorescents you might have in a

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,318
bathroom

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,239
cool white means bright blue light and

107
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,479
sometimes that can be a little bit harsh

108
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,799
it's so blue in your house

109
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,840
so warm white is a really excellent

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,879
color most of these are warm white but

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,358
again

112
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,439
here's one that's not so bad eighty

113
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,319
dollars but i said we're going to look

114
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:27,439
at twenty to forty dollars so even this

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,199
one is getting up there in cost

116
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,199
they don't give you a lot of specs they

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,000
give you a lot of seaming specs in these

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,560
lights but most of them don't mean much

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,680
let's scroll down here

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,000
to we can probably just screen

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,800
um

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,199
um on that first page

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,199
doesn't even this first page doesn't

124
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
include any of the lights we've

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
purchased let's just try this

126
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,599
um

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
25 to 50 dollars

128
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,199
so we've edited this to

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,439
to be the 25 to 50 dollar lights

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,000
there there's many options you get rid

131
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:09,199
of the purple lights here's one it's

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,639
called the gray love sp 1000 let's take

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
a look at that

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,840
this is not a light that i have

135
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,239
purchased for analysis yet but i looked

136
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,279
at it before it looks promising

137
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
um

138
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:26,638
it's a it's a good-sized light and they

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,319
they show us the size in here 46 dollars

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,918
you get a lot of light from this might

141
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,959
be overkill for some things um

142
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,758
it it's dimmable you can you use high

143
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,399
medium and low this shows the uniformity

144
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,520
of the light oh i got to be careful to

145
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,560
touch this

146
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,799
let's go back to that

147
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
um

148
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,519
this shows the spectra it's it's warm

149
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,439
white it's got a lot of orange and red

150
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,519
not so much blue

151
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,519
and then after that it's uh

152
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,680
there's a dimmable

153
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,240
there's what else comes in the package

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,280
so this is a light worth considering in

155
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,478
this

156
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,679
but if you look closely at this

157
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,199
these are leds mounted on a board

158
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
and they're not focused they'll shoot

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,600
the light sideways so they kind of light

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,038
up your whole living room whether you

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
want it or not

162
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,959
it's possible to get lights with the

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
leds indented and then they're much more

164
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,680
focused

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
so

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,519
let's take a look

167
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,400
let me

168
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,000
take a look here

169
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,120
i'm not going to search through all

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,879
these lights let's skip to

171
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
this light right here

172
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,120
this one is a yes com

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,879
this was one of the early lights we

174
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,120
started buying this one

175
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,199
for research about

176
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,319
five or six years ago

177
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,038
it used to be about 22 dollars the

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,598
prices crept up a little bit

179
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,680
this is a fine light but it's a thin

180
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,719
panel and it's one of those lights that

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,639
shoots the light out sideways

182
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,680
so let me show you in a demonstration

183
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,560
the effect of a light that's focused and

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,319
one that's on a flat panel

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,319
and we've got lights set up right here

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,038
and i can wheel them in here

187
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,598
and plug them in

188
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,879
we lost our yellow cord

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,560
i guess i'll shoot the yellow cord went

190
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,560
away but i can plug them in here

191
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,918
these are very rigged up here just so we

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,598
can do this demo

193
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,038
and we'll get them

194
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,279
flat

195
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,639
see if we can get this flat

196
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,279
if you can see this

197
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,759
this light on the left

198
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,079
shoots the light sideways

199
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,199
let's let's do these one at a time

200
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,199
this one

201
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,280
is this light right here

202
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,598
shoots the light sideways

203
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,519
and i'm gonna unplug that a little bit

204
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,959
hard to see in the studio you can see

205
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,038
this is a

206
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,439
cool white light it's bright look at my

207
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,800
hand it looks it looks uh

208
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,598
white

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
not

210
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,719
flesh colored because this is a cool

211
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,839
white

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,479
and the light shoots sideways out and i

213
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,598
have found this light is undesirable

214
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,439
because

215
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,759
of the sideways light

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,000
so for a little bit more money

217
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,000
we

218
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,720
get this light

219
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,759
which i'm going to tilt it up so you can

220
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,759
see it

221
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,240
look at this it's still not bright

222
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,080
because the lights the leds are in set

223
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,639
and they're more focused

224
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
so this gives it more light right below

225
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,639
it and

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,919
this has less light pollution all over

227
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,319
your house than this one let's take a

228
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,399
look at the light output

229
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,320
to do this

230
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,720
you need a

231
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,278
light meter quantum sensor

232
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,680
these outputs are going to be similar

233
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,919
they take similar wattage

234
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,039
to do this we got to hold the

235
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,639
sensor

236
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,799
similar distance

237
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,120
these are not bright lights this one i'm

238
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,399
getting

239
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,759
31 micromoles per meter squared per

240
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
second

241
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,480
and this one

242
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,480
i'm getting

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,159
oop

244
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,239
sorry

245
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,679
we gotta get this back to the

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,278
like

247
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,879
i didn't have it on the right setting

248
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,039
let's do it again

249
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,200
this one i'm getting

250
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,199
460

251
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,120
below that light

252
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,720
and this one i am getting

253
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,759
460 below this light

254
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,480
so they're both a similar output

255
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,759
this light takes only 18 watts

256
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,360
this one takes 24 watts so by virtue of

257
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,278
being a little more focused it's a

258
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,839
little bit brighter right here

259
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,399
but the big difference is

260
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,519
side lighting and i have found these

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,720
inset lights to be

262
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
more

263
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,360
helpful for this

264
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,519
now let's wheel this

265
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,720
away for the moment and look at these

266
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,720
lights on the screen

267
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,480
keep our meter right there

268
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
yeah

269
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,078
we've got this set up

270
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,639
to

271
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,679
look at some other lights let me skip to

272
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,919
this nope skip to this one

273
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,919
this is the website for that focused

274
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,639
light you can see it's in depth you can

275
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,159
see the lights are inset nowhere do they

276
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,958
they show the picture of it but they

277
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,919
don't advertise that fixture here

278
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,078
this is a 21 light so this is a little

279
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,120
cheaper than the

280
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:10,159
previous light

281
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,399
again you just got to scroll and look

282
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,039
look through these to find the lights

283
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
with the features you you want because

284
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,559
there's no

285
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,879
clear identifying feature that would

286
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,159
tell you search just for this

287
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,360
light

288
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,639
let's go back to another light

289
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,720
right here

290
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,919
that's only it's 19.95 20.

291
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,920
here's this light

292
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,399
we've gotten a lot of these tested them

293
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,320
comes in a real nice box so if you want

294
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,120
to give it as a gift to someone this is

295
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,440
a great box now let's take a look at the

296
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
light

297
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,559
and i'm going to

298
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,559
plug this in

299
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,639
this light has a switch

300
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,838
so this is a combination

301
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,680
of reds

302
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,880
and i'm going to not point these right

303
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,958
at the camera

304
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,159
of reds and whites so it's somewhat of a

305
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,319
warm color

306
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,439
this is somewhat flexible you can put

307
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,760
the

308
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,160
the these together you can put them

309
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,679
apart there's two things you put them

310
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,719
under a shelf so that's a bit of an

311
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,638
advantage

312
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
note these are not in set so they give

313
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,680
you a lot of side lighting

314
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,639
um but this is called

315
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:32,000
a this is one that does have a name a

316
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,919
sepal led grow light

317
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,078
when these say 20 watts that doesn't

318
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,599
mean that's the power they take that's

319
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,759
some advertising thing similar to the

320
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
what the equivalent of an incandescent

321
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,480
would be

322
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,278
but in this case

323
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,839
this one is about a 20 watt light so

324
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,799
this is like worth considering

325
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,240
um

326
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,240
because of the flexibility and low cost

327
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,440
now let's look at um

328
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,440
we've that one that one this one

329
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,000
here's here's another warm white um one

330
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:16,958
in a box oop i don't want to

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,958
don't want to do that

332
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,039
here is one

333
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,199
that is purple it's got a few blues in

334
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,159
it but it's purple

335
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
when i hit the reorder on this light at

336
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,600
amazon

337
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,560
the the light i ordered did not come up

338
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,920
with the exact website a purple light

339
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,239
came up so apparently this manufacturer

340
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,958
has replaced their wonderful warm white

341
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,278
light with the purple light

342
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,638
so it's unfortunate but you got to be

343
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,639
careful to

344
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,879
screen these

345
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,159
and then finally this is the this is one

346
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,799
that we haven't tested um but it's

347
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,120
another possibility you can go in here

348
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,439
and count the leds

349
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
on the from their pictures

350
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,040
um

351
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,679
but this is

352
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,039
the 45 dollars roughly gets you twice

353
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,519
the amount of light as a 20 dollar light

354
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,360
but these are sort of overkill they have

355
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,320
more light than you really would need

356
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,320
for most plants

357
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,039
i think that's all i want to say about

358
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,240
these

359
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,639
buy them and use them i it will enrich

360
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,198
your life they put them you need them on

361
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,079
a time clock so you have to buy a little

362
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:37,120
some of them have timers

363
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,239
and you buy a time clock and keep them

364
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
on

365
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
one more thing i forgot to show you one

366
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,039
light

367
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,480
here's a box this is a light that comes

368
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,879
in tubes

369
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,199
and you open the box

370
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,198
and

371
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,278
the light

372
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,159
looks like this

373
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:03,519
and we've mounted those tubes

374
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:07,198
on a piece of styrofoam here plug it in

375
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,240
here i could plug this one in

376
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:13,838
this is also a fine light

377
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
this one's got a switch

378
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,399
this one's dimmable

379
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,278
so we can

380
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,360
do multiple levels

381
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,439
but this is a nice one because you can

382
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,240
put these in long linear strips this is

383
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,279
one of the defining characteristics but

384
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,440
you can see lots of lights now with

385
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,198
warm white leds that's a great thing for

386
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,399
options

387
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,198
so

388
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,078
let's take a look at what it costs to

389
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,399
run these lights per month on your

390
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,879
electric bill because people get

391
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,078
concerned and rightly so

392
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,838
so here's one

393
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,719
most of these lights

394
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,920
are about 20 watts

395
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,079
so it's the same as a 20 watt light bulb

396
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:03,360
so what does that cost

397
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,359
so if we have let's get our pin up here

398
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,439
if we have 20

399
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,839
watts times

400
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,560
we're going to run these for 16 hours hr

401
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,040
per day that's a typical time you don't

402
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,879
want to run at night keeps people up and

403
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,319
some plants don't like to have light all

404
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,639
the time so 20 times 16

405
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,600
is 320

406
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,759
watt

407
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,600
hours this is watt hours per day

408
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,800
and this is 0.32

409
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,839
kilo

410
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,879
watt

411
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,720
hours

412
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,240
this is how we pay for electricity

413
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,959
kilowatt hours

414
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:52,320
so it takes .32 kilowatt hours per day

415
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:55,198
and now let's take that times 10 cents

416
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,040
per kilowatt power this is a real

417
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,919
typical price for

418
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,159
residential electricity you can see the

419
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:06,000
math that cancels out

420
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:09,119
this equals 3.2

421
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,119
cents per day

422
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,679
or

423
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,599
30 days in a month

424
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
we're about one

425
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,838
dollar

426
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,838
per month

427
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,318
to run

428
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,279
a 20 watt

429
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,960
light

430
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,480
12 a year i submit that unless you're

431
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,319
really out of money

432
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,839
that's some of the best twelve dollars

433
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,519
in a year you're going to spend is

434
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,240
running these lights and growing great

435
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,599
plants they don't cost much

436
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,359
if you get a big one a bright one

437
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,159
this might go let's put that in a

438
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,279
different color here

439
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,679
red

440
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,440
they might get up to nah red's not a

441
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
good color

442
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,880
blue

443
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,480
they might get up

444
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,520
to 40

445
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,759
watts

446
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,519
but then everything doubles and if it's

447
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,519
a 40 watt

448
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,359
now you're looking at two dollars a

449
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:09,038
month

450
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:12,079
still still uh not expensive

451
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:15,038
big lights for leds now we're talking

452
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,759
much more now we're talking

453
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,679
100 times this easily to get bright

454
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,160
light to grow real high light crop

455
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,080
plants but none of the plants we're

456
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,440
talking about are highlight so there's

457
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:30,399
the math and the cost per month

458
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,160
so i would like to

459
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,280
walk over here and show you our

460
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,880
venus flytrap research that we have

461
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,759
going on

462
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,400
with

463
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,400
one of these lights

464
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,960
we've done a lot of research on

465
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,120
nutrition of venus fly traps here's a

466
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,919
few of them most of the research is done

467
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,239
now

468
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,200
but here's one of these lights warm

469
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,519
white mountain under the counter focused

470
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,840
you can see my hand looks flesh colored

471
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,720
under this light the plants grow great

472
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,879
this is just a little lid to keep them

473
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,200
healthy these are really healthy venus

474
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,440
flytrap plants and we've had them a long

475
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,640
time in here so it's a really good

476
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,600
example of what you can do with lights

477
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,679
venus flytraps are tricky to grow

478
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:25,439
but under this steady light they love it

479
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
keep them keep a lid on to keep a little

480
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,720
bit higher humidity you can see one of

481
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
them's flowering

482
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
in here

483
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,960
so there's an example of

484
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,000
these lights

485
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,240
thanks for listening i hope this video

486
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,359
inspires you to buy some of these lights

487
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,359
for home horticulture
