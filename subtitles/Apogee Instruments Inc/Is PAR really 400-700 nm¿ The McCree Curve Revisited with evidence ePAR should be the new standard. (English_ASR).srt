1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,019
I'm Bruce bugbee president of apogee

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,080
instruments and also professor of grub

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:13,320
physiology at Utah State University

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,900
and in this talk today I want to talk

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,579
about

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,560
modifications to our fundamental

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,059
understanding of photosynthetic

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,399
radiation

9
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,820
and I especially want to talk about the

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:32,460
two edges of the cutoffs at 400 and at

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:36,299
700. now this talk is a modified version

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,880
of an address I gave two weeks ago at a

13
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:42,539
controlled environments conference at

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,120
the in Tucson Arizona it was a big

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,939
conference and uh I was asked to talk

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,038
about this and an invited talk but that

17
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,920
that talk wasn't recorded so now we're

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,320
going to record it for you I love

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,320
starting this off with the Dark Side of

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,140
the Moon the prism divides up the colors

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,899
and we and we analyze them and now we

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,159
have LEDs is a very powerful tool to

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,379
study these effects photobiology

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,200
and but we did used to use prisms a long

25
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:16,438
time ago so it's a really amazing change

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,478
the tools we have to study this and of

27
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,579
course not only are they great tools for

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,079
fundamental research but they're great

29
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,700
tools for growing crops too so we're

30
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,599
simultaneously doing work on them and

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,939
studying their commercial effects

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,399
so to start with this I want to start

33
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,158
with sunlight and look at the ratios of

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,219
color in sunlight and make the point

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,880
that there's not a lot of photons down

36
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:48,060
around 400 so the cutoff down here is

37
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,298
less critical than the cutoff at 700

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,478
because there's a lot of photons at 700.

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,020
so let's take a look at sunlight here's

40
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,819
a classic curve of sunlight

41
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:02,158
worldwide close to solar new and this

42
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,339
changes just subtly with time of year

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,600
and time of day it changes a little but

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,020
not a lot

45
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,598
look at this three percent let me turn

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,760
on my pen here

47
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:18,359
and we can highlight some of this

48
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,519
there's only three percent of the

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,220
photons right in here that sunlight

50
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,739
because of atmospheric filtering drops a

51
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,800
lot right at 400.

52
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:32,060
so even if we change the definition down

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,260
here in sunlight this is a small effect

54
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,020
but we still want to look at this

55
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,598
because it's important for LEDs as well

56
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,560
as studies in sunlight but look at over

57
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,238
here 18 percent this cutoff makes a big

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,939
difference for our measurements of

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,340
photosynthetic radiation

60
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:54,120
let's take a look at this

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,098
for LEDs which is why we're so keenly

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,560
interested in this if this if all we

63
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,419
ever did was measure photosynthesis in

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,739
sunlight we wouldn't be so concerned

65
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,179
about this

66
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:09,900
but look at our collection of LEDs

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,420
this was a this beautiful slide showing

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,700
the peak wavelengths the classic things

69
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,439
that there's not efficient green they're

70
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,518
in the middle but look at right here

71
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,859
there's some very efficient Violet LEDs

72
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,080
right near the cut off and the same

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,760
thing up here we have a very efficient

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:33,239
far red LED and they are being used in

75
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,340
light fixtures to manipulate plant shape

76
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,819
so we really need to know if these

77
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,780
photons are also photosynthetic there's

78
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,518
the Violet there's the far red and

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,259
because these are being used we want to

80
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:53,879
know this graph was made by Paul kasuma

81
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:56,759
who was got his PhD with me in 2021 last

82
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,039
year he graduated he's now at waganingan

83
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,399
University so we've had a long

84
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,459
relationship with waganingan

85
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,739
sharing Talent back and forth and and

86
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,959
we've worked closely with Leo Marcellus

87
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,599
there

88
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,360
it's been a great relationship so what I

89
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:19,019
want to do now is oh first let me

90
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,479
emphasize two papers that Paul consumer

91
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,819
wrote These are not on the cutoffs but

92
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,459
they're on LEDs and they're if you want

93
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,740
to get state of the art where LEDs are

94
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:32,219
now and where they can go search for

95
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,978
kusuma and bugbee and you'll see our

96
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,320
referee Journal artists come up this

97
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:40,379
one's called from physics to fixtures to

98
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,120
food current and potential efficacy

99
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,060
where are they going to go in the next

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,160
five or ten years and also Photon

101
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,079
efficacy and Horticulture is a real

102
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:56,460
detailed analysis of all the colors

103
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:58,859
so let's take a look at the

104
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:01,319
what we know about first the short

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,120
wavelengths here the efficacy there's

106
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,759
there's the part we're going to zoom in

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,899
now on the next graph

108
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:15,000
now we got 250 to 500 and here's our

109
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:17,698
classic blue LED that's very widely used

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,579
this is the a very efficient LED it's

111
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:25,259
used as the base phosphor for white LEDs

112
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:28,198
but we also have a series of LEDs right

113
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,020
close to 400 nanometers

114
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,180
and it's real critical to know

115
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,538
how efficient these are they're being

116
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,220
used in fixtures because they can have

117
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:41,099
significant morphological effects on

118
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,919
Plants since triggering secondary

119
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,039
metabolism but are these do these

120
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:50,459
photons cause photosynthesis

121
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:54,000
so to look at this I want to go back and

122
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:58,198
look at the Historical studies on

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,139
Quantum yield from photosynthesis

124
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,080
this is a from a paper I published in

125
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,819
five years ago 2017 it's it's a book

126
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,819
chapter

127
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,038
but here's the very famous McCree curve

128
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,120
that hundreds more than hundreds

129
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:18,180
thousands of people cite this paper from

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,959
1971 but if we he wasn't the first to do

131
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,500
this

132
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,739
a scientist named Hoover did it in 1937.

133
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,978
Imagine the technology he had that's 90

134
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,038
years ago to do this where they got

135
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:35,219
similar curves not identical but similar

136
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:38,939
and then a Japanese scientist and not

137
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,520
have repeated this in 1976.

138
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:44,219
at first glance these are similar but

139
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,099
look at the area right here McCree shows

140
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,620
a big taper Hoover shows a sharp cut off

141
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,379
inada shows a relatively sharp cut off

142
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,139
right down here in the UV

143
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,180
you can ask why do we cite mccree's

144
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,360
paper so much when there's other

145
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,600
literature on this it is because his

146
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,139
paper is exceptionally well written and

147
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,660
as a series of two papers

148
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:12,180
and they're very comprehensive papers

149
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,580
it's a great example to graduate

150
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,918
students to read how clear his writing

151
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,579
is in these papers here's Keith McCree

152
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,500
and I as a young scientist I had the

153
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,959
opportunity spend time with him he came

154
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,660
to Utah State University to give us a

155
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,719
seminar and he spent an afternoon in my

156
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:34,199
lab there was it was a it was a great

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,319
thing to know him he died in 2014.

158
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,319
so let's take a look at his studies

159
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,199
right here and on UV light

160
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,800
we're going to blow this up

161
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:50,220
what McCree found was there was a large

162
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:55,199
species variability in response to these

163
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,300
UV photons he studied 21 species and

164
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,240
I've taken from his data

165
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,598
the one that was the most responsive to

166
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,519
UV and the species that was leased and

167
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,279
it turns out radishes is the most

168
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,399
responsive sunflower was the least and

169
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,500
if all crops were like radish you bet we

170
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,959
would move the goal posts we would count

171
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,879
these photons but if they're all like

172
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,279
sunflower you can start to argue we

173
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,418
should move it the other direction

174
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,500
but

175
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:27,959
crops vary a lot and when how fast this

176
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,598
drops off in the relative photosynthetic

177
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,338
efficiency now some flowers and radishes

178
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,860
are not big crops in controlled

179
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,539
environment but lettuce and cucumbers

180
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,759
are

181
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,519
here's lettuce and cucumber

182
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:46,700
they're intermediate they both drop

183
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:51,720
quite fast right here right close to 400

184
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:54,000
nanometers this is mccree's data now he

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,879
had to use prisms and filters to get

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,200
this data it's amazing what he did given

187
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:05,338
the equipment he had now fast forward

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,879
50 years to where we are today with

189
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:10,980
state-of-the-art LEDs so we set out in

190
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,379
my laboratory to see if we could

191
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,360
reproduce these curves using those

192
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,200
Violet LEDs that I showed you

193
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,000
state-of-the-art gas exchange equipment

194
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,860
state-of-the-art LEDs

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,399
and here's what we found

196
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,039
now this was done by Shu young Jen who

197
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,919
is a very talented young scientist she

198
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,740
was got her PhD she was a postdoc with

199
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,219
me she's now an assistant professor at

200
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,919
Texas A M University these are her data

201
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,639
in in my lab

202
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:46,979
remember that radish from mccree's data

203
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,419
was one of the best look at that radish

204
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,060
is one of the best remember that

205
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,958
sunflower was one of the worst we

206
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:58,559
repeated mccree's data using 50 years

207
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,958
better technology and cucumber was in

208
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,518
the middle Tomatoes up there with radish

209
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,399
uh

210
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,860
it's it's just quite remarkable that we

211
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,659
were able to repeat his data how about

212
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,379
lettuce

213
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:15,059
here's lettuce

214
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:18,299
these curves

215
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,679
um they go they down to maybe maybe 70

216
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,919
percent

217
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,919
um at 380 nanometers this is a good

218
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,139
point here Marshall is a purple lettuce

219
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,979
with a lot of anthocyanin and that does

220
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,539
not use UV photons well at all those

221
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,200
anthocyanins are pigments that block the

222
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:40,639
UV we think the species variability is

223
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,220
just blocking of the UV and the cuticle

224
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:47,458
which is for protective reasons

225
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,579
that take home message from this is

226
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:53,578
these curves drop off fast

227
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:56,458
and we don't see any reason to change

228
00:10:53,578 --> 00:11:00,479
the definition of photosynthetic

229
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:01,578
radiation from 400 nanometers from what

230
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,440
we have today

231
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:07,199
unless you're doing work with some hot

232
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,760
species that can use them and in that

233
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,759
case you ought to buy a spectral

234
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,159
radiometer so you can precisely count

235
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,679
these photons

236
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,480
so now let's move to the other end of

237
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,019
the spectrum

238
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,139
boom look at this effect this is why

239
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,959
this is such a big deal this this has

240
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:31,199
been repeated Now by scores of other

241
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:33,000
scientists and Laboratories we know that

242
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,820
far red lettuce

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,639
makes the lettuce leaf expansion take

244
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,820
off and this is a picture of lettuce

245
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,778
without far red and 10 percent far red

246
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,800
this is a big deal lots of literature on

247
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:49,439
this

248
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,500
here's the question it's not

249
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,440
controversial to say that far red

250
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,958
triggers a shade avoidance response and

251
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,540
makes the plants get bigger because they

252
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,299
think they're in shade that we've known

253
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:06,120
for years we know that happens

254
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:09,479
but is all of this dramatic Improvement

255
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,620
caused by Photon capture and leaf

256
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,500
expansion

257
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:17,759
or is some of it caused by for Direct

258
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:22,620
effects on photosynthesis and that

259
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:26,578
finding is profound because remember

260
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:30,360
we've said for since McCree

261
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:33,059
400 to 700 is our range

262
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,539
but now do these far red photons

263
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:39,479
contribute to that that is a

264
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:41,360
extraordinary claim to say that we

265
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,680
should change our fundamental definition

266
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,860
of photosynthesis

267
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:50,699
now for this extraordinary claim

268
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:54,839
we require extraordinary proof

269
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:57,540
and I bring in Carl Sagan who in the

270
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:02,279
series of Cosmos said extraordinary

271
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:04,500
claims require extraordinary proof

272
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:08,100
so what I'm now going to show you is the

273
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,039
extraordinary proof that far red photons

274
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,019
cause photosynthesis in the next few

275
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,458
slides

276
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:18,778
for this we start with papers of Shu

277
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:22,739
yang zhen

278
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:24,838
who was a young PhD student with Mark

279
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,120
Van ersle who was

280
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,160
a distinguished professor at the

281
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,820
University of Georgia many years ago

282
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,439
Mark Van ersold was a postdoc with me

283
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,740
and then of course recently Shu young

284
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,980
was a postdoc Mark got his bachelor's

285
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,139
degree at wagoningan University and had

286
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,899
opportunities in the United States and

287
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:49,379
came across the ocean here although he

288
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:52,679
maintains his ties with wagoningan

289
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:56,220
Chu young and Mark first published a

290
00:13:52,679 --> 00:14:00,199
paper in 2017. these are all very

291
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,060
reputable are highly high impact factor

292
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,300
reputable journals Journal of plant

293
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:10,399
physiology they and I'm not going to go

294
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:14,219
into all the details but they studied

295
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,700
the light reactions

296
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,278
of photosynthesis in this paper

297
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,399
and showed that the far red photons

298
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,139
clearly improve the light reactions of

299
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,958
photosynthesis we'll come back to that

300
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,839
in a minute in the second paper a year

301
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,919
later physiologica plantarum they use

302
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,160
laser LEDs at specific wavelengths to

303
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:42,539
show that that the photons at least up

304
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:45,899
to 730 nanometers were improving the

305
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:50,219
light reactions of photosynthesis

306
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:52,799
so after this work in Mark's lab

307
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,459
I recruited Shu young to come work with

308
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:59,639
me because we have a canopy gas exchange

309
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:03,179
system it's very sophisticated system

310
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,759
but it measures photosynthesis of the

311
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,919
whole plant communities continuously

312
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,639
over the whole life cycle there's 10

313
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:14,698
Chambers there's a few shown here using

314
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,500
this canopy gas exchange system and

315
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:19,319
precise measurements of canopy

316
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,940
photosynthesis we published a paper in

317
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,760
plant cell and environment and other

318
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,000
high impact Journal far red photons have

319
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,879
equivalent efficiency to Shorter

320
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,659
wavelength photons implications for

321
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,620
redefining par

322
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,778
this is now

323
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,000
two years old

324
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:40,860
we kept going because we were interested

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,078
in the long-term effects this was

326
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,440
short-term effects with and without far

327
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:48,479
red on canopy photosynthesis so we did a

328
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,180
study with long-term effects through the

329
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,639
whole life cycle and again showed these

330
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:57,000
far red photons where

331
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,759
it had equivalent efficiency to the the

332
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,519
shorter wavelength photons and this is

333
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,458
in Frontiers in plant science so

334
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,560
we get four

335
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:09,539
significant Journal articles now from

336
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,958
two different Laboratories showing the

337
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:16,500
value of these because of this work

338
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:20,219
most colleagues have now switched to

339
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,980
including photons up to 750 nanometers

340
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,800
as photosynthetic when they're doing

341
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,278
studies in controlled environments

342
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,979
it doesn't just stop with our papers

343
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:35,458
because two other research groups that

344
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,940
study this have now reported on this

345
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:40,379
Zhao at all 2019

346
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,720
terashima is a well-known scientist

347
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,958
plant and cell physiology well-known

348
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,040
Journal these are supporting papers so

349
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,479
the

350
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:55,198
technical studies on this are providing

351
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,139
that extraordinary proof that we need to

352
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,578
change our understanding of far red

353
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,539
photons

354
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,539
so

355
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,459
to

356
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,279
make a claim like this it's not

357
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,459
adequate to just say you have empirical

358
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,099
evidence that this occurs

359
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:21,959
you need a mechanism coupled with the

360
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:24,779
empirical evidence and as I say

361
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,519
our understanding of how the world Works

362
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:30,178
requires

363
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:33,179
a coupling of measurements and models

364
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:36,360
and data and Theory

365
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:40,019
so this is the theory that supports that

366
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:42,418
without the theory maybe 400 years ago

367
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,339
we said the moon is made of green cheese

368
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,100
well that must have been because of

369
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:50,459
reflected light you know that's a common

370
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:52,079
common myth and people said you're nuts

371
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,940
you know there's no mechanism behind

372
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,099
that and think of all the observations

373
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,519
we have without mechanisms

374
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:01,859
that usually means the observations have

375
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,179
something wrong about them or they're

376
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,119
incomplete

377
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:10,679
but in the case of far red photons I go

378
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,298
to my favorite Twin Towers diagram of

379
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,280
how the light reactions of

380
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:17,579
photosynthesis work

381
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:21,480
so we know from the Stark Einstein law

382
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:23,819
our body with the wild hair one Photon

383
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,759
excites one electron

384
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,379
that's why we count photons a photon

385
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,558
comes in

386
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,260
it hits the light reactions boom it

387
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:37,319
excites an electron that electron

388
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:40,500
Cascades down in energy and it makes ATP

389
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:44,819
another Photon comes in boom Another

390
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,759
electron goes up and this makes nadph

391
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:51,119
this is photosystem two this is

392
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:53,700
photosystem one water is split here and

393
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,979
the photosystems but this is a really

394
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,740
good example of the energy state of

395
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,860
photons exciting electrons in

396
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:06,058
photosynthesis here's the key

397
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:09,359
this guy over here can be excited with

398
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:12,779
far red photons we've known that for 50

399
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,119
years and that is called the Emerson

400
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:18,599
enhancement effect

401
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:22,678
that these photons can excite electrons

402
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:25,558
in photosystem one and in fact if you

403
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,380
don't have any far red photons these two

404
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:31,019
photosystems that run in closely

405
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,080
synchronized closely synchronized

406
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:36,000
process can get out of balance

407
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,359
so this is the

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,819
theory that underlies this there's other

409
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,159
many ways to show this but I I've liked

410
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:46,019
this Twin Towers

411
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,440
diagram which which I got out of a

412
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:52,740
photochemistry book to show where the

413
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,700
photons come in

414
00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:00,419
so now let's take a closer look at this

415
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:04,200
back to the full sunlight Spectrum

416
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:07,440
so far we have only shown this under

417
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,120
electric lights where we add far red and

418
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,380
we take it away that's compelling

419
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,439
evidence

420
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,020
but if it works under electric lights it

421
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,880
should also work under sunlight the

422
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,379
effect should also be present under

423
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,559
sunlight

424
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,200
so now in the final series of studies

425
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,639
and this is with Shu youngjen Mark Van

426
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,400
ersel and myself

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,038
we undertook to make these measurements

428
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,900
in sunlight now there's 18 percent

429
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,879
photons out here

430
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,559
so that's what we're looking for is an

431
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,460
18 effect

432
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:44,819
to do this we filtered the light bought

433
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:48,240
special filters that cut this off

434
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,980
and there's our filter far red filter it

435
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,160
was a very nice filter Cuts this off

436
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,240
cleaning it 700 these photons are gone

437
00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:00,600
this filter also cut out the UV now

438
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,200
remember we hypothesized that UV is not

439
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:06,659
going to have a big effect that does so

440
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,500
we added measurements with the third

441
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,538
filter that only filtered UV this is

442
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,660
blocked let this through

443
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:17,940
when we put the UV filter on leaves and

444
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,120
when I say weed that means true young

445
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,679
did the work making the measurements in

446
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,918
the trenches

447
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:30,179
less than one percent so these photons

448
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,280
as predicted had a small blocking them

449
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,559
had a very small effect on

450
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:39,119
photosynthesis that's part of the reason

451
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:41,220
we say 400 cut off at the bottom is is a

452
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,798
good cutoff we see no reason to change

453
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,538
that but what happened up here with the

454
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:48,720
far red filter

455
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:54,839
peanut decreased 12 percent

456
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:57,120
now remember there's 18 photons up here

457
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,279
and there's a number of issues up here

458
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,558
with how high was the light what was

459
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,418
saturating

460
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,879
this number doesn't precisely match this

461
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,980
but that's a big decrease in

462
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,840
photosynthesis

463
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,298
and if it's not caused by this you got

464
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,298
to hypothesize something else it does it

465
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:18,658
and it wasn't temperature we measured a

466
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:22,619
number of things with this research

467
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:25,440
this data shows that far red photons are

468
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:28,079
important in sunlight as well as

469
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,580
electric lights but now let's look at

470
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:35,460
one other case for plant ecology

471
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:38,399
understory crops we when we start

472
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,919
measuring Global photosynthesis what

473
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,220
happens to these plants down here that

474
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:47,038
get filtered light the far red light is

475
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,460
transmitted to these plants and if we

476
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:54,480
make a spectral curve of this

477
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:57,538
is filtered this is transmitted so

478
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,798
suddenly for these understory crops in

479
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,179
here

480
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,179
wow

481
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,038
more than half of their photons are far

482
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:08,340
red photons

483
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,440
this has huge implications are we only

484
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:12,359
going to count these photons and in here

485
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,500
green are we going to count all of those

486
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,719
photons

487
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,119
so we made measurements of understory

488
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,120
crops

489
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:23,399
filtered by leaves what did we find

490
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,939
here's the filter applying that filter

491
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:31,440
we block this let the green come through

492
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:35,580
peanut decreased 40 to 60 percent

493
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,340
this is a huge effect and it further

494
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:41,158
emphasizes the value of far red photons

495
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:43,500
in global climate change research our

496
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,559
global climate change models

497
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,079
this is a big finding

498
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,000
and throughout all of this work to

499
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,899
collect these data we knew it was a big

500
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,119
finding so we published this in a very

501
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,880
high impact Journal called new

502
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:03,479
phytologist this is an impact factor

503
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,000
above 10. it's reserved for

504
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,339
groundbreaking research look at the date

505
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,960
July 2022 this is a recent publication

506
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:15,779
photosynthesis in Sun and shade the

507
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,900
surprising importance of far red photons

508
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:21,019
so I refer you to this paper for the

509
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,179
details of how we did the work

510
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:26,400
we got a lot of excellent reviews from

511
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,080
some prestigious photobiologists and

512
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,059
this and they were very appreciative of

513
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,460
our work

514
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:35,399
so the collective

515
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,919
body of evidence indicates that we need

516
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,940
to be counting photons

517
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:45,900
from 700 to 750 so what does this look

518
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:48,120
like now back to the McCree curve the

519
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,759
classic McCree curve

520
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:55,019
once again we don't see evidence to move

521
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:58,140
the goal post here but up on this end

522
00:24:55,019 --> 00:25:00,720
remember McCree did not do synergistic

523
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:04,440
effects this was one wavelength at a

524
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,720
time and had he done synergistic

525
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,820
wavelengths far red and shorter

526
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,400
wavelengths together

527
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,859
he the evidences that he would have seen

528
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,960
the same thing we did these are

529
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,719
synergistic with this

530
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,340
and so now the new definition adds this

531
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,259
out here to the curve so the old metric

532
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:28,798
there's 750

533
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,599
the old metric was called par

534
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:36,359
the new metric

535
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:39,000
we've been calling epar for extended par

536
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,459
and we're recommending people report

537
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,880
both of these in their studies but they

538
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:48,240
focus on epar as the fundamentally best

539
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,520
metric and multiple other Laboratories

540
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,200
are doing exactly that they're setting

541
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,418
they're counting these photons as

542
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,419
photosynthetic in their research

543
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,740
this is

544
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,359
has a number of implications and I want

545
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,200
to review those now

546
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:11,278
so the move from par to epar

547
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,679
number one efficiency of fixtures

548
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,319
are we going to count these photons in

549
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,620
LED fixtures and all the evidences we

550
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:23,579
should be counting them

551
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:26,819
asabe does standards for this and so far

552
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,558
their old standard is 400 to 700

553
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:32,399
nanometers

554
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:35,759
but they're meeting again to revise this

555
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,519
and people on this committee have told

556
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,379
us we need to change the standard in in

557
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:44,819
the light of all the evidence we now

558
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:48,299
have for uh epar as an improved metric

559
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,678
over par so this is one big implication

560
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,440
of this

561
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,019
second one is the design light

562
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:59,159
Consortium rates lamps and they becoming

563
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:00,658
a go-to standard for efficacy of LED

564
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,720
lights

565
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:06,539
if they do not count far red protons

566
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,079
they penalize the lighting manufacturers

567
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:12,119
that add far red to their lights

568
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,399
so they're looking at making this change

569
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,000
too and they probably will have two

570
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,820
metrics par and epar to help people

571
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,480
select the best

572
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:27,899
lighting fixtures and then finally

573
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,298
in portable photosynthesis systems which

574
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,960
we use a lot to measure photosynthesis

575
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:37,798
they use LEDs to light the leaves

576
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,679
but historically they've not had far red

577
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:44,400
LEDs in the heads of these portable

578
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:46,140
photosynthesis systems so that means

579
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,720
they get artifacts and they

580
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,360
underestimate true photosynthesis under

581
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,460
sunlight

582
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:55,319
and it also inhibits further studies on

583
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,900
this because the LEDs don't include far

584
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,899
red but there's one exception

585
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,200
PP systems have now come out with a new

586
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:08,278
gas exchange it's called the Cirrus 4

587
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:12,179
and that one has a far red LEDs in the

588
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:15,419
head so it's continuing evidence that

589
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:18,240
the world's changing to a new definition

590
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,759
many people use a lycor portable

591
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,980
photosynthesis system and we're told

592
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,558
that lycor is looking to add these far

593
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,058
red LEDs and the head of their meter as

594
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:29,819
well

595
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:32,038
this is the end of the story but

596
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:34,859
we need to help you make these

597
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:37,379
measurements and to do that we need a

598
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,240
new suite of sensors

599
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,880
so

600
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,120
apogee instruments

601
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,480
came out with first of all

602
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,759
they've come out with a e-par sensor now

603
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,860
let me draw here's the sensor silver

604
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,798
looks like this

605
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:58,699
let me draw this on the board

606
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:58,700
here is

607
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:05,600
we count the photons equally here's 400

608
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,600
700 par

609
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,058
just like the slide shows

610
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:14,700
this sensor goes to 750

611
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:18,960
and it's and it's called epar

612
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:22,798
extended photosynthetic Act of radiation

613
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,419
in sunlight this adds

614
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:29,879
about 18 percent to the to the total

615
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,360
photosynthetic radiation

616
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,580
under electric lights it may only add

617
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,459
three or four percent unless you're

618
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:43,500
using Farid LEDs and now that under

619
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:47,579
electric lights it can add 18 as well

620
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:51,058
because of this effect and because the

621
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:55,019
we have the traditional par and the new

622
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:58,980
epar apogee also made

623
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:02,519
this sensor it's a black sensor this is

624
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,220
a hooked up to a micro cache data logger

625
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,839
this sensor is called

626
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,819
the par

627
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,339
far

628
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:14,038
sensor

629
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:16,798
creative names for sensors and it has

630
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,740
two detectors in it so it gives a

631
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:23,099
reading for par and it gives a second

632
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,740
reading for just this radiation right

633
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:27,740
here and then of course you can add them

634
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,079
together so it gives you three numbers

635
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,339
this reading that reading and the sum of

636
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,259
both of those

637
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:37,019
this is a little bit more money because

638
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:40,919
it has two detectors but allows users to

639
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:42,898
separately measure both of these

640
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,860
and then finally

641
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:46,199
um

642
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:48,719
lots of people want integrated meters

643
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,740
for Daily Light integral this is a

644
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,720
relatively new meter that just it has a

645
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,480
microprocessor inside and it gives

646
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,179
instantaneous

647
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,399
epar and it also integrates the total of

648
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,740
the day you can it stores it in memory

649
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,239
you can get Daily Light integral for the

650
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:11,640
past hundred days with this sensor

651
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,579
which which comes in both of the old par

652
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,200
version and the new epar version of

653
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:18,599
course all of these sensors can be

654
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,058
hooked up to data acquisition systems

655
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,558
they don't have to be hooked up to

656
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,980
meters

657
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:28,678
this is an exciting time

658
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,399
think of people in greenhouses that have

659
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,019
mixes of supplemental light and this if

660
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,178
we don't include this

661
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:39,058
we're going to underestimate the

662
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:42,480
photosynthetic radiation in greenhouses

663
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:45,839
so not only do we feel like there is

664
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,380
solid empirical and theoretical evidence

665
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:52,500
to change to epar

666
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,679
but we've also provided the sensors to

667
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,380
facilitate making that change

668
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,460
thanks for listening we'll catch you

669
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,460
again in the next video
