1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:08,548
I'm Bruce Bugbee president of Apogee

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:12,899
instruments and I wanted to record a

3
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:16,530
video to discuss terminology for

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,589
measuring photosynthetic radiation this

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,830
is real confusing to people and the

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,120
terms have evolved over the last 20 or

7
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,509
30 years

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,980
so since Apogee is in the business of

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,380
helping people make excellent

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,100
measurements of this we want to make

11
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,350
sure the terminology is also clear so

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,239
this is this is going to be a short

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:47,600
video but I want to take you back to the

14
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:51,268
1960s when we used to measure radiation

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,300
only with the Pyron ometer now this is

16
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:55,640
going way back and let me put this curve

17
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,119
over here

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,749
here's wavelength and this is all

19
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:06,658
shortwave radiation and this curve looks

20
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:07,939
something like this fill in that spot

21
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:15,118
right there

22
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:19,649
this is 2,800 nanometers out here and

23
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:22,799
this is about 280 nanometers right here

24
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:28,280
this is all shortwave radiation from the

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:31,799
Sun only this part right here causes

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,899
photosynthesis this is this part right

27
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:39,570
in here and you have to remember what

28
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:43,049
the instruments were like in the 1960s

29
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:46,858
we measured all of this and used it to

30
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,368
predict plant growth but we also knew

31
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:53,809
that this part over here is

32
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:56,849
near-infrared I'm going to put NIR and

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,469
our instruments that included this it

34
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:02,699
was not a good prediction of plant

35
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,769
growth so with this this is PA R right

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,759
here

37
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:07,759
photosynthetically active radiation

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:17,650
this was the first term that we evolved

39
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:21,009
to to say we're only counting P AR as

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,239
the radiation so this is in the 1960s

41
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:28,479
and even into the 1970s this was

42
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,060
everywhere in the literature P AR that's

43
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,568
what we're measuring but what were the

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:41,099
unit's people used the unit's we use for

45
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:44,488
all of this are watts per meter squared

46
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:47,430
total energy this is what drives

47
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,280
transpiration but it's not what drives

48
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,830
photosynthesis this part drives

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:58,930
photosynthesis so we developed this term

50
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:01,690
P AR but we kept the unit's the same we

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,250
said PA R is watts per meter squared and

52
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:04,680
it was an improvement over the whole

53
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,580
thing

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,650
time passes

55
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,860
Keith McCree comes out in the early

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:15,000
1970s and says no it's not the energy

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,730
it's the number of photons that cause

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,930
photosynthesis we need to start counting

59
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:32,250
photons not energy so we evolved from

60
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:36,250
the term P AR to measure this stands for

61
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:43,989
photosynthetically active radiation to a

62
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:45,909
term called P P F now this is an easy

63
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,049
term to remember photosynthetically

64
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:50,079
active radiation

65
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:54,750
this stands for photosynthetic photon

66
00:03:50,079 --> 00:04:00,909
flux and it's a more rigorous term and

67
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:04,719
this in the 1960s and 70s this often

68
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:09,280
meant watts per meter squared which was

69
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:13,989
not very accurate this specifically

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:18,639
meant micromoles of photons per meter

71
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:22,030
squared per second the story would end

72
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,219
here this is a more rigorous term

73
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:28,989
four moles of photons then the old term

74
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:36,970
P AR but language evolves people kept

75
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:41,230
using P AR to mean micro moles per meter

76
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,930
squared per second so it got confusing

77
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,090
these terms were used interchangeably

78
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,209
and they are used interchangeably to

79
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:52,539
this day but we try to use a more

80
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:56,199
rigorous term for just the photons flux

81
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:59,800
now the P stands for photosynthetic that

82
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:03,629
means 400 to 700 I'll write this down

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,730
here if you're going to get a degree in

84
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:08,409
plant science

85
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:12,819
you got to measure 400 you got to

86
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:16,030
remember 400 to 700 both of these are

87
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:26,399
photosynthetic this is up photon flux

88
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:29,079
now what about P P F D is that different

89
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,709
it depends on what part of the

90
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:36,219
literature you read these two terms have

91
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:38,978
been used interchangeably for 50 years

92
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,400
in the literature and they are still

93
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:46,870
used interchangeably today and even

94
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:51,668
during my career as a researcher we have

95
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:56,280
used these interchangeably but we are

96
00:05:51,668 --> 00:06:01,209
evolving now to different definitions

97
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:05,259
how can this the D stands for density if

98
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:07,599
you look up on the Internet the word

99
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:10,209
flux now let me see if we can do this we

100
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,790
go to a next screen I'll come back to

101
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:14,789
that screen flux

102
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:24,740
what's the definition of the flux if you

103
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:28,490
type it in do a Google search you come

104
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:40,240
to the Wikipedia page and it says flux

105
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:40,240
equals an amount a amount per area per

106
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:52,819
time this is micro moles per meter

107
00:06:48,230 --> 00:07:04,580
squared per second if you look up the

108
00:06:52,819 --> 00:07:07,219
flux density this is also micro moles

109
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:10,609
per meter squared per second but it

110
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:15,050
turns out physicists have trouble with

111
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:19,100
the word flux many people define flux as

112
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:27,379
just an amount I'm gonna preheat amount

113
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:31,270
per time and if flux means an amount per

114
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:34,850
time let me put something like about

115
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:39,139
these terms are used interchangeably

116
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:43,939
if flux means an amount per time then we

117
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:50,289
reserved flux density for amount per

118
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:53,350
area per time a.m. T amount area time

119
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,350
[Music]

120
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:10,879
so in my publications starting about

121
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:10,879
three years ago we started to use p p FD

122
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:23,009
instead of P P F when we use PP f the

123
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,290
argument was that the D is redundant and

124
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:28,649
that's the worst case in writing to put

125
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:32,759
redundant things in your writing the PPF

126
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:36,809
was adequate then and but some people

127
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:39,389
were using ppfd separately and i did a

128
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:44,329
big literature survey and it turns out

129
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:47,970
people in plant ecology we're using ppfd

130
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:51,840
people in horticulture and a grinning

131
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:54,269
were mostly using PPF so different

132
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,399
disciplines use this acronym slightly

133
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:59,730
differently you would think that's

134
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,730
horribly confusing but both of them

135
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,620
always showed the units after this and

136
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,139
as long as you show the units you know

137
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:11,539
what people are talking about about

138
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:16,830
three years ago I started using ppfd and

139
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:21,149
what that means is now we can use PPF to

140
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,070
mean just I'm going to see if I can put

141
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:29,699
it right here

142
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:33,750
micro moles per second no no area in

143
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:37,129
this this one for sure has the area this

144
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,129
is area times time

145
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:44,199
so historically these have been used

146
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:48,490
interchangeably but we're trying to

147
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,500
shift the terminology in the literature

148
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,440
this is papers that I review as a

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,470
scientists and both my own writing to

150
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,540
use ppfd the argument now is it's better

151
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:06,000
to be redundant than it is to risk being

152
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:10,199
unclear because d always means area so

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,399
this now we're starting to evolve a

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,220
definition where this just means per

155
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,980
second no area in it that's the

156
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:23,710
difference between these terms so if we

157
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:27,789
go back to this PA R is still used by

158
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:31,600
lots of people in just common speech to

159
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:34,120
refer to a photon flux density but

160
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,840
technically we try and reserve the term

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,149
P AR for a generic term that could mean

162
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,149
energy flux that could mean photon flux

163
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:52,289
ppfd we turn reserved for an amount per

164
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:57,480
area per time and then now we're

165
00:10:52,289 --> 00:11:00,928
starting to use PPF no meter squared

166
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,589
just micromoles per second so in our

167
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:09,198
literature at Apogee you will see when

168
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:12,329
we talk about a flux we will say ppfd

169
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:15,269
maybe it's redundant to some people but

170
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:18,659
it's absolutely clear to have all four

171
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:22,980
of those letters in there an example of

172
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:28,289
this would be let's take a light let me

173
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:35,359
see if we can go one more screen if

174
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:39,778
we're testing some light and this has

175
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:42,089
photons coming out of it if we want to

176
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:47,629
know the total number of photons out of

177
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:53,100
this light we would do a PPF in

178
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:56,129
micromoles per second there's no area

179
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,489
it's a total it doesn't matter if the

180
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,980
photons way over here or in the middle

181
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:05,579
it's a total number of photons this is

182
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,548
important when we're testing it efficacy

183
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:12,328
of the light but if we want to know the

184
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:16,708
intensity at any given place now we have

185
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:18,508
to put the meter squared in here and say

186
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:21,229
this is the intensity because if you

187
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,720
don't know the area you don't know the

188
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,159
amount of light for plant growth and now

189
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,569
when we put that area in there it

190
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,668
becomes ppfd and the D stands for

191
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:36,269
density and that stands for meter square

192
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:45,239
a way to think about this let's try one

193
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:49,698
more screen if we have a box right here

194
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:54,649
man that's a bad box let's see if we can

195
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:54,649
erase that there

196
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:05,860
here's a three-dimensional box like a

197
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:12,849
giant cookie sheet here's our photons

198
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:20,690
coming in like raindrops into this box

199
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:23,420
falling into it if we want to know the

200
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:26,990
number of photons we get we want to know

201
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:29,539
amount of raindrops per meter squared of

202
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,610
box per unit time we defined all three

203
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:35,929
things and now we know the intensity of

204
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:40,850
the rainfall if we just said the photons

205
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:43,009
there was 10,000 photons per second it's

206
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,470
not helpful because we need to know the

207
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,909
intensity we always need to have the

208
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,450
meters squared in there

209
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:53,000
so when you read literature look for the

210
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,370
unit's if the units are correct and they

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,740
should be micro moles per meter squared

212
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,870
per second you will see the older

213
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,610
literature used to call that PPF and

214
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,269
that's fine as long as they've defined

215
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,259
it but we're trying to change this to

216
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,949
ppfd

217
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:13,399
and we have begun using that'd Apogee

218
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:16,629
we've begun using it in science and it

219
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,279
that's the evolution of language from

220
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:21,500
one term that we thought was adequate to

221
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,669
a new term that has more letters in it

222
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,100
to be more precise thanks for listening

223
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:30,459
look forward to talking to you again

224
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,460
soon

225
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:38,229
and one more thing there's a new term

226
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:42,118
that we have started to use in our

227
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:45,899
research remember that this P stands for

228
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:50,079
photosynthetic and that means 400 to 700

229
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:53,428
but we now know these photons out here

230
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,858
let's see if we can put this in red

231
00:14:53,428 --> 00:15:00,818
there's photons right here that we call

232
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:03,160
far red radiation that actually cause

233
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:06,509
some photosynthesis so we're calling

234
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:11,738
into question this whole definition of

235
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:14,459
400 to 700 and even more than that down

236
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:18,699
here let's see if we can do this in blue

237
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:21,219
this is you ultraviolet and these have

238
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:25,688
some effect both on photosynthesis and

239
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:28,389
on plant growth but if we say the ppfd

240
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:31,558
that automatically excludes these

241
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:35,948
because the p means photosynthetic and

242
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:37,928
for 30 40 50 years we've said that's 400

243
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:40,658
to 700 so now we're looking into the

244
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:43,600
future evolution of language and

245
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:52,328
terminology more than language so we

246
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:53,859
have a new term the PE F D just when you

247
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:58,269
thought you had it right here's a new

248
00:15:53,859 --> 00:16:02,199
term this P stands for photons not

249
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:05,979
photosynthetic the photon flux density

250
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:10,028
and when we use this term we are not

251
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:14,799
constrained by 400 to 700 so when we do

252
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:20,278
research the PFD when we're using it can

253
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:20,278
mean 300 to 800

254
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:27,689
so here's a new emerging term that

255
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,460
counts these photons at the edges

256
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,950
doesn't have the extra P in it which

257
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,330
means photosynthetic it's just the total

258
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,290
number of photons watch for it in the

259
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,129
literature it's it's going to be a

260
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,129
useful term
