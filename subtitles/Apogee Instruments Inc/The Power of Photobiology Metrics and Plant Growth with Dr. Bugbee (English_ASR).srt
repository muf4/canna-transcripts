1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,580
I'm Bruce bugbee president of apogee

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,339
instruments and professor of crop

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,559
physiology at Utah State University so

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,439
today I want to talk about our latest

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:17,519
spectral radiometer the features it

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:19,589
gives you for plant photobiology and on

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:26,339
the screen itself of the instrument

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:28,198
[Music]

9
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,539
we have other videos that are like

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,320
owner's manuals of this I'm going to

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,179
focus on interpreting the data from this

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,579
this instrument has got a tiny screen

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,899
right here so you make a measurement

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,539
like this

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,799
and

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,960
instantaneously or within seconds it

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,218
gives you the calculated values in here

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,759
and that's what I'm going to go through

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,200
there are five screens in this and I'm

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,198
going to go through each of them and

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,420
what the values represent here's the

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,420
instrument big it's a model

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,359
MS 100.

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,820
minutes ago I walked outside and took a

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,280
measurement in sunlight that sunlight's

26
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,618
a wonderful reference Spectra so it's

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,379
close to solar noon here in Logan Utah

28
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:16,260
so let's take a look at what these

29
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:19,140
values look like with sunlight

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,299
there's a sunlight Spectra and this

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,299
shows up immediately in the screen if

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,259
this was an LED we'd get a spike of blue

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,780
and fluorescence it it's a immediate

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,420
spectral trace of the light you're

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,879
looking at which is really helpful

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,219
immediately you can interpret a lot of

37
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,158
stuff just from this screen no

38
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,840
downloading of data just just click the

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,000
shutter speed in the instrument and

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,159
collect this so a lot we can do with

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,459
this screen and let me put some units on

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,979
this right away if you're less familiar

43
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,259
with this first of all

44
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:58,319
this tells you something

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,000
let's get a color in here let's put this

46
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,658
in green

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,540
we've got one two three

48
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,280
four tick marks in here

49
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,159
if you're familiar with the sunlight

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,039
Spectrum this is UV

51
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,400
this part right here so it this

52
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:20,400
instrument detects down to 350

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,819
nanometers which is most of the photons

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,980
but the majority of the photons

55
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:28,738
from even from sunlight

56
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:31,139
this then and then the first tick marked

57
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,239
is 400 nanometers

58
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,000
then 500

59
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,599
600

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,878
700

61
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,359
and then out here

62
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,359
is 750.

63
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,579
so

64
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:49,738
this it the subsequent screens tell us

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,140
the amount the number of photons in each

66
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,120
of these categories but first of all

67
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:58,079
four to five hundred

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:02,939
is B for blue photons

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,360
five to six is G for green photons six

70
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:09,000
to seven is red for red photons and then

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,019
this critically important part out here

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,019
700 to 750 is fr

73
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,019
red

74
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,860
so

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,319
UV put that on here one two three four

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,659
five categories of radiation now it

77
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,780
downloads the Spectras you can fine tune

78
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:33,899
this as much as you want but for quick

79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,340
analyzes the fractions of photons in

80
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,539
each of these categories are

81
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,158
particularly important this axis is of

82
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,620
course

83
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,798
Photon flux

84
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,799
foreign

85
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:52,318
that's an F

86
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:56,340
and it's micro moles of photons per

87
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,738
meter squared of area per second

88
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:04,098
and now because this is all these little

89
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,099
tiny bins it's per second per nanometer

90
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,419
is as a specter radiometer gives you

91
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,539
when you download the Spectra to a

92
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,639
laptop or to a cell phone it gives you

93
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,259
more data than this this is just the

94
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,779
screen it shows

95
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,000
that's the opening screen make sure you

96
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,819
got the correct Spectra in there save

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,978
the Spectra now let's go to this so this

98
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,659
is screen number one

99
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:30,418
now let's go

100
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,560
to screen number two and we're starting

101
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:36,779
to parse out these ratios

102
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,339
ppfd as we've talked about in previous

103
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:43,679
videos

104
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:47,819
is PFD is the photon flux density

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,959
and P is the photosynthetic Photon flux

106
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,040
density

107
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:56,459
and this means 400

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,400
to 700 nanometers

109
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:02,399
and this is the classic definition of

110
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,799
photon flux density that we've used for

111
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,339
over 50 years

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,340
sunlight we always say goes up to 2 000

113
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:16,619
micro moles the units over here for

114
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:19,019
these are all micro moles

115
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,819
per meter squared

116
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,279
per second

117
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,620
so this serves with this metric as a

118
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,138
regular Quantum sensor of high

119
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,740
resolution Quantum sensor and we always

120
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,680
say sunlight goes to 2000 well right now

121
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,259
in Utah was

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,500
1948. maybe there was slightly overcast

123
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:44,520
or it's not exactly solar noon but it's

124
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,680
close to two thousand now e this

125
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:52,560
lowercase e stands for extended

126
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,840
photosynthetic Photon flux density and

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,819
what this means is

128
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,299
400

129
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,300
to 750

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,320
that's a seven

131
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,120
nanometers

132
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,219
same units here

133
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:14,300
but it adds the far red photons to this

134
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:17,400
that based on lots of research have

135
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,740
photosynthetic value so it gives us both

136
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,500
numbers now look

137
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,840
1923 this is adding some Far red photons

138
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,279
in the difference would be the far red

139
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,019
photons here

140
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,418
those are actually shown on another

141
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:33,198
screen but this ought to be slightly

142
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:36,659
higher if you measure this under

143
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,280
red and blue LEDs there's virtually no

144
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,620
far red these numbers would be almost

145
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:44,698
the same but if you measure under white

146
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,038
LEDs they have a tail so the eppfd is

147
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,020
almost always a little bit higher and

148
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,139
sometimes much higher if you're

149
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:54,839
measuring lights that have a lot of far

150
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,579
red photons in them

151
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,399
so these are pretty straightforward

152
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,439
we've covered these in previous videos I

153
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,120
won't go into the I won't write out the

154
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,240
full acronym right here

155
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,280
but now there's a third metric in here

156
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,879
why

157
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,779
PFD proton flux density the same as

158
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,779
these

159
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:19,500
the y stands for yield

160
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,818
and this is the metric we've had for 50

161
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,120
years

162
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:28,080
and it does not weight all the photons

163
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,478
equally these do a blue Photon counts

164
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,839
just as much as a green and red they're

165
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,538
all equal that's our definition of these

166
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,159
but we know that particularly blue and

167
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:40,860
green photons

168
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,699
aren't absorbed as well by

169
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,879
photosynthetic pigments as red photons

170
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:50,160
so this metric weights the photons makes

171
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,339
which the red photons more than the blue

172
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,160
and more than the green

173
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,799
and because of that this is always a

174
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,039
number slightly smaller than this

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,139
many researchers report all of these in

176
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:09,659
their papers to make sure you've got all

177
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:12,000
the metrics in theory why PFD is a more

178
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,960
accurate predictor of photosynthetic

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,240
photons than ppfd

180
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,359
um and I and we don't have it yet but in

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,220
theory you can have an eyppfd I'm making

182
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,280
that up just now because that that

183
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,280
doesn't exist yet but this is this

184
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,399
weighted so I'm going to cross that out

185
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:35,278
this is a weighted flux of photons and

186
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,580
it's always about 90 percent of these

187
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,080
because it discounts blue photons for

188
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,919
photosynthesis

189
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,459
finally to round it out t

190
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,439
stands for total Photon flux density see

191
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,599
how this number is higher

192
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,980
this is everything the instrument

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,200
measures and it's 380

194
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,200
to

195
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,720
780 nanometers

196
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
this is all the photons

197
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,000
at the edges of this accounts the UV

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,419
photons in this counts all the far red

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,200
photons and it's a and it's a bigger

200
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:16,079
number

201
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,180
each of these metrics is valuable in

202
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
photobiology depending on the study

203
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,319
depending what you've used but the

204
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
beauty of this is you click the shutter

205
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,459
you take a measurement and you have

206
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
these numbers immediately right there

207
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:34,259
they're stored in memory but you have

208
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:38,879
them right there to to Analyze This

209
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:42,360
is screen two we have five screens

210
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:48,838
screen three puts the these Photon

211
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:51,360
fluxes in categories remember UV is 380

212
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,760
to 400

213
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,879
so there's the flux there's only 38

214
00:09:53,759 --> 00:10:01,080
round this number to 39

215
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:03,299
all of these units are micro moles again

216
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,700
per meter squared

217
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:09,599
per second

218
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,879
so this is sunlight 39 micro moles of UV

219
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,259
photons

220
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,620
B is for blue

221
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:18,778
400 to 500

222
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,240
500 for blue

223
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:23,039
and you can see in sunlight it's a

224
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,860
little more green and even a little more

225
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,860
red that curve goes up here's the green

226
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,580
photons here's the red now if we sum

227
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,060
these up we would get the total Photon

228
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,899
flux if we just added these together

229
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:43,859
we would get the ppfd but this breaks it

230
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,799
down into categories of photons this is

231
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,320
screen three and depending on what

232
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,240
you're doing this is really useful to be

233
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,120
able to immediately see

234
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,980
the number of photons in each of these

235
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,560
categories

236
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,879
screen four

237
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:06,359
this focuses on Far red photons they are

238
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:10,320
such powerful photons there's four

239
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,600
critical metrics for far red photons and

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,959
remember the far red

241
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:22,399
is where am I going to put that is 700

242
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,799
to 7 50.

243
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,679
nanometers this Edge we can barely see

244
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,939
it but it's very very powerful for plant

245
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,639
growth

246
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,740
this is the photon Flux Of Far red now

247
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,958
this could be on the previous screen but

248
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,360
there's four numbers on each screen

249
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,659
so there was

250
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,519
357.5 Far red photons

251
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,600
um in sunlight right now when we made

252
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,740
this measurement

253
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,480
f r f stands for

254
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,180
far

255
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,899
red

256
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,899
fraction

257
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,139
so this is

258
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,139
far red photons

259
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:12,958
over

260
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:16,439
total photons p p f d and in this case

261
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,838
it's e ppfd

262
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,579
so you can see this is a number that

263
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:26,160
goes from zero to one the fraction if it

264
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,319
was pure far red light the numerator

265
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,139
denominator be the same maybe one this

266
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,300
is a very convenient we look for ratios

267
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,240
that are zero to one in all of our

268
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:41,278
science so it's because it's a fraction

269
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:44,820
it's 0.15 if this was a percent

270
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:47,458
we would have 15

271
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,839
.5

272
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,599
percent

273
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:56,420
and that's pretty close to the typical

274
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,420
far red fraction in sunlight

275
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,799
it's a real useful number because we get

276
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,859
so so intuitive was there five percent

277
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:08,519
far red photons was there 20 far red

278
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,399
photons we've used this in manuscripts

279
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,759
Polk assume and I have a manuscript on

280
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,799
the importance of far red fraction it's

281
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,860
becoming very widely used in

282
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,859
photobiology to describe the amount of

283
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,560
far red

284
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,919
PPE is a different metric that's I can

285
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,778
leave this other one up here this one is

286
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:34,799
for phytochrome

287
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:37,860
phytochrome photo equilibria

288
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,778
it's also called I'll put this here

289
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,500
let's see that's even

290
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:46,078
let's switch to Yellow

291
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,839
this is also known

292
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,599
as PSS they're exactly the same thing

293
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,560
this stands for phytochrome photo

294
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,839
stationary State phytochrome

295
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:02,000
photoequilibria same number this is a

296
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:06,060
number that also goes from zero to one

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,980
depending on the amount of far red light

298
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,039
and I'm going to show you a few slides

299
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,339
to explain that in a minute

300
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:16,939
this was 0.69 which means there's quite

301
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:21,360
a few quite a bit of far red

302
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:24,959
photons in sunlight but this weights all

303
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,139
the photons over the entire Spectrum for

304
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:31,379
whether they contribute to um stem

305
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:35,519
elongation or not and stem elongation is

306
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:39,778
largely controlled by phytochrome

307
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:47,179
so we have a final metric on this screen

308
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:47,179
i p p e and i stands for internal

309
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,360
what this means is the predicted

310
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,579
phytochrome effects inside the leaf not

311
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,519
above the leaf but inside the leaf

312
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:05,539
internal to the leaf this is a new

313
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:09,000
metric ippe

314
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:12,539
and our data indicate it more accurately

315
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,299
predicts stem elongation under a range

316
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:17,159
of colors of light then the old metric

317
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:20,458
which was PPE

318
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:22,740
now we show both metrics you can compare

319
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,679
and my colleagues have been putting both

320
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,019
metrics in their papers to predict

321
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,259
things like Leaf expansion and stem

322
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:35,820
elongation but this predicts both now

323
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:38,639
look this is 69 and this one's only 39

324
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,019
so there's a big difference in these two

325
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,299
metrics

326
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,299
and I what I'd like to do is take a

327
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:48,120
little sidebar right now and show you

328
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:51,078
some slides that I showed a few weeks

329
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,600
ago at a big NASA conference

330
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:58,319
to explain the significance of these

331
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,600
metrics for plant biology so let's go to

332
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,440
those slides and we'll come back to this

333
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,440
one right at the end

334
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,980
this is improved metrics for

335
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,259
photobiology this year just slides from

336
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,839
that talk

337
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,838
this is a picture of the phytochrome

338
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:19,260
molecule it's a big organic molecule

339
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,660
with with a lot of proteins in it but it

340
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,659
switches back and forth between two

341
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:29,278
forms depending on the colors of light

342
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:31,078
mostly red and far red so it's great to

343
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,480
think of this as Nature's light switch

344
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,519
because it's it's either on or off

345
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,399
telling the plants you're in the shade

346
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,980
get tall you're in the stun stay short

347
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,578
but it just switches back and forth

348
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,560
between these two and you need a

349
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:48,719
spectroradiometer to calculate which

350
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,719
form it's in and that's interesting

351
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,639
because there's thousands of these

352
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,879
molecules and plants and the plant is

353
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,278
integrating all of these light switches

354
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:03,078
to decide whether it should get tall or

355
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,078
whether it should stay short

356
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,199
here's sunlight this is the significance

357
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,599
of this in it simply in shade

358
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,259
plants have a choice they can avoid

359
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:19,139
shade and get tall or they can tolerate

360
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:22,259
shade and grow more Leaf area now here's

361
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:25,679
a plant in sunlight over here it's short

362
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,838
with small leaves what we can do with

363
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,880
photobiology and lights is Trick these

364
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,279
plants into thinking they're in the

365
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,679
shade so they get more leaves and that's

366
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,200
a wonderful thing it trick them to think

367
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,140
they're in the shade some species get

368
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,538
tall and this is very undesirable

369
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,940
but this is that curve we were just

370
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:48,419
looking at for sunlight measured Under

371
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,840
the Sun here's our Classic 300 to 400

372
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:54,900
506 700 now look what happens in the

373
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:57,599
shape underneath the tree all of these

374
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,019
wavelengths are filtered out and this

375
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,939
far red we better put that in a

376
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,619
darker

377
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,160
darker color

378
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:11,339
this far red right here

379
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,400
is transmitted and it flips that

380
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:17,399
phytochrome molecule to the on position

381
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,259
and it says change shape chain shape

382
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,360
we're in the shade even whether they're

383
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:25,019
in the shade or not we could trick them

384
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:28,319
but in nature this is how it works

385
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:30,480
there's the far red at the critical in

386
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,918
shade

387
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,900
this is the classic ratio of colors that

388
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,820
leads to this metric phytochrome

389
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,220
photoequilibria

390
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,220
and it's a ratio of far red

391
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,080
let's get another

392
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,319
it's really a ratio of

393
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,740
far red over total

394
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,899
foreign

395
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,660
photons and it heavily weights blue

396
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,580
photons and less of red

397
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,779
so with this we've known about this

398
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:09,058
curve for bow 60 70 years

399
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,399
in studies there's I picked one here

400
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,798
from 1976.

401
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,880
this is this PPE as the number gets

402
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,879
higher

403
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,400
stems get shorter

404
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,260
and actually this this is not quite

405
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,019
correct pfr

406
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,460
is response to the red

407
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,798
photons

408
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,380
not the far red

409
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,660
so as this number gets higher more red

410
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,000
light plants get shorter and that's a

411
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,798
pretty good predictor of this so you

412
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,558
measure it and you know the potential of

413
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,619
your light source to make tall plants or

414
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,720
to make Leaves expand okay this was work

415
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:49,139
great

416
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,660
but the phytochrome molecules not just

417
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,620
on the surface of leaves it's inside the

418
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,440
leaves

419
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:57,418
and here's these blue photons where keep

420
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,440
coming back to these same wavelengths

421
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,799
here

422
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,600
blue photons are absorbed by chlorophyll

423
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,579
and other pigments and they don't

424
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,399
penetrate the leaf this is a cross

425
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:12,599
section of a leaf top and bottom blown

426
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,298
up green photons penetrate into the leaf

427
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,759
and this is the transmission here red

428
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,460
photons don't they're absorbed far red

429
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,558
really penetrate into the leaf

430
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,038
so what does the phytochrome molecule

431
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:28,798
actually see it sees the penetrating

432
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:31,200
photons into the leaf

433
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,480
so

434
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,720
when we did tests

435
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,900
on the old this is the old PPE right

436
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,900
here

437
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:47,038
this wonderfully predicts this is a

438
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,538
knife linear relationship stem

439
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,179
elongation

440
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:53,640
when we did that test with

441
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,820
different ratios of colors in the

442
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,460
background blue green and red the lines

443
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:03,960
got all mixed up the the predictive

444
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:08,038
value of PPE was not very good so we

445
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:11,400
have a problem with the PPE under LED

446
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:15,119
lights where there's a mixture of colors

447
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,160
so let's look at the what we did

448
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,879
here's the old curve this by the way is

449
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,400
done with Paul kasuma a PhD student with

450
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,160
me he's now an assistant professor at

451
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,220
waganingan University in the Netherlands

452
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:33,360
this is the paper this came from

453
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,220
here's the original PPE right here

454
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,079
put that in yellow

455
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,100
with the weighting factors that we've

456
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,279
used

457
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:43,079
here's the screening of chlorophyll the

458
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,658
classic screening more green gets

459
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,339
through a lot more far red if we take

460
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,280
this

461
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:53,038
times this

462
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,319
we get this function and this function

463
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,658
is

464
00:21:54,319 --> 00:22:00,658
ippe which your new spectradiometer

465
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,760
measures calculates instantaneously and

466
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:07,440
look at the difference this heavily

467
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:11,460
rates red this heavily weights far red

468
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,980
how well does this newer metric predict

469
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,519
stem elongation under a range of light

470
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,519
sources

471
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,740
very well

472
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:21,839
here's

473
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,679
I

474
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,240
this is the PPE once again same curve

475
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,700
I've been showing you

476
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:35,179
this is PPE with colors and this is i p

477
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,179
p e

478
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:41,339
the new metric with a big background of

479
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,980
colors and the lines converge

480
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:47,819
um so this coupled with other people's

481
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:51,000
studies now indicates internal PPE is

482
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:53,298
just an improved metric more precise for

483
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,859
measuring phytochrome effects

484
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:57,960
considering What's called the spectral

485
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:01,379
Distortion of the leaf the filtering of

486
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,259
chlorophyll into the leaf

487
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,460
that's a lot of slides to derive why

488
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:11,158
ippe is important let's go back to the

489
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:14,038
spectradiometer here's PPE

490
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,980
and ippe one last time

491
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:19,379
we show them both the older metric and

492
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,440
the newer metric and this is more

493
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,320
sensitive to as on a range of zero to

494
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,919
one this is a more sensitive these

495
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:34,079
numbers tend to be all very high on 0.7

496
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:36,120
to 0.9 whereas these numbers are 0.3 to

497
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,639
0.9

498
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,699
this is screen four

499
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,220
we have one final screen

500
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:49,140
this is screen five

501
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:52,620
and these are metrics for human lighting

502
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,259
color rendering index which most people

503
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,839
are aware of it's a number of zero to a

504
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:00,538
hundred the

505
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,720
um closer to 100 the better the light

506
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:05,819
source renders colors for the human eye

507
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,659
the Reds and the greens and the blues

508
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,599
now

509
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:12,260
zero to a hundred this is sunlight and

510
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,918
that's the reference so the color

511
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,919
rendering index

512
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:23,900
foreign

513
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,280
which is an index

514
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,500
um

515
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,720
it usually means that number to zero to

516
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,519
one or zero to a hundred

517
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,640
sunlight's a reference

518
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,259
what's CFI this is the color Fidelity

519
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,220
index

520
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:45,379
this has been called by some people

521
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:50,339
tm30

522
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:55,020
for technical memo 30. it's also called

523
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:58,740
RG but it's an index 0 to 100 so we call

524
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:58,740
it the color fidelity

525
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,200
index

526
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,298
and look under sunlight a hundred it's

527
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,819
it's as good as it gets for color

528
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:15,240
rendering Index this is very close

529
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:17,879
under LEDs this number gives bizarre

530
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,019
values it gives negative values it's an

531
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,080
old index the CFI is a much improved

532
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:27,119
newer index and people say oh the

533
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:30,778
calculations are more complex for CFI

534
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,278
for one this is based on six reference

535
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:36,298
colors

536
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:38,220
this is based on 99 reference colors

537
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,500
that tells you something about how

538
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,538
Superior it is and people say oh the

539
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,538
calculations are so complex oh yes well

540
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:48,240
it takes about a five microseconds to do

541
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:48,839
those calculations in a computer

542
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,640
um

543
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:56,220
so this CFI is replacing CRI and in fact

544
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,559
I would say it's largely replaced it but

545
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,400
this has been around a long time

546
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,798
finally and let's let's see if we can

547
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,179
erase these

548
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,099
um

549
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,700
give ourselves a little bit more room

550
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,699
right here

551
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:18,538
and we'll put this in yellow

552
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:21,960
color correlated temperature

553
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:25,740
is a number between about 2

554
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,298
000 and about seven thousand depending

555
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,579
on

556
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:32,038
really the blueness versus the

557
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:35,158
orangeness of the light

558
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:37,980
now the higher the number

559
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,919
the more blue the light this is sunlight

560
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,919
so it's five thousand so sunlight's very

561
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:48,059
blue light if this was an incandescent

562
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,020
light this number might be about two

563
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:51,359
thousand

564
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,519
and you go to the store and you buy LEDs

565
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,918
and you can buy you can pick whether you

566
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,960
want attempt to simulate an old

567
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,000
incandescent light incandescent lights

568
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,179
about

569
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,538
2500 it's a warm orangish glow

570
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:08,220
we say you put warm colors in your

571
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:11,099
bathroom to make it look like you have a

572
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,679
good tan and cool colors in the kitchen

573
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:14,879
to to be more like sunlight in the

574
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,519
kitchen

575
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,460
so this gives a number from

576
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:24,359
two to eight thousand depending on the

577
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:27,120
blueness of the light and finally the

578
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,819
old classic Luxe

579
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:33,178
which is the human outweighted human eye

580
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,339
response for uh

581
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:40,080
um

582
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:42,259
lumens of light Lux the definition is

583
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,259
um

584
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,980
a lumen

585
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,980
per meter squared

586
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,678
is a is a lux some lights about ten

587
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:59,158
thousand

588
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:03,140
foot candles by the way FC we used to

589
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,140
use those is a lumen

590
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,659
per foot squared

591
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,520
but this is the metric equivalent of

592
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,320
foot candles and we put this in here

593
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,200
just because it tells the brightness of

594
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:19,339
the light for the human eye it does

595
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,440
nothing directly to do with plants

596
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:24,538
these turns out have quite a bit to do

597
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,759
with plants because we want to

598
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:30,000
accurately diagnose subtle differences

599
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:32,579
in color of plants and the higher this

600
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,519
color Fidelity index the better we can

601
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:39,418
see the plants so

602
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:42,200
there you have it five screens first one

603
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,200
is a graph

604
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,778
screens 2 3 4 and 5 are summary metrics

605
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,240
of the light

606
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:56,220
we hope you love this instrument we've

607
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,079
been using it in my laboratory at the

608
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,480
University The Graduate students and I

609
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:04,379
and this is the go-to instrument because

610
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,659
it's so fast and easy to use and it

611
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,460
gives you these ratios right on the

612
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,770
instrument itself

613
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:19,500
thanks for listening
