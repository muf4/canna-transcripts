00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,018
I'm Banga molly i'm an application

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,599
scientist ICT international i'm excited

4
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,449
to meet professor Bruce Bugbee and chief

5
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,700
scientist mark Blancas we've been using

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,920
Apogee instruments for a long time now

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,300
being able to meet them and learn more

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:48,420
about their instrument is really

9
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:51,419
exciting I'm Bruce Bugbee professor of

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,379
crop physiology at Utah State University

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,109
and president of Apogee instruments we

12
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,849
are here at the Hawkesbury Institute for

13
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,350
the environment and Western Sydney

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,359
University to do an all-day workshop on

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,489
principles of environmental measurements

16
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,789
we've done some workshops together

17
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:14,699
before but this is the first in

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,159
Australia and we're thrilled to be here

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,960
this country is coming into spring as

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,939
part of that we want to talk about a

21
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,908
couple instruments that we have been

22
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,758
working on for several years and we're

23
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,759
introducing these instruments in this

24
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,868
workshop one of them is a spectral

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,509
radiometer and it's small compact rugged

26
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:39,959
it's made for continuous monitoring

27
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,899
outside and like any spectroradiometer

28
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,219
it can be mounted this way and a second

29
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,228
one can be mounted up to down so you get

30
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:51,810
reflectance signatures from plant

31
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,519
canopies this is small and lightweight

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,840
it can be flown on a drone

33
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,149
we've been working on this for several

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,020
years and we're excited to be

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:04,960
introducing it at this workshop and

36
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:08,240
tomorrow the videos will show in detail

37
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:17,180
the characteristics of this sensor and

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:19,490
what it can do and applications I'm

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,560
holding a net radiometer like the

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,170
spectroradiometer we've been developing

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,939
this one for quite some time the design

42
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:29,119
goal is when we started were to build a

43
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,729
small compact lightweight instruments to

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,800
facilitate mounting the same time we

45
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:36,409
wanted to build a 4 component instrument

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,490
that was lower cost but still performed

47
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:43,189
or its regards to accuracy compared well

48
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,750
and favorably to the four component

49
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:48,109
instruments already on the market a

50
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:51,080
couple of the design features all of the

51
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,540
signals come into a central analog to

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,550
digital converter and all of the signals

53
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:59,810
are output as sdi-12 so it doesn't use a

54
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,650
number of data logger channels in order

55
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,840
to make the measurement also each

56
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,379
individual sensor has a heater to try to

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,530
keep doing frost off of the detectors

58
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:15,229
and facilitate accurate measurements in

59
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:19,099
all conditions like Bruce said we're

60
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:20,810
happy to be here in Australia to teach

61
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:26,090
the workshop and discuss these new

62
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:28,969
instruments as part of our time so what

63
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,479
a fuses participants in this workshop

64
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:36,129
are PhD candidates so this is a workshop

65
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:38,319
for scientists and looking for new

66
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:41,319
technologies and emerging

67
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,319
instrumentation

68
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:48,259
my name is dr. Peter Cole I'm the

69
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,870
director of ICT international we are

70
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:53,780
proud to be the distributors of Apogee

71
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,219
instruments in Australia in regard to

72
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,110
the principles of environmental

73
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,960
measurement this is truly exciting

74
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,210
because these principles are really very

75
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,980
important things to understand because

76
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,599
they enable you to deploy the

77
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,239
instruments in the right way

78
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,789
collect the right data and provide the

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,409
correct in data interpretation and this

80
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:14,409
is really very important
