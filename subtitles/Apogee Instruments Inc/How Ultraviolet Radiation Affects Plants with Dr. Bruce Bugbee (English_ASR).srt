00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,520
i'm bruce bugbee president of apogee

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,240
instruments

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,919
and professor of crop physiology at utah

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
state university

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,199
in this short video we're going to talk

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,039
just about

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,759
uv photons and what they do to plants

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,079
apogee makes a couple different sensors

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,760
for

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,439
uv it makes a su-200 which is just for

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,599
uv

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,278
some of the extended range now start to

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,399
measure uv

14
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:33,439
and most importantly for uv

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,439
is a spectroradiometer and

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,439
they're more expensive but if you're

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,960
really doing uv research

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,878
you really need to buy the more

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,359
expensive instrument

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,000
now let's take a look at this because

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,920
it's very

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,119
confusing to people here's our what we

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,719
call the electromagnetic spectrum

24
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,479
and the two key points are 400

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,120
and 700 nanometers and this is visible

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,759
light

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,878
and it's been well discussed in previous

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,079
videos

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,719
so we'll just draw a box for this

30
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,840
now as everybody knows these colors have

31
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,000
different effects

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
on plants they're not all equal but for

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,040
photosynthesis

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,960
they're close to equal suddenly

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,560
right at 400 we call this uv light

36
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:28,000
but the wavelengths of uvv are very

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,040
different and so we give letters to them

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,840
and let's put uv in blue

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,840
so if we go to

40
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,399
320 now some people

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,640
say this is 315 nanometers

42
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:50,000
but the the transition right here

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,519
this is called uv

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,319
a and it's just a the letter a because

45
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,599
it's close

46
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,879
to the visible this

47
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:05,118
radiation is leds

48
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:08,959
can produce these this this uv radiation

49
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:12,719
pretty effectively but it is

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,199
much less powerful to a plant

51
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,639
than the next group of wavelengths and

52
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,958
now

53
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,719
i'll show these in blue there's a band

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,319
right here

55
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:28,800
this is b u v b radiation

56
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:31,919
and then finally we get a band down here

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,160
which is uvc so

58
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,199
this is pretty much review for people

59
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,878
that study

60
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:42,719
study uv a is fairly

61
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:47,679
benign b is a lot more powerful and

62
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:51,120
c is really powerful very damaging

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,719
let's take a look at two things how much

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,039
of these wavelengths are in

65
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:59,759
sunlight and how do those photons cause

66
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,479
sunburn because we know that sunburn in

67
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,639
people

68
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,719
is caused by these so let's take a look

69
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,399
at sunlight first i'll put that in

70
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,560
yellow

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,000
sunlight starts this this wavelength

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,840
right here

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,360
by the way is 280.

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,598
below 280 we get all of the

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
radiation from the sun is filtered by

76
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,119
our atmosphere

77
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,759
the sunlight starts here and if we're

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,879
going to make a curve for sunlight

79
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:34,239
it's vanishingly small

80
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:37,359
and get this in yellow here

81
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,719
it's vanishingly small

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,120
and then right about 380

83
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,359
starts to go up and then there's a big

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,640
jump right at 400

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,120
and it curves starts to look like that

86
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,119
sunlight

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,959
so this light little tiny curve on

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
graph like this looks like there's

89
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,000
hardly anything there

90
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,280
but these photons are hundreds and

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
thousands of times

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,239
more powerful than these photons so the

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,639
trace of radiation here is a very big

94
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,239
deal

95
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,639
for light then it starts to jump up

96
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,439
how about sunburn we have waiting

97
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,840
factors

98
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:25,360
for sunburn and let's put those

99
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:29,679
and let's put those in white

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,120
the waiting factors for sunburn start

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,120
very high here and they

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
look like that this is

103
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,839
a

104
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
this is called the erythema response

105
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,759
curve

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,840
and a huge rating factors one photon

107
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,120
in uvb is equal to 100 of uva

108
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,959
it's tremendously powerful for causing

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:07,120
sunburn the glass in greenhouses

110
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:10,079
filters out pretty much all of the uvb

111
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
so if you worked all day inside a glass

112
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,319
greenhouse

113
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,080
the glass is kind of like spf 60

114
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,000
um in in terms of the sunscreen effect

115
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,519
you could get a sunburn inside a

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
greenhouse but you'd have to be working

117
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,599
a long long time to get it

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,079
so these photons are not at all the same

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
big weighting factors and you can see

120
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,758
why you need to know

121
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,680
are you on this curve are you

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,439
right here on the curve you're right

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,439
there are you right there

124
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:47,038
enormously different how does this look

125
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,319
for plants this is the erythema response

126
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,000
curve

127
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:55,439
when we graph this for plants the curves

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,160
look really similar to sunburn

129
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,918
curves there's a series of plant growth

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
curves depending on what we're

131
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,639
interested in

132
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,359
some are dna damage but they all

133
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,478
come down something like this and the

134
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
exact shape is

135
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:15,519
is important but they all exponentially

136
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:19,680
decrease uv

137
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:22,799
is so damaging down here

138
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,639
we want to use it very sparingly

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,439
but up here it can have some beneficial

140
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,800
effects

141
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:33,519
it can help make plants tougher

142
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,960
plants make their own sunscreen so you

143
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,198
give them some uv

144
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,279
they synthesize pigments in the leaves

145
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,199
and they protect themselves against

146
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:46,799
uv photons so that's a beneficial effect

147
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,280
but these photons in here

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,879
that are close to the visible light can

149
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,079
be beneficial to plants

150
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,399
and we can use them in various ways help

151
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,000
keep

152
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,560
plants short help keep them make the

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319
cuticles thicker make the layers on the

154
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,959
plants thicker

155
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,160
the same thing happens here but when we

156
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,359
get into these

157
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,000
we we need to have extremely small doses

158
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,199
we have done research on uvc in our

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
laboratory

160
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,639
and oh my you only have turn that on for

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,399
seconds

162
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
per day and you hope you don't burn the

163
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,198
plants the bee

164
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,719
we've also studied and we've burned our

165
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,879
share of plants with uvb

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
by turning them on one hour two hours

167
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,478
three hours a day and then you start to

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,639
see

169
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,598
burned parts of leaves because the

170
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
plants couldn't

171
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:39,519
adapt to that much a is far

172
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,079
less powerful and we can give them a lot

173
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,879
more

174
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,560
uva so all three of these are

175
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,478
potentially beneficial

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,839
depending on the dose the rule of thumb

177
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,199
is

178
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:56,159
some uv is good for people

179
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
it's just the right amount and some uv

180
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,560
is good for plants

181
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
it's just the right amount

182
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,319
we get so concerned worldwide about

183
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,319
the skin cancer and sunburn we have

184
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,439
everyone's using

185
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
sunscreen guess what the incidence of

186
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,560
vitamin

187
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,159
d went up in the population because

188
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,439
people were blocking all the uv

189
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,240
and we need uv light uv photons to

190
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,199
synthesize vitamin d so it's a powerful

191
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,000
example of some ub is beneficial for

192
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,639
people it's just not too much same thing

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,639
for plants

194
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,240
the let's go to one

195
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:41,439
other screen can i get to another screen

196
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,000
there let's take another screen

197
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,000
and just to get a clean screen here's

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,200
400

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,519
here's 700 same graph uv

200
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,879
the apogee makes the

201
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,720
meter quantum

202
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:03,519
dot sorry this is not right

203
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,759
but i'm getting the wrong model number

204
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:13,200
on here um this is a visible

205
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,399
bit meter the sensor

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,839
uv 200

207
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,080
this is a just a uv sensor and its

208
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,920
response curve

209
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,360
looks something like this it gets mostly

210
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:33,199
uv a it doesn't get any visible

211
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,000
it cuts off in here this is a useful

212
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
sensor

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
but it's you got to couple it with what

214
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,720
types of uv

215
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,159
that it it measures to be

216
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,360
able to separately get uvb

217
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,559
uvc uva and all the weighting factors

218
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,959
then you need a spectroradiometer which

219
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,319
which is a powerful tool on this is just

220
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,599
more expensive

221
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,120
so the sensor is good but it but it

222
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,720
doesn't tell you the exact

223
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,639
wavelengths and of course the other epar

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,839
sensors now

225
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,679
get some of this in here because this is

226
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
beneficial radiation

227
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,759
right below 400 that causes

228
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,600
photosynthesis

229
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:20,799
so i hope this helps as a summary of uv

230
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,879
light in in plants

231
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,240
we really need to know the wavelengths

232
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,360
to be able to tell

233
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,240
whether we can have big doses of a

234
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,240
fairly safe wavelength or tiny doses of

235
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,799
a really powerful wavelength

236
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,079
but we have electric lights to give all

237
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,679
of these different

238
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,559
wavelengths and we are actively studying

239
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,039
these now

240
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,919
in my laboratory at the university these

241
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,679
effects of

242
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:50,799
uv i can tell you our early research

243
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,759
is it's tricky

244
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,719
to get the doses just right because

245
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,480
these are

246
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,759
damaging wavelengths but the goal

247
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,120
is to use them to improve product

248
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,838
quality one of the things plants do

249
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
when they get uv photons is make what we

250
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,279
call

251
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,680
secondary metabolites secondary

252
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,278
metabolites includes cannabinoids it

253
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,319
includes terpenes

254
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,679
it includes vitamins a lot of beneficial

255
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,839
things for people

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,479
so if we can get the doses of uv just

257
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,600
right we have a potential to

258
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,159
improve product quality thanks for

259
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:39,759
listening

260
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:39,759
we'll talk to you again in another video
