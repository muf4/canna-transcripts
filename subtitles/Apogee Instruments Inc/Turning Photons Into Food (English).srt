00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:07,506
I'm Bruce Bugbee. I'm a professor of crop physiology at Utah State University,

2
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:15,478
and this is a seminar about calculating potential yield of any agricultural commodity.

3
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:21,951
It was first developed for fields like this and for outdoor agriculture.

4
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:32,479
But over the years, we have modified this model, which is a series of calculations, to get potential yield in indoor agriculture.

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:41,266
And as we get better and better with indoor agriculture, it becomes increasingly important to understand what the potential is.

6
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:52,274
In this talk, in the next 20-25 minutes, I'm going to just derive the potential yield from what we call first principles.

7
00:00:52,341 --> 00:01:01,216
But first I want to acknowledge the funding agencies for this, and NASA is a key funding agency.

8
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:14,159
They’ve funded the research in my lab for over 30 years, and we've been deeply indebted to NASA for allowing us to keep refining these models.

9
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:18,429
Recently, we also got funded by the USDA.

10
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:28,837
And this is a project, much more applied project, to look at the use of supplemental lighting in controlled environments.

11
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:35,643
This project is called the LAMP project: “Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits.”

12
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:41,915
So this is a very basic research project. This is a very applied research project.

13
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:49,954
And back-and-forth, we zero in on the reality of what we can get for food production in controlled environments.

14
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:56,753
So let's now show you the units of this calculation.

15
00:01:56,753 --> 00:02:00,796
One gram per mole of photons.

16
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:13,400
This is an output from the system. One gram of dry biomass, or one gram of yield, per mole of photosynthetic photons.

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,625
So it's output divided by input, which is the efficiency of the system.

18
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:26,129
Now just quickly I can show you how we derive this--and let's make sure we're on black.

19
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,847
One gram, let's put it right over here.

20
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:50,169
A gram per meter² of ground area per day, divided by a mole of photons per meter² of ground area per day.

21
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,199
And you can see, the meter², the days cancel out, and we get grams per mole.

22
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:05,509
This mole per meter² right here is called the daily light integral.

23
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:11,657
DLI. It's a common measurement, moles per meter squared per day.

24
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:18,277
This is just biomass. This is tricky calculating the exact area because we get guard row effects.

25
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:25,834
But these are the input parameters to this. Now, where do these come from and how can we calculate yield?

26
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:39,086
I want to start by examining what to any plant biologist is the most important equation in the world.

27
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:47,449
Now, when I show this to physicist colleagues, they're pretty sure the most important equation in the world is E = mc².

28
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:57,499
What do you think this is? The most important equation in the world, particularly to any life scientist? Here it is.

29
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:01,426
Equations are inputs, and they go to outputs.

30
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:09,579
Now this is in every single high school biology textbook. It's in every textbook in college.

31
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:19,471
We have 20 courses on college campuses that emphasize this equation. Of course it helps to know what this is.

32
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:24,000
That is carbohydrate, CH₂O.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,380
And this equation, by now you've figured it out, this is photosynthesis.

34
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,240
So now we look at this.

35
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:46,312
This takes a low--let's get a different color here--this takes a low-energy gas, CO₂. We use it to put out fires. And water.

36
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:59,745
Two really simple molecules. Very low energy. And it makes a high-energy solid food and, well, O₂ is rocket fuel.

37
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:07,358
So we get two very high energy outputs from two very low energy inputs. We often we don't think about that a lot.

38
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:13,896
We make students memorize the stoichiometry, but the energetics of this is what's really important.

39
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:26,923
Now, remember the first law of thermodynamics says "energy in equals energy out".

40
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:40,080
Everything has to follow the first law. How do we get two really low input molecules to go to two high input molecules?

41
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:50,737
The answer is, in more advanced books, light. And particularly photons. And particularly 10 photons.

42
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:58,411
This is close to the theoretical minimum number of photons to push this equation across.

43
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:05,766
So, how are we going to derive grams per mole of photons from this 10 photons?

44
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:10,185
Every book has this in it. The advanced books have the photons.

45
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:22,123
This has always disturbed me that it's written like this because it doesn't capture, for our students, the magnificence of this equation and how you get these high energy outputs.

46
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:28,449
So, I would like to propose that we revise the way we write this equation.

47
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,181
Here's the earth… BOOM!

48
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:39,348
Here is our low energy inputs, and here is our high energy outputs. And it's many steps to get up there.

49
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:46,836
And now, how do you get uphill from low energy to high? We bring in those 10 photons… KABOOM!

50
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:55,062
There’s a lot of energy in those photons. Now the energy balances because the 10 photons drive it uphill.

51
00:06:55,062 --> 00:07:09,507
When we calculate the efficiency of this, and efficiency is--I'm going to abbreviate it--I'll write it out.

52
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:18,068
Efficiency of any system is just the output over the input.

53
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:29,385
So the output is carbohydrate, and the input is 10 photons.

54
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:41,344
When we do this ratio, we get 30% efficient, in theory. Here it is. Theoretical maximum 30%.

55
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:45,620
That doesn't sound very good for a theoretical maximum.

56
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:52,437
And engineers look at this and say, “Oh my goodness! 30%? That's all your important equation can do?”

57
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,918
And it's bothered me for a while.

58
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:00,895
So then I thought, wait a minute! I look at the biochemistry, and this is not one big step.

59
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:06,545
This is many, many little steps. This goes to this, and then this goes to this.

60
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:09,461
When we start to add up all those steps,

61
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:21,735
if you assume there's 23 steps, and that's about right, and each step is 95% efficient, now look at the math in this.

62
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:28,836
If we take point .95 to the 23rd power, that's 30% efficient.

63
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:38,119
So we should start thinking about photosynthesis as 23-automated steps, each one's 95% efficient,

64
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:44,889
and out the end we get carbohydrates and food energy.

65
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:54,427
This is where this whole analysis comes from is this equation balancing. Now, let's look at these 10 photons.

66
00:08:54,427 --> 00:09:02,724
That's the theoretical minimum. How close can we get to that when we measure this in a plant?

67
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:13,298
Here's a graph of photosynthetic photon flux density down here. Increasing light, zero is dark, go all the way up to 1,000.

68
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:25,381
And this is the quantum yield. So this ratio, moles of carbon fixed per mole of photons absorbed, is called quantum yield.

69
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:35,022
Remember I said 10? 10 is called the quantum requirement to this. So one over 10 is 0.10.

70
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:41,862
So same thing just different units. Now look at this. We can't quite get to 10, but we get close up here.

71
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:50,100
The type of plant really doesn't matter as long as it's a nice green leaf. Tomato. Spinach.

72
00:09:50,100 --> 00:10:00,480
Different kind of tomato. In this case, Grand Rapids leaf is quite a light yellow leaf, and it had a little bit lower quantum yield.

73
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,302
Now when I say the leaf doesn't matter, purple.

74
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:13,976
Purple leaf lettuce, that is full of anthocyanins, and anthocyanins are a protective pigment in leaves.

75
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:19,828
They absorb solar energy, and they don't fix carbon in photosynthesis.

76
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:29,375
So when we have purple leaf cultivars, their quantum yield is fundamentally less than nice green leaf cultivars.

77
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:36,000
We only get to these very low, very high quantum yields and very low light.

78
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:48,321
So if we're gonna be more real about this, let's assume that we're growing the plants at 400 micromoles. It’s more typical.

79
00:10:48,321 --> 00:11:01,031
And we go up here. And we go across here. And we're at a quantum yield of 0.08 and quantum requirement of 12.

80
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:10,674
So let's take this now and refine our model of grams per mole of photons.

81
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,508
There's 400 µmols.

82
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:23,254
We know that carbohydrate is 30 grams per mole. This is pretty simple.

83
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:33,952
Carbohydrate is 12. Hydrogen adds two. Oxygen adds 16. That's 30 grams per mole.

84
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:49,338
12 moles of photons gives us 30 grams of biomass, and the efficiency of this system then, output over input, is 30 grams per 12 moles = 2.5 grams.

85
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:56,947
This is significantly higher than what we talked about a minute ago is one gram per mole of photons.

86
00:11:56,947 --> 00:12:02,295
What's the difference in this? The key here is that this is one way.

87
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:14,677
When we run this in the light, the first stable product out of photosynthesis is not just carbohydrate, it’s sucrose.

88
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:25,603
If we're only running at one direction, we get sucrose, and even sugarcane is not pure sucrose.

89
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:36,860
We have proteins in plants, lipids, lignin, cellulose, all kinds of things. How do those things get made, if we're running this only to get sucrose?

90
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:46,248
They get made at night, and they get made continuously by running this equation backwards.

91
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:55,232
This direction, and then we get ATP energy.

92
00:12:55,231 --> 00:13:00,342
And that ATP is used to synthesize all the other things in plants.

93
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:04,349
When we run it backwards, we call it respiration.

94
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:16,465
So respiration takes about 40% of this. After we get here, about 40% is run backwards to make everything else in plants.

95
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:28,390
We can measure this rigorously by canopy gas exchange. This is a picture of some of our chambers.

96
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:35,885
They're little transparent chambers. We measure the gases coming in and out. We keep track of all the CO₂ in this system.

97
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:42,858
And we can keep track of the exact number of photons from minute-to-minute.

98
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:50,182
The exact rate of sucrose production, and then respiration. Now respiration runs in the light and the dark all the time.

99
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:56,763
So it's running back and forth. So we never get 2.5 grams of biomass. That would only be sucrose.

100
00:13:56,763 --> 00:14:02,228
How efficient is respiration? 60%.

101
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:11,575
I'm off the edge of the screen, I need to go back--60%.

102
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:17,240
Respiration is net photosynthesis divided by gross photosynthesis.

103
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:24,856
We also call that daily carbon gain divided by gross photosynthesis. That ratio’s about 60.

104
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:27,404
60, how do we get up to that number?

105
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:34,211
Jonathan France was a PhD student with me many years ago, and he spent his whole time studying this.

106
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:40,192
Couldn't we make respiration more efficient? Couldn't we get this higher than 60%?

107
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:50,067
And we eventually did. We got it to like 65%. We couldn't improve it much. Cold nights. Long days. Continuous light.

108
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:54,536
We were close to fixed at 60%.

109
00:14:54,535 --> 00:15:07,707
So now we take 2.5 grams, going this way, times 60% equals, now we're down to 1.5 grams per mole.

110
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:15,341
And we call this number Photon Conversion Efficacy or PCE.

111
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:24,577
So, in the first slide I said we can get one gram per mole of photons. This is 1.5 grams.

112
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:34,363
But this number assumes every photon gets absorbed by the plants. None of them bounce off. None of them hit the ground.

113
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:38,680
100% of the photons get absorbed. And that never happens.

114
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:44,838
Even in a perfect canopy, a few percent bounce off and go back up to the ceiling.

115
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:52,752
Some hit the walls, and even worse, some hit the ground without hitting a leaf and those are completely gone.

116
00:15:52,751 --> 00:16:04,260
To go from this perfect system where we just have photosynthesis and respiration to a real system, we need a little more sophisticated model.

117
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:17,000
And that sophisticated model is called the Energy Cascade model that I've worked on with other people for many years, and we have several papers about it.

118
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,961
Here's the model. Here's our two parameters right here that we're talking about.

119
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:35,163
And in this typical case right here, I'm using 0.06 because if it's higher light levels, we get a little lower quantum yield.

120
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:40,259
But the very first step in this model is fraction of absorbed photons.

121
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:46,304
And we're assuming 80%. This number is more like 50% in typical field production,

122
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:54,000
but with high planting density and maybe systems to move the plants apart, we capture more photons.

123
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:06,811
80% times quantum yield times carbon use efficiency gives us biomass per mole of incident photons.

124
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:10,260
And finally the fourth one is called harvest index.

125
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,288
That's the ratio of usable or edible product to total plant biomass.

126
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:27,087
In the case of lettuce, this number is 80-85%. We don't eat the roots. We don't eat the stem base. Lettuce is almost completely edible.

127
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:36,300
But in typical crop plants, we're at 50%. Wheat and rice. That’d be tremendous if we could get those to 50%.

128
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,525
They're more like 40% typically.

129
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:46,124
So we take this. We get moles of carbon fixed per mole of photons,

130
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:53,581
and now we multiply by 30 grams per mole, and we're down to 0.4 grams per mole,

131
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,782
well below our one gram per mole that I advertised on that first slide.

132
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:06,493
So now let's look at potential. What do we have to do to get this up to one?

133
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:15,986
Here's a set of numbers. If we improve each one of these just slightly. We get that 80% absorbed to 90%, slight improvement.

134
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:26,108
Quantum yield, we get it from 0.06 to 0.08. Low light and--it's one thing to get 0.08, but keep it there over the whole lifecycle.

135
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:31,086
When the plants are old, try to still have this high quantum yield.

136
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:39,966
Improve carbon use efficiency to 0.65. Go to a very high harvest index crop. Multiply these together.

137
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:44,851
Now we're at one gram per mole. There's the magic one gram per mole.

138
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:54,527
This is the potential yield. And in some systems where we very carefully measure this, we can get one gram per mole.

139
00:18:54,527 --> 00:19:01,180
It is not an average, it's a potential. And you've got to hit it every single day of the lifecycle.

140
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,452
Very hard to do, but it's still a potential yield.

141
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:16,193
Most indoor farms that we have analyzed are down around 0.4 grams per mole now.

142
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:24,524
Mostly because they're not absorbing all the light up here. Many of the photons don't fall on leaves.

143
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:36,730
By the way, this quantum yield only is achievable with very elevated CO₂. Like 1,200 parts per million. It's 400 outside.

144
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,449
That causes photorespiration. We can't have that. To get to this number you have to have high CO₂.

145
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:51,983
It’d be much less than this without high CO₂. But we can enriched with CO₂ in indoor agriculture.

146
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:59,065
This approach came from this article right here, “Exploring the Limits of Crop productivity,”

147
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:05,770
that I wrote with my colleague Frank Salisbury about, well 1988, that's over 30 years ago.

148
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:11,725
This particular article helped launch my career as a young scientist.

149
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:17,000
Showing the math, and then showing what we could get to in potential yield.

150
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,038
And of course we did this with wheat and kept track of all those parameters, and that was the basis of the paper.

151
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:35,872
So now let's look, after we calculate potential yield, let's do an economic analysis of indoor ag.

152
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:44,779
We know the cost of electricity. If we know we could get one gram per mole, what's the economics of this?

153
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,330
This is, what I'm going to show you on this slide now is the basis from this paper.

154
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:59,700
It was an article we published in “Nature.” “LEDs for photons, physiology, and food.”

155
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:02,735
This is just last year, 2018.

156
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:13,735
Assuming 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is a sort of a national average, cost of photons as a percent of the market price.

157
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:24,345
So we took the market price as high as we could get. Gourmet, premium quality lettuce. And look at this, 1% and 5%.

158
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:34,087
No wonder people are rushing to do indoor agriculture for leafy microgreens and for lettuce.

159
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:48,259
But, most of the facilities now where we have 5%, they're at more like 30% of the cost of photons as a percent of market price.

160
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:59,712
And that's because the systems are not yet optimized. They can run with 30% energy, but they could get down to 5%.

161
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:03,899
Now, let's look at tomatoes in this system.

162
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:12,186
Tomatoes have a much lower harvest index. You throw away the leaves and stems and roots. You only eat the tomatoes.

163
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:18,765
The tomatoes don't have as much water as lettuce. Lettuce is 95% water,

164
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:24,843
and we only need photosynthesis to grow the 5% that's dry weight. But tomatoes are much harder.

165
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:30,706
When we go to tomatoes we get 18%. It's harder to grow tomatoes than these.

166
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:37,549
Still possible, but boy, we're going to have to have optimal conditions to ever think about growing tomatoes.

167
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:41,596
Now let's look at other vegetables. Let's take broccoli.

168
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:48,980
Lots of broccoli we can't sell: stems, leaves, roots, and broccoli is more dry weight and less water.

169
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,545
And it doesn't command the premium price that lettuce and tomatoes do.

170
00:22:55,545 --> 00:23:03,009
General vegetables, the cost of the photons is equal to the market value of the product.

171
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:09,059
So unless we can find a way to get consumers to pay a lot more for general vegetables,

172
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,534
including things like strawberries, it's going to be very, very difficult.

173
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:19,823
And by this analysis, at 10 cents a kilowatt hour, it's not going to be cost-effective.

174
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:26,642
The electric cost is going to be equal to the market value, and you still have labor. You have depreciation.

175
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:30,701
You have lots of other costs besides the photon costs.

176
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:36,000
Even worse--rice or wheat.

177
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:42,021
The value of the photons is a hundred times greater than the value of the rice and wheat.

178
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:50,579
We are never going to grow our staple crops without sunlight. We need free sunlight to grow these staple crops.

179
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:57,284
One way to look at this—the rapidly increasing cost of photons—is the market price.

180
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:03,038
These are high market price. These are low market price. That's what drives this cost of photons up.

181
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:05,630
And then secondly, the harvest index.

182
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:14,945
These have a high harvest index and it decreases down to 50%. There are tomato lines that are 70%.

183
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:20,569
So we could potentially do a little bit better with tomatoes.

184
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:26,937
The point here is tomatoes are much, much harder to grow though than lettuce in indoor ag.

185
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:35,231
Now let's do an analysis of what we could do--and this is my final set of slides in this talk--

186
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:46,990
what we could do with solar panels and LEDs so that we didn't have to use fossil fuels to get all that electricity.

187
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,683
Let's analyze this.

188
00:24:48,683 --> 00:25:00,221
What we're going to compare--this is sunlight. If we do total energy in sunlight, it's 30 mega joules per meter² per day of total short wave energy

189
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:09,210
and 60 moles of photosynthetic photons per day. Now this is what drives the photosynthesis.

190
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,773
And the first step here is this is what drives solar panels.

191
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:15,011
So let's do this side first.

192
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:23,693
60 moles comes through a greenhouse, 70% transmission. This is a good greenhouse. It's a design goal for a greenhouse,

193
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:30,810
and obviously we get with this we get 42 moles, 70% of this, transmitted to the plant canopy.

194
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:37,220
Now let's analyze this side. First step, photovoltaic panels, 20% efficient.

195
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:48,173
So that's 30, goes to six moles per meter square per day. That is captured as electricity from the sun per meter² of solar panels.

196
00:25:48,173 --> 00:26:01,941
Now we take the electricity. Put it through LEDs. Our very best LEDs can get to three micromoles per Joule of photons.

197
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:04,534
Micromoles of photons per Joule.

198
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:13,024
M is 10 to the six, this is 10 to the minus six, so this is three times six = 18.

199
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:22,935
18 moles of photons delivered to the plant canopy with solar photo takes. And it’s 42 here. This is a bigger number than this.

200
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:35,530
It takes more than two times the area of solar panels to make the equivalent of what we could get in a greenhouse with nothing. Just a glass greenhouse.

201
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,075
So I made a diagram to emphasize that point.

202
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:47,583
This is solar panels in a field. 2.3 acres of solar panels feeding electricity to light up one area.

203
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:55,244
So, we're not there for direct use of solar energy through LEDs.

204
00:26:55,243 --> 00:27:04,432
But, you say solar panels are getting better. LEDs are getting better. Now let's calculate the potential of this.

205
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:14,653
What if we peer into the future and look at what solar panels could be and what LEDs could be. Can we get this ratio better?

206
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:22,209
Here's the same graph potential. Kept this the same, 70%. We might get this higher with special coverings.

207
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:26,423
But let's keep this side the same. Now we go to 30% solar panels.

208
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:31,551
Now these, the stuff we fly on satellites, they're expensive. They're 30%.

209
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:40,311
So it's possible to get these, and at some point in the future, we'll have consumer panels that are 30% efficient.

210
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:52,747
And the reason they're so efficient is they can use energy out here in shortwave energy by layering cells that photosynthesis can't use.

211
00:27:52,748 --> 00:28:01,884
Photosynthesis uses this part of the curve and solar panels, by layering them, can use these low-energy, near-infrared photons.

212
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:04,838
So they get to 30%.

213
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:07,942
Now we've captured nine megajoules of electricity.

214
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:17,586
Now the theoretical maximum. if we had a 100% efficient LEDs, which we're really not going to get there, but we might get to 90-95%.

215
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:24,428
We can get close. 9.7 times 4.7 = 42.

216
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:30,205
So potentially we can have a system where that's 1:1.

217
00:28:30,204 --> 00:28:35,560
The one acre of solar panels feeds one acre of plants and they don't have a greenhouse.

218
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:41,959
Now this is the cost of building a greenhouse versus all these high efficiency solar panels and LEDs.

219
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,369
This doesn't show economic, it just shows energy flow in this system.

220
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:59,874
So one final slide. This is from a recent paper that is now in review with my colleagues, Paul Kusuma and Morgan Pattison.

221
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:06,000
It's called “From physics to fixtures to food: Potential efficacy of LEDs.”

222
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,972
This is peering into the future. These numbers come from the chip manufacturers of LEDs.

223
00:29:13,972 --> 00:29:19,230
Not the ones that make the fixtures, just the ones that make the chip. How good can they get those chips?

224
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,677
Here's the colors we use. We use blues, we use reds, we use far-reds, and we use whites.

225
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:29,376
And cool white is the most efficient of the whites. Look at these efficiencies now.

226
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:36,170
This is watts of photosynthetic energy out, per watt of electricity in.

227
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:42,106
Wow! 88% for blue LEDs. That is really impressive.

228
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:50,426
Whites are phosphor-converted blue. So they take blue with a phosphor, and we get white.

229
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:58,245
So there's some loss in that, and so whites are 80%. And the reds are less, and the far-reds are less.

230
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:05,310
Now this is energy. But remember energy doesn't drive photosynthesis, the number of photons do.

231
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:12,245
So this column is the micromoles of photons per Joule.

232
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:25,795
Let me review this number. This is micromoles per second over joules per second.

233
00:30:25,795 --> 00:30:33,066
And the seconds cancel, so it is just micromoles per Joule, and a Joule per second is a watt.

234
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:36,644
So it simplifies to micromoles per Joule.

235
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:44,513
Look at these numbers, 3.3 up to 4. These are impressive numbers. We don't have fixtures this good yet,

236
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:50,809
but on the horizon we could see where they could get this good for these colors of light.

237
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:56,126
Now I got a final box here that I haven't shown you yet. What's in that box?

238
00:30:56,126 --> 00:31:00,423
If there's efficiency shown this way. Efficacy.

239
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:09,671
What about the cost of these? Which do you think is the most cost-effective, the easiest to make?

240
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:17,362
Most lighting, almost all lighting, is for humans. And so humans need white LEDs.

241
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:24,900
So, the white LEDs are much much cheaper, just because of economy of scale of this.

242
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:34,137
So now let's look at the price. Wow! 1x for whites. And we go to 10x for reds. And 30x for these.

243
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:40,990
These drive the cost of fixtures, that drive the cost of what we're going to do in indoor agriculture.

244
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:48,084
So this is peering into the future and looking at what we can produce.

245
00:31:48,084 --> 00:31:58,372
All of our analysis indicates that leafy greens can be very cost-effective once we get the systems optimized.

246
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:12,256
Tomatoes would be much harder, and things like strawberries and broccoli are extremely difficult to ever produce without free sunlight.

247
00:32:12,256 --> 00:32:17,402
Thanks for listening. I look forward to another video with you.
