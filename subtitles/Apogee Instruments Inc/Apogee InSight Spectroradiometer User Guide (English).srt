3
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:19,282
Hello everyone, I am super excited to visit with you today.

4
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,783
Today we have the Apogee InSight.

5
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:24,853
It's a sweet little handheld spectroradiometer.

6
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:27,455
So let's get into it. Let's open up the case and check it out.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,694
Inside the case we've got certification,

8
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,128
InSight device,

9
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:38,564
soft carrying case,

10
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:40,666
USB cable,

11
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,634
lanyard with lanyard nut,

12
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,201
Modbus adapter,

13
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,369
and power brick.

14
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,237
Let me show you around the InSight.  

15
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:50,540
On the front, we have an LED indicator light and an LCD screen.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,477
On the left side we've got a power button, or a screen change button,

17
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:57,279
a reset button,

18
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,014
the USB port,

19
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:01,014
and a micro-SD card port.

20
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,016
On the back side, we have the sensor cover,

21
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:05,918
slide that open to reveal the sensor.

22
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:08,287
On the top, we have the measurement button

23
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:12,524
and on the bottom we have  the 1/4-20 thread mount, or a tripod mount.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,430
Make sure that before the first use of the  InSight that you charge the device for at least six hours.

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,633
So grab the USB power adapter and  the charging data cable.

26
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,769
Hook them up, plug it into the InSight.

27
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:29,638
The indicator will turn orange when  it's charging.

28
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:32,540
When it's completed charging it'll turn green.

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,112
You can tell it's charging either by the orange indicator light or by the icon with the lightning bolt through it.

30
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,979
The InSight is intended for lab and field use.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,384
As a result, the device is not waterproof,  so make sure you don't put it in the water.

32
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:47,918
Now I'm going to show you how to use the device.

33
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:50,921
To turn it on, press and hold the  power button.

34
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:56,625
The LED indicator light will turn on, and the device will boot up.

35
00:01:57,192 --> 00:02:02,164
If the shutter on the back is closed, it'll automatically perform a dark calibration.

36
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,934
Once that calibration is complete, you're ready to take a measurement.

37
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,206
For a spectroradiometer, it's very important to  make sure that you do a dark calibration.

38
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:17,275
To ensure the highest accuracy of measurements, make sure you do it often,

39
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:21,079
especially when you change environments,  such as temperature or humidity.

40
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,915
To perform a manual calibration with the device powered on, close the shutter,  

41
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,186
and then press the measurement button,

42
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,854
and it'll perform a dark calibration.

43
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,858
Once that's been done it's ready to begin taking measurements again.

44
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:40,061
To take a measurement, point at the target light source,

45
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,362
press the measurement button.

46
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,800
It'll take about eight seconds to perform the measurement. When it's done, it'll beep.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,637
In order to prevent inaccurate data, hold the  InSight in place until you hear that second beep.

48
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:54,671
And now you have the measurement.

49
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:57,508
The screen will show you the spectra data.

50
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:00,243
Press the power button quickly to change screens.

51
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:06,013
The next screen will  show you PPFD and ePPFD, or PAR and ePAR,

52
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:09,918
as well as other various indicators used by professionals in the industry.

53
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:12,318
If you would like to save the measurement data,

54
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,722
make sure you insert a micro-SD card  into the slot before you take the measurement.

55
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:20,992
It'll include all the necessary data, as well as a time stamp.

56
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,995
So make sure you write down your location,  so you can reference it later.

57
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,164
To power off the InSight, press and hold the power button.

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,437
Now we're going to show you how to  connect the InSight to your mobile device.

59
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,507
First, go to the app store, either Android or Apple.

60
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,379
Search "Apogee InSight."

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,050
This is the app you're going to want to download.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,686
At this point, you're going to want to turn on the InSight.

63
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,890
Up in the top right corner you'll see an icon. It'll either be blue or red.   

64
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,258
That'll tell you whether or not your device is connected.

65
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:06,795
If that icon is red, that means your device is not connected, and you need to connect it through Bluetooth.

66
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:10,231
If it's blue, that means the devices are communicating.

67
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:14,034
Once that icon is blue, you're ready to begin taking measurements. 

68
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:18,237
These are the options that are available on the InSight mobile app.

69
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:24,109
The "Browser" feature lets you go through and review different tests and measurements that you've taken.

70
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,545
Press the "Home" icon in the top left corner to go back.

71
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:30,180
To take measurements, let's start with the "Basic" icon.

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,115
From here you can see the different metrics:

73
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:38,487
PPFD, ePPFD (or PAR and ePAR), and the other metrics that are used throughout the industry.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,862
From here, with your InSight turned on, open the shutter and place it under your target light source.

75
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,800
To take a measurement press the rainbow  camera icon on the bottom in the middle.

76
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:06,810
Once it's done, it'll automatically populate the  different metrics that are available on the screen.

77
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:12,480
If you don't see the metric you're looking for, press the gear icon in the bottom right corner  

78
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,180
and click on basic selector.  

79
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,454
From here you can choose from the various  metrics that are pre-loaded on the InSight.

80
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,695
When you're done, press to go back in the top  left corner, and then press it one more time.

81
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,800
If you want to rearrange the  order that these metrics are found in,

82
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,670
take your finger, push down and hold on the square,

83
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,273
and then you can drag it around and rearrange it as you desire.

84
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:45,841
Let's go back to the "Home" screen

85
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,646
Let's look at the spectrum data on this light right here.

86
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:54,581
Click the "Spectrum" icon.

87
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,719
With the InSight under your target light source, press the capture button or the rainbow circle.

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,128
So now this will give you the spectra data on this light.

89
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:15,798
If you want to save or share this data,  press the four squares in the bottom left corner,

90
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:19,867
and from there you can save, share, or open other data.

91
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,403
Let's go back to the "Home" screen.

92
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:26,673
To view the plant-specific spectrum,  press the "PPFD Spectrum" icon

93
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:30,275
This will show you the spectrum that's more conducive to plant growth.

94
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:33,179
Let's press the "Home" button and go back again.

95
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:38,081
The remaining three icons: the "CIE" and the "CRI"  are used in other industries.

96
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:41,451
And because of that, we're not going to go into too much detail in this video.

97
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:45,387
For more information about those,  refer to the user manual in the link below.  

98
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,425
And that's a quick overview on the  mobile application for the InSight.

99
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,429
The InSight has some added features that are  available only with a desktop application.

100
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,100
To get the desktop application, go to the Apogee  Instruments website at apogeeinstruments.com.

101
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:04,036
Scroll down to the bottom,

102
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:09,673
and in the support column, look for software downloads.  

103
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:15,411
And then scroll down until you see the  InSight handheld spectroradiometer.

104
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,382
You're going to click and download  the Apogee InSight software  

105
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,284
Once it's been installed, it should look  something like this.

106
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:25,620
From here you're now ready to connect the InSight. 

107
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,923
So make sure the shutter is closed, and then plug in the device.

108
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,562
When it's plugged in, the InSight will  automatically pop up on the device list.

109
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:40,365
Click on the InSight, and then click connect.

110
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:44,468
It's going to remind you to make sure  the cover is closed on the sensor,

111
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,875
and then tell you that the dark  calibration has been completed.

112
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:55,877
Now you're ready to begin using the  device.

113
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:58,378
Let's go to the "View" mode first.

114
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,583
From here you can view the spectrum.  Turn on your light source,

115
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,420
open the cover,

116
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,989
and then on the top, click the capture button.

117
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,193
This will capture that data and  then display it as a spectrum graph.

118
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:23,532
If you want to save this data, share this data, or  if you want to load other data,

119
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:26,634
use the icons in the top left corner.

120
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:30,872
You can also use continuous  capture to keep capturing over and over again.

121
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,774
If you want to make changes to lights in real time,

122
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:36,109
in the bottom right it shows you the metrics.

123
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,412
If for some reason you don't see the metrics you're  looking for, click on the box in the top right,

124
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,182
and then move them and change them as you want.

125
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,284
Click on the one you'd like to remove.  

126
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Click the only one you want to replace it with,

127
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,289
and then shift it over, 

128
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,923
and it'll move it over.

129
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:56,391
When you're done, hit the green check mark,

130
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,494
and it will update those metrics.

131
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:02,362
Now we're going to go to "Log" mode.

132
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:06,467
In "Log" mode, you can change the different parameters over on the right side.

133
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:11,471
You can set the interval for how long  between the captures and a total time,

134
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:13,772
or you can do it by how many captures are taken.

135
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,507
Let's go change this to seconds.

136
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:24,081
We'll do one every five seconds for a total of one minute,  then you can press the start logging button.

137
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,350
It will begin taking those measurements.

138
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:42,028
[Device beeping periodically as measurements are taken]

139
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,929
You can see they're going to start displaying as they're taken.

140
00:09:45,264 --> 00:10:04,012
[Device beeping periodically as measurements are taken]

141
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,820
If you want to stop before the total interval  has gone through, press the stop button.

142
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,585
Let's go to "Bin" mode now.

143
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:14,354
"Bin" mode isn't something we typically do in our industry,

144
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:19,858
and so if you want to learn more about it, click on the link in the  description below for the user manual.

145
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,192
Let's go now to the "Checker" mode.

146
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:26,396
In "Checker" mode, you can set the parameters  for which you'd like to test the light by,

147
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:29,699
and you can see whether or not it passes or fails those qualifications.

148
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,020
If you notice, you can't change those  qualifications right off, you have to  unlock them.

149
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:39,907
Click the term lock button to unlock  them and from here you can change them.

150
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,418
After you're done changing them, click the lock button,

151
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:56,920
and then you can press the capture button.

152
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,461
You can see that according to these  parameters, this light would pass that test.

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,067
On the left side there are more modes available. Just use the up and down button in the bottom left corner.

154
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,967
Let's go now to the "Transmit" mode.

155
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:19,272
In "Transmit" mode it'll tell you how much  light passes through a material.

156
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:21,941
Click on the standard light to get your baseline.

157
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:33,048
Now grab your test material and put it between the  light and the InSight, and then press test sample,

158
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:41,855
and this will tell you how much light was allowed through, and how that spectrum might have changed over the process. 

159
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,791
The last mode is "TM30."

160
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,194
TM30 is another one of those metrics that  we don't typically use in our industry,

161
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:52,230
but if you want to learn more about it, click in the description below to for the user manual and it'll explain it. 

162
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,932
And that's a quick overview of the desktop application.

163
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:58,302
I hope you've had a chance to see just  how powerful this little device is.

164
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,804
We're excited to see what you'll  be able to do with it out in the field.

165
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:05,040
Leave a comment below with any questions you  have or how you would use the InSight.

166
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,876
Thank you so much for watching, and have a wonderful day.

167
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:16,416
