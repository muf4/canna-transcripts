00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,500
My name is Schuyler Smith here at Apogee Instruments

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,000
and today we're going to talk about choosing the right quantum/PAR sensor.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,500
We're going to talk about what do quantum/PAR sensors measure,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,019
our original versus full-spectrum sensors,

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,618
the difference between all the models we offer,

6
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:18,120
the output options available,

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,000
and then we're going to talk about our USB output options and how those are different.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
First off quantum sensors measure PAR.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,339
PAR is defined as photosynthetically active radiation,

10
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,000
and we measure PAR in units of micro moles per meter squared per second.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,210
These are the five different series we offer. The 100, 200, 300, and 400 series are all in the black.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,060
Now the black head have our original spectral response.

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,840
We have our full-spectrum over here that have the full spectral response.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,820
We're just going to touch on that here in a minute but here are some references for you.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,539
There's a great video from our CEO Bruce Bugbee,

16
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,740
and it's going to be an in-depth explanation of what PAR is.

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,980
You can click on all these links in the comment section below.

18
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:09,060
We have a great link here that talks about the spectral errors by light source.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,100
Again you can click on that in the in the comments below.

20
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:15,280
But that's going to tell you based on which type of sensor you go with

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,299
whether, that's the original or the full spectrum,

22
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,280
based on what type of light you have what type of errors you would expect.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,560
Of course with the full-spectrum, those are going to be pretty small errors compared to the electric or sun calibration.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,140
Then we have a link here as well that just compares all of the sensors together.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,819
We're going to show that table later in this video, but if you want you can just click right there to see that on the website.

26
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,699
Full-spectrum versus original spectral response.

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,100
Now first we need to define PAR as how the plant sees light.

28
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,899
We can see that is the dashed line here from 400 to 700 nm, right here.

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,260
Ideally that is the spectral response a PAR sensor would have.

30
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,400
We're not able to get that with our sensors.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,740
Our original one you can see it cuts on right here, cuts out a little bit of the blue,

32
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:12,379
a little low on blue and then it completely cuts off some of that far red above 665 nm.

33
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,659
With that we calibrate according to sunlight or calibrate according the electric light sources

34
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,039
and we have those two different options available.

35
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,639
Then we came out with the full-spectrum sensor, which more closely matches that PAR response.

36
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:33,179
That one is going to give you much more accurate readings for all light sources.

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:42,260
The SQ-100 series. The SQ-110 is calibrated for sunlight. The SQ-120 is calibrated for electric lights.

38
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:47,899
Electric lights meaning your high pressure sodium, your metal halides, your T5 cool light fluorescents.

39
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,953
It's not great for red LEDs because of that spectral range we talked about on the graph before.

40
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:57,640
It's self powered, meaning you don't need to add an additional power supply.

41
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:03,859
You just need to hook it up to a single ended order differential reading on your logger.

42
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,880
It will give you an output from 0 to 800 millivolts (mV).

43
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,120
Tthat range is equal to 0 to 4,000 micro moles

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,939
so our factor for every sensor we send out, is 5 micro moles per meter squared per second per millivolt.

45
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:18,500
That's for the SQ-110 and -120.

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,419
Again that link right there, it's the same link as the page before.

47
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:32,019
Our SQ-200 series, this just takes that same sensor and amplifies them into a voltage that you can use on your logger.

48
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,159
The SQ-212 and -220: 0 to 2.5 volts (V).

49
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:41,299
SQ-215 and -225:  0 to 5 V. SQ-214 and-224: 4 to 20 milli amps (mA).

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,360
Then the same thing, the SQ-210s are for sunlight and the SQ-220s are for electric lights.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,480
I do want to mention these all need to be powered in order to get that amplified output.

52
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,079
It needs between 5 and 24 V, whatever, you have in there.

53
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,520
If you have 12 V, great it will automatically regulate the sensor and then give the output accordingly.

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,460
These are just some of your applications that you might be using these for:

55
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,599
greenhouse, nursery, growth chambers, under canopies, aquariums,

56
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,079
freshwater and ocean underwater environments,

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,360
and any measurements with your traditional grow lights (metal halide T5, high-pressure sodium).

58
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:29,160
The SQ-300 has the same sensor as the SQ-100 and -200, we just put it in a light bar so you can get your spatial averages.

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,660
310 is for sunlight. The 320 is for electric.

60
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,140
Then you can kind of see the breakdown here. The SQ-313 and -323 is 3 sensors spaced over 50 cm.

61
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,219
The SQ-316 and -326 is 6 sensors over 50 cm,

62
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,360
and the SQ-311 and -321 is 10 sensors spaced over 70 cm.

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,819
You can see you can use it under canopy to see how much light is filtering through given that spatial average

64
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:00,699
or on a bench, pretty much anywhere if you want that spatial average.

65
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:07,680
Again we're just going to touch on that we've just been talking about the original sensors,  the black line for spectral response.

66
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Now we're going to talk about the full-spectrum (SQ-500 series)

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,439
We actually have one sensor in this series, it's the SQ-500.

68
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,149
It has that wider spectral range.

69
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:23,939
The signal itself is much smaller. It's only 0 to 40 mV.

70
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,459
That puts a 100 micro moles per meter squared per second per millivolt,

71
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:32,889
so make sure your datalogger or whatever you're using to read this can read that small signal.

72
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,019
Then the output range is the same,

73
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,939
0 to 4000 micromoles per meter squared per second.

74
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,899
Accurate with all light sources including all LEDs to give you those accurate PAR readings.

75
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:48,339
Again you can see just a couple of applications.

76
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:53,339
Everything that was on there before but especially with all LED lights,

77
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,519
even those narrow bands, it's going to give you accurate PAR readings.

78
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,839
This is that table.

79
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:06,539
What this table shows you is how each sensor measures up to next one or compares with the one before.

80
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,780
Really let's just go across the output here for the sensitivity.

81
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:16,899
You can see 0.2 mV per micro mole per meter squared per second for the SQ-110 and -120.

82
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:21,620
1 mV per micro mole per meter squared per second for the SQ-212 and -222.

83
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:33,720
For the SQ-214 and -224, you can see this is milliamp per micro mole per meter squared per second and that's 0.0064.

84
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,180
Then the SQ-215 and -225 is 2 mV per micro mole per meter squared per second.

85
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,120
The SQ-300 is the same as the SQ-100, where it's 0.2 mV per micro mole per meter squared per second.

86
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,060
Then the SQ-500 that has a really small signal,

87
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,319
0.01 mV per micro mole per meter squared per second.

88
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,199
You can pull this up on the website and look at it yourself see if the specs meet what you're looking for.

89
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,180
The SQ-420 and SQ-520 both have a USB output.

90
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,819
The SQ-420 being the original series the SQ-520 being the full-spectrum series.

91
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,939
It does require a computer or tablet to display the output.

92
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:20,500
One of the really neat things here is you can set it up on the computer, sampling interval and logging interval,

93
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,819
unplug it from your computer and then take it and set it up in this type of application,

94
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:31,471
where you're just powering it and it's going to log those readings that you set up in the head, up to 10,000 measurements.

95
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:38,680
The next time you plug it into your computer you'll be able to take those readings in a CSV file and analyze it and look at it.

96
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,410
I also want to mention that this is written in an open software

97
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,520
so if you're some sort of system integrator or someone who would just like the command codes

98
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,419
to integrate it into your own software, just email us at tech support and we'll work with you on that.

99
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,100
This is just the example of what the ApogeeConnect software looks like.

100
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,720
You can see our instantaneous reading right here and then you can see our reading here.

101
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,627
We're just logging it right on the computer, doing 5 second increments.

102
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:11,500
Then we can see where it's being saved right here in a CSV file.

103
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,819
This is just a couple of applications, just going back through.

104
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:19,219
You can see our sensors here in a greenhouse, where you might use them.

105
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,100
The LEDs where they might be used, out in the field as far as a line quantum.

106
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,420
