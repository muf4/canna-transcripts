1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:05,403
I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments,

2
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:11,734
and today I'd like to give you a brief overview of how we measure surface temperature.

3
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:19,594
Now this is non-contact surface temperature, so it's done with Apogee infrared radiometers.

4
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:27,730
I'm joined in this effort by Mark Blonquist, he and I have worked together on this for many, many years to refine this measurement.

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,868
It's a powerful measurement, but yet quite challenging.

6
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:41,138
And what I especially want to do in this talk is described what the Apogee Instruments' sensor does.

7
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:45,609
It looks like this—here it is with the sensor—

8
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:52,682
compared to much lower-cost sensors. Here's a little one, you can buy these for under $100.

9
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:56,987
What's the difference in research-grade and hobby-grade?

10
00:00:56,987 --> 00:01:04,227
And this is a lot like taking a picture with your cell phone camera versus a professional-grade camera.

11
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:09,340
When you need accurate measurements, you need research-grade sensors.

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,974
So there are seven things in here that I'm going to quickly go through that establish a research-grade sensor.

13
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:20,370
The first one, obvious, is accuracy.

14
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:36,759
And accuracy isn't just a matter of simple accuracy, because if this is the difference between the sensor and the target,

15
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:51,108
any sensor can typically get that right if the sensor is 77°F or 25°C and the target is also 77°F or 25°C.

16
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:53,314
It's not that hard to measure it.

17
00:01:53,314 --> 00:02:02,876
Now try to measure a hot surface or a very cold surface with the cheaper sensor and they have significant errors.

18
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:10,257
So this is a temperature difference down here—temp diff—

19
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:23,961
and we're gonna put plus 30°C, and over here we're gonna put minus 30°C, and this is the error.

20
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,022
So here's a zero error.

21
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:39,906
This is a low-cost, or a hobby-grade sensor. The error looks like that.

22
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:48,073
And these errors up here can be 5°C as these temperatures reach the extremes.

23
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:56,218
So how good is an Apogee sensor? The Apogee sensor comes in right along here.

24
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:08,242
The accuracy specification for Apogee is ± 0.2°C and that's over the entire temperature range.

25
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:13,736
That's an enormous difference. People just do this and they say "this is almost as good as the Apogee."

26
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:21,707
Yes, but you haven't tested it in extreme conditions. So accuracy is a big deal.

27
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:25,853
#2: Field of view

28
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:35,216
All of these sensors—if we put a sensor right here—have a cone-shaped field of view.

29
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,913
Draw it like this.

30
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:44,361
A low-cost sensor has an enormous field of view. It sees the edges, it sees the sky, it sees the ground.

31
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,800
It averages everything.

32
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:55,406
If you really wanted to average everything, that be fine, but typically what you really want to see is a small area in there.

33
00:03:55,407 --> 00:04:06,412
So the Apogee sensors have variable fields of view, but they're typically much tinier, depending on the type of sensor.

34
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:12,247
So you can pinpoint the temperature of a spot, rather than average a big area.

35
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:19,122
This causes a big change in the signal and it's one of the reasons that Apogee has work hard to get this.

36
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:25,740
Some of the Apogee sensors have a rectangular field of view.

37
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,113
It depends on what you're looking at, so there's multiple options for field of view.

38
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:36,305
But that's a big difference between low-cost and research-grade sensors.

39
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:39,552
#3: Spectral sensitivity

40
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:44,737
Here's a graph of long wave radiation.

41
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:49,901
Long wave radiation.

42
00:04:49,901 --> 00:05:03,016
And that typically goes from about 4,000 nanometers—there's a broken axis here—all the way out to 100,000 nanometers.

43
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:09,000
Radiation from a typical blackbody looks something like that.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,314
A low-cost sensor integrates all of this, which would be OK,

45
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:26,062
except there are huge windows in here where water vapor in the air absorbs radiation.

46
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:33,514
So a low-cost sensor partly measures the air temperature and partly measures the target temperature,

47
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:37,017
particularly as you get farther away from the target.

48
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:49,465
For this reason, Apogee sensors—and I'm gonna show this in green—measure only what's called the atmospheric window.

49
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:53,748
A-T-M-O-S window.

50
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,009
In this range right here, water vapor does not interfere with this.

51
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:09,088
The air is transparent when you use a research-grade Apogee sensor, because they're limited to this window right here.

52
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:15,291
Again, it's a smaller signal, so it's harder to measure, but it's important not to measure the air.

53
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,403
#4: Response time

54
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:31,670
If this is time here—let me get that there—signals can look like this.

55
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:38,009
A cheaper signal, and that's a lot of noise.

56
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:46,317
This might be plus one degree and minus one degree and zero is right here in this.

57
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:50,242
So if this signal is bouncing around, what do you do?

58
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:54,739
You do a running average, and I'll show that right here in green.

59
00:06:54,738 --> 00:07:02,270
You might have a running average that looks like that that's much more accurate, but you have to wait to get your data.

60
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:07,673
You have to leave it on there for several seconds to average this.

61
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:16,218
Apogee sensors have much smaller noise over time, so they don't need to do a running average.

62
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:25,033
It can make measurements over short time intervals. Much faster response time. For many applications that's critical.

63
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,526
#5: Emissivity

64
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:41,564
This is a complex topic, but if this is a surface—say the ground—not all of the radiation coming off the ground is emitted.

65
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:54,901
Typically, for many surfaces, we'll say 90% is emitted—this is a parameter usually represented with a lowercase 'e'.

66
00:07:54,901 --> 00:08:01,894
For a surface like this, what happens to the other 10%?

67
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:06,086
That's reflected.

68
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:13,430
So it's averaging—in this room it'd be averaging the ceiling temperature with the floor temperature—

69
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,701
and it's weighted to the floor temperature.

70
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:26,605
Cheaper sensors don't account for this. Apogee mathematically can account for this and correct for problems with emissivity.

71
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:30,274
We'll talk more about this in a more detailed seminar,

72
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:39,823
but this is can lead to significant errors if it's not properly corrected for in the sensor and Apogee sensors allow for that.

73
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:43,879
#6: Durability

74
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,621
A sensor like this is not designed for continuous outdoor field use.

75
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:54,848
The Apogee sensors are designed for year-after-year measurements in the field.

76
00:08:54,849 --> 00:09:05,390
So if you make the investment for good sensors, you sure want it to work and you want it to work reliably through harsh weather conditions.

77
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:10,425
And the seventh, and final one, is the output of the sensor.

78
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:20,366
You have to get the signal accurately to a datalogger, so this is shielded, twisted-pair cable with multiple output options.

79
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:27,616
This comes with SDI-12 options, it's soon to come with Modbus options, Bluetooth options.

80
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:31,498
There's many ways to get the signal from this to a datalogger.

81
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:37,533
Cheaper sensors read it on the sensor, but that's it.

82
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:49,556
So those are seven reasons that research-grade sensors give you better accuracy and better long-term stability than the much lower cost sensors.

83
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,292
Thanks for listening.
