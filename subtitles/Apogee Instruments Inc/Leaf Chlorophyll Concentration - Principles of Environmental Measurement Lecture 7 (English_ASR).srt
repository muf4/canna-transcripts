2
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,038
The next topic, and I'm going to do two

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,278
at once or they're real short. Leaf

4
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,118
chlorophyll.

5
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,759
Like do we have a chlorophyll meter

6
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,280
here? So this is the instrument

7
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:39,359
self-contained digital

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,760
readout. You clamp on a leaf and this

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,399
tells you the amount of chlorophyll in

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:48,960
the leaf which is particularly useful

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,640
for assessing plant health. Um and

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,840
because it's self-contained, pretty easy

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,840
to use. It's a it's a useful instrument.

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,760
Um, this isn't going to read much right

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,599
now because that's I don't know. I can

16
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,518
pass it around. Isn't going to read much

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,519
right now because we don't have a a leaf

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,200
here. But how does this work to uh

19
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,438
measure chlorophyll? That's just all the

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
power

21
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:19,280
buttons. If you hold a leaf up and and

22
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,798
look at it, you can tell how green it

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
is. And if it's a thicker leaf and

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,240
darker green, it's got more chlorophyll.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,599
So just by looking at it, you get a

26
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,438
sense of that. So you shine a beam of

27
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:34,000
red light through the leaf. And if most

28
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:37,279
of that's absorbed, that indicates high

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,519
chlorophyll in the leaf. And if that was

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,040
the case, we'd be done. We'd just shine

31
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,478
light through it. And red is a

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,880
wavelength highly absorbed by

33
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,879
chlorophyll. So we could relate the

34
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,599
transmission of red light to the amount

35
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,239
of chlorophyll.

36
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:57,399
But cell walls and all the cellulose in

37
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,359
a leaf also absorb

38
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:03,680
light. So a leaf with not too much

39
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:07,118
chlorophyll but thick and a lot of cell

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,280
wall material would not transmit light.

41
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:14,479
So we shine two beams of light through

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,039
it. One at 930 nmters, a wavelength that

43
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,840
chlorophyll doesn't absorb at and the

44
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,239
other one that it does. And by ratioing

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,719
the wavelengths, we can separate out the

46
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,159
amount of chlorophyll from all the other

47
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,598
material in the leaf, the structural

48
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,719
material. And it's just it shines

49
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:36,000
through and uh hits a detector and then

50
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:39,039
the leaf gives us a a reading of the

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,080
ratio of those two wavelengths.

52
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,159
This is a

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,000
fairly old

54
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,840
technology that these meters are sold by

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,439
a couple of

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,120
companies,

57
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,039
but it only gives you a relative index

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
of

59
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,239
chlorophyll. If we do this, if we This

60
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,919
would be great if we walked outside. If

61
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,840
this doesn't need sunlight, it's got its

62
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,679
own lights. If we had a leaf, you could

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,680
you could measure it. We can play around

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,480
with it at the break. We can measure

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,920
some of those leaves out

66
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,840
there. It only gives you an index of

67
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,000
chlorophyll. If the reading says 10 and

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
another leaf says five, you conclude

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
that one has doubled the chlorophyll.

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,680
That's not true. That's incorrect

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,479
because it's an index and it's

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:32,080
nonlinearly related to

73
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,598
chlorophyll. So, one of the this here's

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,159
the wavelengths. Let me show you a

75
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,238
couple. This is the

76
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:41,280
classic transmission and reflectance

77
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,759
signature of any plant. A little hump

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
right here in the green, a dip in the

79
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,719
red, and up where all the pigments are

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,479
gone now over here. And that's just

81
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,400
transmission of the

82
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,359
um non-pigmented wavelengths, the

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,039
cellulose.

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,120
Um that's every time we do reflectance,

85
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:08,959
we're looking for subtle changes in the

86
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,959
slopes of these lines. So this just

87
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,840
measures 991

88
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,798
653 and the ratio of these is called the

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,879
chlorophyll concentration index. That's

90
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,120
the the not not in this meter yet, but

91
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,199
this is 7.5. And the bigger the number,

92
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,959
the more

93
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,520
chlorophyll.

94
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:34,319
So now we look

95
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:37,039
at the index for chlorophyll measured by

96
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,599
this meter and the actual chlorophyll.

97
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
You take a sample of the leaf, extract

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
the chlorophyll, measure it in a spectr

99
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,759
photoometer in the lab with the

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
cellulose gone. And these are curved

101
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,240
lines. They're always curved for all

102
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,240
species.

103
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,000
So there's

104
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:04,478
7.5. Here's a difference of

105
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,918
10. This is this is spad units. If you

106
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,079
heard of maybe you haven't ever heard of

107
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,680
a spad meter down here, but that's

108
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,279
another chlorophyll meter. Here's the

109
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,439
index, but the apparent difference is

110
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,918
four and the real difference is only

111
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,199
three. So these are reproducible

112
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,399
differences. So we programmed that meter

113
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,520
in software with

114
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:30,319
equations for multiple species to

115
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,120
linearize this line. So that meter reads

116
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,599
out in moles of chlorophyll per meter

117
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,840
squared of leaf. The real chlorophyll on

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,400
leaf, not an index for it. Um this a

119
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,478
recently released product to do

120
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,758
chlorophyll. And that's how it works

121
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:51,360
with equations in software.

122
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,800
Let's see what my next slide. Ah, so

123
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
these are the species that are

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,639
programmed in and not surprisingly lots

125
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,520
of economic agricultural species. Um, it

126
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,199
also has a generic index for species

127
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:07,758
that um that haven't been precisely

128
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,800
characterized yet. But the difference is

129
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,120
reading out in a physiological unit

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,600
amount of chlorophyll per meter squared

131
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,600
rather than just some index. So for

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,080
physiological studies, we're really

133
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,520
interested in

134
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,639
that interpretation of the data

135
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,560
is interesting

136
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:32,120
because high chlorophyll doesn't always

137
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,038
mean high plant health.

138
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,519
Um, in low light, plants can make a lot

139
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:41,918
of chlorophyll to have dark green leaves

140
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:45,359
to capture every photon they can. Um but

141
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:49,359
its single biggest use in agriculture is

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,000
to look at nitrogen status of plants.

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,280
When plants start to get incipient

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,279
nitrogen stress, chlorophyll is one of

145
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,719
the first things to go and the leaves

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,598
start to get slightly less dark green.

147
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,720
And this meter can detect those and tell

148
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:11,639
people it's time to fertilize your

149
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,759
crop. Our eyes are so keenly attuned to

150
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,478
color that our eyes are great monitors

151
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,199
of color. Any one of us could walk

152
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,120
outside and say, "Hm, these plants are a

153
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,960
little bit more green than these, just

154
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,439
barely, but I can see it." And we would

155
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,079
all agree. So if we picked two leaves

156
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:34,160
and we said, "This one is greener than

157
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:38,598
this." Why would we need a meter if we

158
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,599
can see the difference in color?

159
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,079
Now put them behind your back. It all

160
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,039
changes when it all changes. There is

161
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,038
there's no comparison.

162
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,959
Exactly. You This literally can do this.

163
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,879
You put them behind your back. Now,

164
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,239
which leaf is that? Oh, I can't

165
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,800
remember. Give me the other one to

166
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,160
compare it to. We have no memory for

167
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,038
color. We just have exquisite ability to

168
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,800
compare it. and especially day after day

169
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,519
you're measuring this and you see the

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,560
chlorophyll getting slightly downhill.

171
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:14,000
Um that's the the value of a chlorophyll

172
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,918
meter is and not only does it digitize

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,598
it so anybody anywhere could use the

174
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,719
number but it also has memory for

175
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,719
tracking it over

176
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,720
time.

177
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,918
Um, this

178
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,918
is I might go back to this

179
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,560
slide, this one here, even even this

180
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,679
picture without all

181
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:45,278
this. This is related to remote sensing

182
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,278
because even though this is the

183
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,879
transmission of light going through a

184
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,399
leaf, when you think of the optics of

185
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:55,958
what happens to light hitting a leaf, if

186
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,958
we draw it here,

187
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,000
um here's the

188
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:05,039
cross-section of a leaf with a bunch of

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,360
cells in here. Here's some some light

190
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,360
coming

191
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,360
in the wavelengths. And I might draw

192
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
this this

193
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:19,159
way. The wavelengths that are

194
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,440
transmitted are the same ones that are

195
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:24,000
reflected. So reflectance and

196
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,880
transmission of lights are basically the

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
same process. Once that photon bounces

198
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:34,399
off a surface, some bounces up and some

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,399
bounces down. But this

200
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,278
the signature for reflected light is the

201
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
same for reflectance as it is for

202
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,720
transmission. So they're like mirror

203
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,159
images of each

204
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,800
other. If you use a spectra radiometer

205
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,039
and put it on top, you get this exact

206
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,439
same shape of a curve for reflected

207
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,159
light. This one just works a little bit

208
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,720
better by doing transmitted light. But

209
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:06,719
that principle is

210
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:10,240
uh helpful in remote sensing too for um

211
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,240
measuring reflectance and

212
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,240
transmission. I think that's all I want

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,480
to say about

214
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,320
um leaf chlorophyll. It's a it's a

215
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,120
simple um process. I guess because it's

216
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,240
simple. Um it's it's you don't have a

217
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,120
big learning curve to learn to use the

218
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,120
meters. Um

219
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,560
and like I say, fertilizer companies

220
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,480
sometimes have sold this meter to

221
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,078
growers to help them tell when to

222
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,720
fertilize. Have any of you used this

223
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:48,479
meter? in here in crop

224
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,800
production. They're they're they're

225
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,560
fairly widely used commercially and

226
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:58,719
mostly for fertilization scheduling of

227
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:00,559
nitrogen. I think um turf growers use

228
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,000
device to measure the greenness of the

229
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,879
turf as a sort of

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,399
moisture measure whether it's a signal.

231
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, turf is almost always is doing

232
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,078
reflectance. Pretty hard to do

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,240
transmission and turf leaves are real

234
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:19,359
tiny. But but it's the same concept of

235
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,919
if it's changing color, it it can change

236
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,079
color because of

237
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:28,838
uh moisture stress, too. I said I can

238
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,838
pick it up the instrument before it.

239
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,799
Yes, I agree. But it's mostly because

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,360
the instrument can remember. Yeah, it's

241
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,319
a tiny bit less green than it was

242
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,079
yesterday. And we just, like I said, we

243
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,440
had no memory for color. We just can

244
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:50,399
really finish. Yeah. Yep.

245
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,399
