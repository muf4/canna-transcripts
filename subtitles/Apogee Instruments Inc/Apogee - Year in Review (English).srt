1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,745
The first day of a new job is  always a bit scary...

2
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:15,533
a new company, new people  and new rules.

3
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,657
What have I gotten myself into now.

4
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:30,000
One year later let me show you  exactly what I've gotten myself into.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,900
Over the last year,  I have been part of something amazing.

6
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,863
I have found a diverse group of unique people,

7
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:40,601
each with unique strengths.

8
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:45,524
A team of people who  turn imagination into reality.

9
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:53,734
What starts as an idea  evolves into a physical product,

10
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:57,756
that gets tested, tested again,  and then retested.

11
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,146
Until it's finally ready for the world.

12
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:06,454
Then manufacturing assembles those  products with speed and precision.

13
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:11,876
It takes a lot of time, commitment  and dedication from all the employees

14
00:01:11,876 --> 00:01:14,333
to turn conception into reality

15
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:15,829
and we do it everyday.

16
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:24,127
We help researchers, scientists and businesses  all achieve their aspirations.

17
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:28,503
What we do every day  makes the world a better place.

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,694
At trade shows customers will go out of  their way to come to our booth

19
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:39,800
and tell us how much  they love our products.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,118
Because of your hard work,

21
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:45,887
Apogee has grown and achieved  some amazing milestones.

22
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:51,504
This year we released several  highly anticipated new products,

23
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:53,150
including the Cloudburst,

24
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,689
the Guardian and the Insight.

25
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:58,449
We continue to give our customers quality products,

26
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,412
on time, at a great price.

27
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:05,093
Not to mention we have  a lot of fun along the way.

28
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:17,825
[Music]

29
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:58,258
... and you start to think about what a  company does.

30
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,508
To all my fellow Apogee employees,

31
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,808
Thank you for all your hard work.

32
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,972
We have a lot to be excited for  in this new year.

33
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:08,935
New projects and new goals

34
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:10,533
and a whole lot more fun.

35
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,818
To all the members  of the Apogee team

36
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,556
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
