1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,640
we're working with colleagues at uc

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,439
davis to put genes in plants to produce

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,919
thyroid stimulating hormone

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,678
and this is mostly in lettuce

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,718
and that helps we're hoping that will

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,359
help

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,960
increase bone density in people living

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
in space

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,359
but this is genes that we're inserting

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,599
in the plants to help the plants

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,279
synthesize valuable

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,278
hormones that we're going to need more

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,278
of

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,518
you
