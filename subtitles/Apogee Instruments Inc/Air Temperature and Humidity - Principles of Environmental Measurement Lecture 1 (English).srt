1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,469
I'm Bruce Bugbee.

2
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,899
We are here because I got asked to give

3
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,939
a talk at a conference next week in

4
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,800
Canberra. It's a controlled environment

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,239
conference and that brought us over here

6
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,929
and Apogee's along with Peter's got a

7
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,329
booth there, but we took the opportunity

8
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,579
to come early to talk about

9
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,090
environmental instrumentation. What we're

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,520
going to talk about is really some basic

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,260
stuff and I can see lots of you are

12
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,979
interested in remote sensing and that's on the list

13
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,648
toward the end of hyperspectral imaging,

14
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,590
those techniques, but of course as you all

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,629
know that stuff has to be ground truth

16
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:06,149
and how well do we make the measurements

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,070
on the ground to do that. Now some of you

18
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,789
do modeling and models need good data

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,729
and boy its no surprise to know that a lot

20
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:16,560
of the data we put in models it's not

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,890
the highest quality data, so it leads to

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,849
some problems. Mark and I have worked

23
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,728
together for a long time, on making

24
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,700
better environmental measurements and

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,829
along the way we develop better

26
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,789
instruments, but I teach a class in

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,979
environmental instrumentation at the

28
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,879
university, Utah State University, and

29
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,368
we've done other workshops on this, on

30
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:50,489
these instruments and that's what we're

31
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,559
going to try to get through today and

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
we're going to make it up a little as we

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,459
go because of the timing. We'll try to

34
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,959
get through as much as we can and leave

35
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,609
you with the resources to pursue

36
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:05,280
everything in more detail, at the end of

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,599
this. So, I want to set some of the stage

38
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,989
this is the outline.

39
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,280
We're going to treat this a little like

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,000
a class and we have plenty of these.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,280
We got our first hand out, this is

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,050
just what you see on the

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,830
screen. We'll do our best to get to

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,920
everything in here. I really appreciate

45
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,139
Marcus and the university this is a

46
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:43,229
great classroom, all the high-tech stuff

47
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,399
to present for you. Some of you may have

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,539
seen this quote before but it's

49
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,560
meant as a joke but

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,659
boy there's a lot of truth in this

51
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,629
statement. Everybody believes a

52
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,340
measurement except the guy who made it

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,710
and nobody believes the model except the

54
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,250
guy who came up with the model, and the gist of this is

55
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,669
we ought to be pretty skeptical of

56
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,739
measurement some of these measurements

57
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,320
we're talking about are hard to make. And,

58
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,879
when you're the guy making them you

59
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,530
realize how hard they are to make and then a

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,810
modeler grabs the numbers, and well it's

61
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,909
been shown that this and this. So,

62
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,210
this is a great quote to keep

63
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,870
coming back to as a reference point. Then

64
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:35,430
this quote (I'm going to put

65
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,610
these halfway down so that we can see

66
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,670
the screen just a bit better.) let me a

67
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,179
couple this quote with a parallel quote,

68
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,040
Never believe an observation unless it

69
00:03:52,039 --> 00:04:06,739
can be substantiated with theory.

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,520
Measurements alone aren't going to get us to where we need to be, and models alone aren't going to get us

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,260
to where we need to be. We're going back

72
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:19,159
and forth constantly and people making

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,320
measurements need to be aware of the

74
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,300
theory behind the measurements, so

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,009
you can tell when you're collecting bad

76
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,060
data. People making models need to work

77
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,589
closely with people making measurements,

78
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:36,739
so they could assess the quality of the data.

79
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,019
Measurement skills for starters have

80
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,069
been largely neglected. We talk about the

81
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,629
internet of things we just throw

82
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,639
thousands of low-cost sensors out there and

83
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,430
oh great what a recipe for disaster to

84
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,730
collect a lot of bad data fast. So, if you

85
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,740
understand the principles, which we hope

86
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,319
to review you can tell when the

87
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,110
measurements aren't of the highest

88
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,480
quality and when you should be skeptical

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,600
and hopefully prevent proliferation of

90
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,540
bad stuff. So, these are two general

91
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,460
principles leading to this we're

92
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,259
starting with measurement of air

93
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,120
temperature, just the most fundamental

94
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,480
thing. Everybody puts air

95
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,100
temperature in the models. It's the basis

96
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,390
for all kinds of things and as you'll

97
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:28,879
see one of the key measurements that's

98
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,728
very powerful is surface to air

99
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,449
temperature difference and leaf to air

100
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,459
temperature difference. That's a

101
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,199
powerful measurement because we can tell

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,149
how fast the plants are transpiring

103
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,639
water and Mark is going to talk about

104
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,949
infrared measurements of surface in just

105
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,819
a few minutes. What we found as we pursue

106
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,370
this more and more for irrigation

107
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,668
scheduling and for hydration of plants

108
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:58,310
is our measurements of the surface

109
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,990
temperature were often

110
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,269
better than our measurements of the air temperature.

111
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,509
So, as a company that led us to come back

112
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,269
to air temperature measurements and look

113
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,490
at challenges with doing that and this is

114
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,460
many years. So I'm going to start with

115
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:19,519
air temperature measurement.

116
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:53,929
This is the first slide from a talk about this just

117
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,120
principles of measuring air temperature. Now, we're going to talk about two things

118
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,870
the type of sensor that we use to

119
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,449
measure air temperature and then how we

120
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,529
shield that sensor from radiation. You

121
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,539
think how hard can it be to measure air

122
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,980
temperature but you put a thermometer

123
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,689
out and they almost always read high.

124
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,240
If there's any radiation coming into

125
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,310
that sensor it goes high. It's not the

126
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,290
correct air temperatures. So, now we're

127
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,060
talking about automated measurement so

128
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,920
everything we talked about is automated

129
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,180
hooked up to with data acquisition

130
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,040
system so now we got electronic

131
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,689
temperature sensors and in the history

132
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,730
of whether measurement we have collected

133
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,850
a lot of bad data with higher air

134
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,280
temperatures than really exist because

135
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,679
of radiation hitting the sensor and

136
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,590
going above air temperature.

137
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,759
Let's take a look at some radiation

138
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,139
shields. This is very basic stuff.  You look

139
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,699
at all the weather stations out there

140
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,920
collecting data and the vast majority

141
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,069
have one of these multi-plate shields on

142
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,069
them, and we all pat ourselves on the

143
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,159
back and say yes that shielded the sensors

144
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,980
up inside this and the Sun can' hit it and

145
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,610
the wind blows and cools it off and

146
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,050
we've got a great measurement of air

147
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,040
temperature. That's true if the wind is

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,650
blowing and the Sun is not shining too

149
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,199
brightly, but what happens if the wind is

150
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,649
not blowing fast and the Sun is shining

151
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,409
right on it or if the Sun is coming at

152
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,478
somewhat of a low angle and it comes

153
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,509
right into this thing? These we have

154
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,919
shown in publications can have errors of

155
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,059
3 degrees C, for air temperature. This

156
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,939
is not a trivial error doesn't happen all the time

157
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,480
they can have errors this big. A record

158
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,539
was a place over snow in the mountains of

159
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,179
Utah in the winter where the Sun reflected

160
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,639
off the snow and hit these things. We

161
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,399
measured at 13 degrees C temperature

162
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,879
error with the static shield like this.

163
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,269
Now there're people working on models

164
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:16,819
of snowmelt, if they use that

165
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,430
data their models are way off, huge

166
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:20,750
errors with this.

167
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,879
So what's the solution? Well

168
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,730
manufacturers of static shields work on

169
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,680
different plate configurations and

170
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,589
different designs but they still have

171
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,860
problems when the wind isn't blowing and

172
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,889
wind blowing means three meters a

173
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:41,600
second is enough to minimize the errors

174
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,570
but that's a reasonable breeze.

175
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,100
What about all the data collected when the

176
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,340
wind isn't blowing? The next level up

177
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,399
from this is to go with one of these

178
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,449
kinds of sensors, shields rather, which has

179
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,810
a fan in it, so it's an aspirated shield

180
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:03,289
and now the wind is blowing all the time

181
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:07,069
the sensors inside and protected. Those

182
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,590
are far more accurate. They greatly

183
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,379
minimize these errors. Now we're talking

184
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,929
errors of a few tenths of a degree C,

185
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:20,870
instead of a whole degree C. Great why

186
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,659
don't we just all switch to these, if

187
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:26,360
they're if they're demonstratively more accurate?

188
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,139
The problem is they're expensive and

189
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:33,199
they require power. So if you're at a

190
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,160
remote station with solar power, some of

191
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,480
these shields take somewhere between 250

192
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,720
to 400 milliamps and you start to do the

193
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,570
calculations. You need a really big panel

194
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,210
and a really big battery to run those or

195
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,620
you need AC power and we don't have AC

196
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,220
power so this was the state several years

197
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,920
ago and we said we got to have better

198
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,110
measurement of air temperature so we

199
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,389
started a research project to design a

200
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:07,759
better shield, and that resulted in this

201
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,269
shield here, which has a coanda radius

202
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,500
inlet and we were able to get a shield

203
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,889
that takes 30 to 80 milliamps of

204
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:22,009
power. Its got a variable speed fan

205
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,679
that can slow down if you don't

206
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,329
need the high-speed fan you can slow it

207
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,600
down. The Sun isn't shining you don't

208
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
have to have a fan on so high. So we

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,269
made this aspirated shield with much

210
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,759
lower power and it can be now used on

211
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,950
solar powered station,s and the cost is

212
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,720
considerably less the these. So

213
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,430
that's the shield story. Anytime you look

214
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,259
at temperature data depending on what

215
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,250
you're doing

216
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,850
we ought to be skeptical about the wind

217
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,190
speed at the site if it's a site with

218
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,370
high wind speeds we're probably fine with

219
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,070
the static shields, but if it's a site

220
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,660
that doesn't always have high wind

221
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:13,699
speeds be careful of the temperature data.

222
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:20,581
Question: So, we can have greater confidence in temperature data taken at nighttime than daytime?

223
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:23,689
Bruce: Absolutely, good point. So at nighttime

224
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,209
there's no radiation coming in and that

225
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,989
data should be accurate. John: Cause we're interested in minimum temperatures?

226
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,149
Yes, it's even better if there's some

227
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:37,220
breeze at night but the problem is

228
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,779
greatly diminished at night. In fact that

229
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,208
some of how when we're doing rigorous tests

230
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,279
of these we check to see that everything

231
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,620
lines up at night and that's our

232
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,110
reference and now we wait for the next

233
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,500
day with the sun. But, your

234
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,289
minimum temperatures at which almost

235
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,659
always occur at night are much more

236
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,879
accurate than maximum think of how many

237
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,679
models we have that are min max

238
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,099
temperature from all data stations.

239
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,159
The min is fine and the max is the daily max

240
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,500
everyday is one or two degrees too high.

241
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,028
That's a big error, and that's our data

242
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,948
set that were working with, historic data

243
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:21,159
set but now we know some of our

244
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:27,939
predictions are based on data that has

245
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,630
trouble. So a couple other slides of this. It's the

246
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,600
most widely measured variable. Lots of

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,290
people are studying this problem. 20

248
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,019
peer-reviewed papers in the last 14

249
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,730
years. Here's a bunch of them here, that's just an

250
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,940
example we're gonna make these slides

251
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,279
available as PDF so you're considering

252
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,519
study this stuff in great detail but this

253
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,659
problem is not trivial as evidenced by

254
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,519
the number of people studying it. Most of

255
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,889
these are on on shield designs and they're

256
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,568
academic studies that built the shield

257
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:03,490
to tell you the errors of other stuff, but

258
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,230
they weren't

259
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,159
designed to yield commercial solutions.

260
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:23,079
Question: Obviously there is a lot of moisture on the shields in different evironments. What are the consequences of that?

261
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,060
Bruce: Thank you for asking that. So if we go

262
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:31,299
back to those shields, as soon as you get

263
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:39,309
moisture on a static here which happens a lot if

264
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:41,709
it's raining or misting or fogging or

265
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,830
even at night condensation on the shield.

266
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,440
Now it reads too low because we've got a

267
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,230
evaporative cooling and it's below the

268
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,529
thrue air temperature. That problem is

269
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,110
also diminished by an aspirated shield,

270
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,440
,which is drawing the air through it so

271
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,170
we've seen that a lot when there's any

272
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,579
kind of moisture on the shield you

273
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,320
always get evaporative cooling. By the

274
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,150
way now the Peters got my coffee. I gotta

275
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,709
tell you how fun it is to come to

276
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,629
Australia and drink your coffee its

277
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:18,879
terrific. I love good coffee and this

278
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,279
morning at the hotel and complimenting

279
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,720
them on the great coffee and they said

280
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,430
yeah we visited the united states and

281
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:30,849
your coffee is for shit and it is. What

282
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,590
a joy it is to come here and have you coffee. So I did

283
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,180
reverse order there's shields. Now we're

284
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,519
going to talk a little bit about sensors.

285
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,720
So there's three kinds of sensors that

286
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,190
people can put in shields, and here they are.

287
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,360
Thermocouples, time-honored thermocouples.

288
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,810
They're cheap you can run dozens of them, hook them up

289
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,819
to a data logger. Thermistors and

290
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,330
platinum resistance thermometers or

291
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,300
platinum resistance thermistors these

292
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,039
are the three categories that are

293
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,639
fundamentally used. This is a thermistor

294
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,379
that's super tiny.

295
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,769
So the first point here is small is

296
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,059
always better with a temperature sensor,

297
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,449
because it stays in better equilibrium

298
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,900
with the air temperature. These tiny,

299
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,149
all of these are pretty tiny sensors.

300
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,129
This is only three millimeters we have

301
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,328
to put the old units for people in

302
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,649
the united states on the screen, but these are

303
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,889
all pretty small sensors. Platinum

304
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:45,558
resistance thermometers are long

305
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:47,928
been thought to be the gold standard for

306
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:50,659
temperature measurement. They're very

307
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,759
small signal, but they're the rugged,

308
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,659
they're stable. They're expensive and

309
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,298
they're slightly bigger, and now I want

310
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,818
to show you the problems with platinum

311
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:05,990
resistance thermometers. Thermistors in

312
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,278
our experience are very underrated as a

313
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,068
technology for measuring air temperature.

314
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:16,879
They got a bad rep years ago because if

315
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,769
moisture gets in a thermistor it can

316
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:21,649
cause drift, but if you can prevent

317
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:24,588
moisture from getting inside the sensor

318
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:28,819
not water but humidity then thermisters are

319
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:32,058
very, very stable. And this is an epoxy

320
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:36,079
coated thermistor, that we found to be

321
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,928
very stable and very rugged in environments,

322
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:44,720
and its a much bigger signal. In our

323
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,329
experience this is the sensor of choice

324
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:51,288
compared to PRTs even if cost is no

325
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,929
object at its the sensor of choice, Thermocouples

326
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,990
are the least accurate of the

327
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,638
three they require reference

328
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:01,278
temperatures and they're just the least

329
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:02,929
accurate of the three although they're

330
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,000
cheap you can you can make a lot of

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,538
thermocouples. Small is better.

332
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:16,579
PRTs are not all the same. People

333
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,678
think oh I have a PRT, yeah well what

334
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,070
kind of a PRT? And you could study this a

335
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,769
bit later. There's Class C, B, A, 1/3, 1/10 DIN,

336
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,259
and here's the accuracy

337
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:30,440
specs. So here's this yellow bead that

338
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,620
we'd really liked, and we sell this with

339
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,428
the shields. 0.1 degree C accuracy,

340
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,419
these are the relative costs of these. So now

341
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:43,849
I'm gonna show you a tiny bit of data in

342
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,209
which we compared these two sensors a

343
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,350
Class A, PRT

344
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:51,379
with an epoxy bead thermistor. You can see they have

345
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,809
similar specifications.

346
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,298
How did this come out? Well what we did is put them in a

347
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,369
accelerated aging chamber where

348
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,918
we cycled the temperature up and down, up

349
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,530
and down with high humidity to try and

350
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:05,750
cause failures of the sensor.

351
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,538
Accelerated aging is one of the tests

352
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,429
that any good instrument company runs

353
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,230
and all their sensors. We always try to

354
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,910
build stuff and then we try to make it

355
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,640
fail and we test it and test it until we

356
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,360
see what its limits are. So we do that,

357
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,189
here's the comparison 96 cycles at -20 to +60.

358
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,230
So the water is condensing

359
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,470
and freezing and that. There's the data

360
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,140
over the number of cycles, take them out

361
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,090
and check them. The red lines of the PRTs

362
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:37,908
and the blue lines are the thermistors.

363
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,980
If you look at this data  you say

364
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,029
lets normalize it to zero on day one

365
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,908
and those thermisters were more stable

366
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:51,200
than the PRTs. So its an example of the kind

367
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,840
of testing that we do on sensors

368
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,288
that's led us to use this specific thermistor

369
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:03,640
for air temperature.

370
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:10,159
So this is the story of radiation

371
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,529
sensors and ther is lots of data and lots

372
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:16,190
of tests and lots of sites, but I think

373
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,640
what I'd like to do next for a few minutes is

374
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,270
talk about humidity. So along with

375
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,889
temperature were doing humidity and

376
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,930
whether it's fire forecasting. We

377
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,930
don't specifically sell a humidity probe

378
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,120
but there's many available. They're

379
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,000
getting better all the time. We've got

380
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,099
our favorite sensors, and we've done a lot

381
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:42,109
of accelerated aging testing with

382
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:45,829
humididty probes too. But I'm not so much going to

383
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,889
talk about choices among humidity

384
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,790
sensors as I am with the principles of

385
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:58,789
psychometrics, which means what's the

386
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,279
difference between relative humidity and

387
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,720
absolute humidity? Now I suspect many of

388
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,450
you in here could write it really nice

389
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,330
test question answer to that question,

390
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:15,470
but absolute humidity is what drives

391
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:20,660
pretty much all environmental responses,

392
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,950
stomatal responses and atmospheric

393
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,019
humidity responses, and yet what we

394
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,099
measure is relative humidity. So I'm

395
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,899
going to take a minute to go through

396
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:39,800
this and I've taught this several times.

397
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:22,530
This is the time-honored

398
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:28,019
psychometric chart, and what I find is

399
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,298
modern students have never seen this chart.

400
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:31,769
They do these all the time but they just

401
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,660
type a number in a computer and it gives

402
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,820
them an output and you ask them about

403
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,918
the relationships and they just don't

404
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,150
know. "I don't know the computer

405
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,110
calculated for me." I find that really dangerous.

406
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:47,308
So if you type psychometeric chart in the

407
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:49,649
internet you get thousands of images of

408
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,860
this for different elevations. There's a

409
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,599
chart for low temperature and high

410
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,689
temperature. We're at 1,500

411
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,610
meters in Logan Utah so this is a 1,500

412
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:04,500
meter chart, which is the one I happen to

413
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,359
have but the one for sea level is very

414
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,329
similar. The principles are identical and

415
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:15,058
if you overlay them there's just a

416
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:18,389
small difference so we use this

417
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,650
for an example. There are five

418
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,559
cardinal humidity parameters and if you

419
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,230
know any two of those you can calculate

420
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,349
the other three and on a computer

421
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,449
you can type them in, but what I want to show you is

422
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,538
how to do that on a chart. This bottom

423
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:43,529
axis right here, dry bulb. That's a

424
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,418
manual thermometer. We don't do this

425
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,460
anymore we use electronic measurements

426
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,409
but all the charts still say dry bulb

427
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,140
and that just means air temperature that's

428
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,840
measured with something that's not wet. So

429
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,990
air temperature is the bottom. The next

430
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,558
thing before we had fancy electronic instruments.

431
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:04,230
The second thing we measure was wet bulb,

432
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,890
and this is a sling psychrometer and if

433
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,020
you're older you know these things and

434
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,000
people keeping like slide rules. Whip

435
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
them out you need to know the humidity

436
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,830
and swing it.

437
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,308
So one of these gets wet and one is dry,

438
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:19,750
and you have to swing this pretty good

439
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,009
for a couple minutes.

440
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:28,680
What do you think the humidity is in here?

441
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,214
Question: Relative or absolute?

442
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:31,778
Bruce: Relative because this can't calculate absolutely, right?

443
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:34,929
This is going to be a little tricky and

444
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:37,000
guess what this is an old one that reads

445
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,679
out in those ancient units called

446
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:48,669
Fahrenheit. So we're at 64 Fahrenheit. My chart is in celsius, we're going

447
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:56,110
to convert. We're at 75 F. So were 24

448
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:00,638
celsius in this room 23 Celsius and we

449
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:12,009
are at 17, wet bulb 17. Let's calculate the

450
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:14,648
humidity with this. By the way, see these are so

451
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:17,408
slick, see how nonlinear this chart is

452
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:21,159
the old guys know how to use slide rules.

453
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,480
You're getting really old if you

454
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
still know that. This is an example of a

455
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,559
slide rule because you put the wet and

456
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,178
dry bulb in here and slide it and it'll

457
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:30,788
tell you the humidity, no batteries, no

458
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:32,740
computer. I just love these old

459
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,159
instruments. How do we find this on a

460
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:44,860
chart? The wet bulb temperature is read up

461
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:47,048
here on this line, and what did we just

462
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:52,210
say? Let's find it. 24, so right there is 24,

463
00:25:52,210 --> 00:26:01,028
and 17 theres 15, 16, here's 17 wet bulb.

464
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:09,130
From this line, we go up, straight up from

465
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:15,870
this, here. We come in at a diagonal, here.

466
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,759
There is our point on the graph for what we just measured.

467
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,980
We're getting 52% humidity

468
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,680
and if i would have swung this

469
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,090
longer this probably would have come

470
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:44,659
down, but you get the idea. It's the

471
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,390
intersection of those two points for

472
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,330
humidity. So now we've entered two things

473
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:52,849
wet bulb and dry bulb and we calculated a

474
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,490
third thing. The relative humidity is these

475
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,930
curved lines, that's where I'm getting

476
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,000
52%. Now what else can we tell

477
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,930
from this? Dew point temperature, the

478
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,930
temperature at which water condenses on

479
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,019
a surface on a leaf, anything. You pull a

480
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,359
can of beer out of your fridge and put it in your room and

481
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,759
water condenses on it because it's

482
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,000
below the dew point. Dew point on this

483
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,150
chart is read sideways, going over here

484
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:35,720
and it's the second scale, or its read this way.

485
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:57,950
So dew point is read sideways. Dew point

486
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,049
right here, the dew point in this room

487
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:04,579
10, 11, 12, 13, 13.5 degrees. Any

488
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,500
temperature below that water will change

489
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,900
state and condensed. Above it it'll never

490
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,850
happen, and you can read it either

491
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:16,519
direction. So now we have dry bulb, wet bulb,

492
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,490
relative humidity, dew point temperature,

493
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:30,349
and the final parameter that we want

494
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:35,240
to know on this is the absolute humidity

495
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,660
of the air and that's also read on this,

496
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,810
on this scale here. It says absolute

497
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:44,210
humidity. This is in grams per kilogram

498
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:48,650
and it's 12 grams a little less than

499
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:54,470
12 right there.

500
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,859
There's an example of two inputs

501
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,479
and you can tell how any two of these

502
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,759
you always get a point and then you

503
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,369
calculate the other three

504
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:10,729
parameters from this. Here's the key

505
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,890
thing now we just did absolute humidity

506
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,790
it's the mass or the moles of water

507
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,240
vapor and air the absolute density not

508
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,269
the relative, but here's the key thing

509
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:26,809
that this if we're calculating rate of

510
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:29,929
evaporation from a surface what we want

511
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,160
to know is the absolute humidity

512
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,330
deficit or the vapor pressure deficit.

513
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:41,210
And we calculate that in computers and

514
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,670
models all the time. We can get that from

515
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,090
this chart. In this room, at this

516
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:50,209
temperature we keep growing up here to

517
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,419
this line.

518
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,889
This is a hundred percent humidity in

519
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:58,298
this room.

520
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:01,599
This is the actual humidity. Now let's take

521
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,719
that side ways to get the absolute

522
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,350
humidity and it's a point right there,

523
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:16,748
and it looks like this is 23 and I'm

524
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:19,839
going around this off to 12. So the

525
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,849
deficit in this room is 23 minus 12 and it's

526
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:30,248
this this line right here. That's the

527
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:33,519
absolute humidity deficit in this room

528
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,409
or out wherever you measure this thing.

529
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:39,100
This is what drives evaporation and

530
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:41,378
transpiration. It is not relative

531
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:45,099
humidity. You can ask the question if we

532
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:49,089
had a wet dish rag here and we wanted to

533
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:51,459
calculate how long it would take to dry?

534
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,249
This is one of my favorite test

535
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:56,139
questions because you can trip students

536
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:58,748
up all the time. In one case we're going

537
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:03,249
to put it at 80% humidity but

538
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:09,038
30 degrees C, and the other case the

539
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:11,319
other way around 80% humidity

540
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,980
in 30 degrees C or we're going to put it

541
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,409
at 60% humidity and 15 degrees C.

542
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:22,960
They said well it will dry faster

543
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,710
in the lower humidity. No it won't.

544
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,169
60% humidity down here has this

545
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:32,200
big of a deficit and over here 80%

546
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,259
humidity is a bigger deficit. So

547
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,868
humidity interacts with temperature to

548
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:42,009
create this vapor pressure deficit, which

549
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:45,730
you can see from this chart. You don't need

550
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,278
the whole chart that's why this subset

551
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:50,798
is in here. Here's the curve and the

552
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,489
equation for a hundred percent and if

553
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:56,619
you know relative humidity, which is what

554
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:59,349
we usually measure, you can multiply the

555
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:01,928
saturation by the relative humidity and

556
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:02,700
then you can

557
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,519
easily calculate this without the chart

558
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,400
because you always got a

559
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,650
point on this chart and here's digital

560
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,590
values for that line. That's

561
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:18,539
psychometrics in 10 minutes or so, and I

562
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,460
find that useful to have a good

563
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,440
understanding of that, intuitive

564
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,390
understanding so you can get a sense of

565
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,150
when people collect that data and how to

566
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,030
use humidity data to put it in

567
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:35,220
units that we want to understand. I think

568
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,120
I'll stop here except for one brief

569
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,519
comment. We put wind on here in the

570
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,250
first section and this is a separate

571
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:53,160
category of measurements. We all measure

572
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,890
wind with cup anemometers that's so

573
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,240
common but an emerging technology is

574
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,049
sonic anemometers, which I don't have a

575
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:08,039
picture of them here but there they

576
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,720
measure wind speed by the speed of sound.

577
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,230
Historically those have been

578
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,390
about $1000 for the

579
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,700
instrument and the cup anemometers are

580
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,730
$300-500 US, that ballpark, half the

581
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,230
price, relative. Sonic anemometers are

582
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,890
getting cheaper and they're more accurate,

583
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,080
and they're particularly more accurate

584
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,299
because at wind speeds below a half a

585
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,700
meter per second the cups stop turning

586
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,500
and that just read zero and there's never

587
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,140
really a zero. Sonic anemometers go all the

588
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,710
way down to zero. So this is another

589
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,230
example of the march of technology

590
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,269
making measurements more accurate and

591
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:54,680
prices are coming down.

592
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,430
I don't think we're going to see a

593
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,440
switch overnight to sonic anemometers

594
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,740
but in some locations with low wind

595
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,960
speeds sonic anemometers are the

596
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,660
instrument measurement of choice

597
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,119
if you need to build models in places

598
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,549
where there's not high winds.

599
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:20,030
That's all I want to say about wind speed. Any questions, some of you have been asking questions?

600
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,250
Question: You mentioned the types of

601
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,780
instruments that measure temperature.

602
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:32,179
How about humidity?  Some things I've done, it's always

603
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:36,349
related to the humidity measurement. It's

604
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,489
related to the temperature. What exactly measures the humidity?

605
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:45,821
What is the device or material?

606
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:48,230
Bruce: Good question.

607
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,329
There is different ways to measure humidity but by far the

608
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:52,099
most common one is what's called a

609
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,250
capacitance probe. It looks like a like a

610
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,739
fat sharpie. They're roughly this size.

611
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:03,349
In the end of this is a chip that

612
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:08,360
changes the capacitance based on the

613
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,849
adsorption and desorption of water vapor

614
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:13,699
molecules, that's the fundamental physics

615
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:20,599
of how it measures humidity. It's been

616
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,179
around for 20 years, 30 years and they've

617
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:24,799
gotten better and better.

618
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,180
Then alongside of that is a

619
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:33,529
temperature sensor. It does those two

620
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,210
things that's why I did psychometrics,

621
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,550
temperature and humidity together give

622
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,650
you the whole package for this deficit.

623
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,059
Remeber I said small is better? Look how big that is.

624
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,690
These can have bigger errors in a static

625
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,389
shield because there's not the wind

626
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:53,779
cooling off the sensor so we like

627
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,760
to have a separate temperature sensor

628
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,130
and then calculate the humidity from

629
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:06,619
this. This heats up because of the

630
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:10,609
radiation hitting it even inside a shield so you

631
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,370
would go, man you know my humidity is not

632
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,500
great because that sensor is a little

633
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,849
hotter than it should be.

634
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,739
Here's something you can see from the

635
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,579
psychrometric chart.

636
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,759
These errors of heating of this tend to be

637
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,800
self-correcting. Let's say the humidity is

638
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,250
52, the true humidity is 52 in this room and

639
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,199
we are measuring with this and the sun is shining

640
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,919
on it and it heats up. As it heats up it

641
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,220
goes this way but the humidity goes down,

642
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:43,079
automatically goes down because it's

643
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,289
heating up and the absolute humidity

644
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,809
tends to be self-correcting.

645
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:53,400
The humidity is wrong, the temperatures wrong but they're wrong

646
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,710
in the same direction and this data

647
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,990
point moves horizontally on this graph

648
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:00,029
somewhere over in here because most of

649
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,350
the time what we want to know is that

650
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,349
absolute humidity. Not sure this is

651
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,228
exactly your question?

652
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:08,460
Question: I have this problem because the temperature is not calibrated very well

653
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,900
so the humidity is wrong, but then I wonder if there were different types

654
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,539
in the same way there are different types of

655
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,820
materials used for the temperature or if there are

656
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,940
different things. I understand that most

657
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,909
of the humidity sensors will use this chip?

658
00:37:29,909 --> 00:37:35,960
There's no other?

659
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:44,009
Bruce: Yeah, no there are other ways you can do absorption and some really expensive ways to measure humidty.

660
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,083
Question: But something that's average and commercial?

661
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,360
Bruce: This is by far the dominant way.

662
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,480
We can talk later about differences among brands.

663
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,619
The biggest thing we see your stability of these. You know

664
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,659
get them out of a box and all of them are

665
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:04,149
good, and now you check them again a year

666
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,059
or two later for drift and and that's

667
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:09,489
where we see differences among types.

668
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:16,359
Yeah, it's a combination of

669
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,210
this and this is another reason I like

670
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,740
this chart because you can see what

671
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,319
happens if you go this way its self

672
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,260
correcting error. John?

673
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,640
Question: You said what drives transpiration and evaporation is more absolute humidity, but I think in the Penman-Monteith equation they use relative humidity. So does that make any difference?

674
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:47,219
Bruce: Do you rember that Mark?

675
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:48,561
Mark: Yeah, I can answer this question.

676
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:51,949
What they are doing in Penman-Monteith is a routine

677
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:55,519
application like in a datalogger for example.

678
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:58,339
So I know Campbell Scientific dataloggers really well

679
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,480
so I use that example.

680
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,159
You just go input the weather

681
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,018
measurements that are necessary into an

682
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:08,899
instruction that they've already pre-programmed into Campbell Scientific

683
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,528
software and the input there is relative

684
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:15,380
humidity and temperature, but in actuality

685
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,039
the pre-programmed instruction has some code

686
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,528
running in the background that's calculating

687
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,568
the absolute humidity just like Bruce

688
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:27,798
explained. So the Penman-Monteith equation itself uses

689
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,318
the vapor pressure deficit which is

690
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:33,349
absolutely humidity minus actual humidity

691
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:36,859
of the air but a lot of times when you see

692
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:38,929
the equation in a datalogger instruction or

693
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:42,918
sometimes as its explained maybe in a  textbook they

694
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:45,600
always talk about the measurement you make is relative humidity.

695
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:50,430
That's because sensors that we have measure relative humidity.

696
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,190
Bruce: We don't have sensors to do absolutely

697
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,490
humidity we always calculated from

698
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:02,519
that data and sometimes it just shows up on the screen but the

699
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:10,199
fundamental physics is the absolute humidity.

700
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,009
Just a quick comment. That's why greenhouses have controlls, to contoll for the humidity deficit.

701
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,380
Yeah excellent and it's calculated

702
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,789
in the background by the

703
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:22,920
microprocessors and in the greenhouse.

704
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:32,360
That's one of the wonderful advances of the march of technology, to do that.
