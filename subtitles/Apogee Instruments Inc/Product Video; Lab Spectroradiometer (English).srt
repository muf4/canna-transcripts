00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,859
Hello my name is Schuyler Smith and I do technical sales and support here at Apogee Instruments.

2
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:11,138
And today we’re going to talk about the Lab Spectroradiometers - our PS-100, PS-200,

3
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:16,839
and PS-300 units. Before I get into the overview, I know a lot of people do troubleshooting

4
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:21,689
watching these videos. So I just wanted to point out how to get to our support page.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,331
And so you click on “support” up in the corner from www.apogeeinstruments.com, and

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,739
then you’ll click here on the icon that shows both our versions of spectroradiometers,

7
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:36,219
and that’s going to take you to our spectroradiometer page support. And so you’ll see you’ll

8
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,390
be able to find the manuals there and the spec sheets, and I’m going to refer you

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,620
back to this as well because we’re going to cover a lot of information fast in this

10
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,709
video. And so if you have any questions that you need to go over again I’ll refer you

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,819
back to the product manuals or the frequently asked questions (FAQs) I think are probably

12
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:58,210
going to answer and address your questions. So, this video is going to cover the common

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,710
applications of spectroradiometers, the differences between the models, setting up the instrument,

14
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:10,269
demonstrating the software, and then just how to export that to excel sheets – exporting

15
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:18,179
those graphs. So, what does a spectroradiometer do? Well, it gives you the intensity of light

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,370
at each wavelength. So it gives you that curve so you know how much red, how much blue, how

17
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,840
much green, there is in a light, and it’s graphing it for you. And so our model allows

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
you to take that intensity and then apply that to a unit of measurement. So you can

19
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,920
see the amount of Photon flux and the amount of energy flux density readings. That’s

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,070
PAR in µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ or Watts m². You can also do transmittance measurements and

21
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,409
the reflectance measurements. And reflectance measurements are really cool. We have here

22
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,739
this reference where it gives all these different things that you can look at as far as NDVI,

23
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,489
PRI, Red edge NDVI (rNDVI). Once you know the intensities at these wavelengths, you

24
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:06,000
can use these various formulas to get your chlorophyll content, your carotenoids, and

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,229
all these other things that these studies show. And so we have that reference there,

26
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,989
and it’s also below in the comments. And you can email us as well if you’re curious

27
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:23,950
about this particular page. So, PS-100. PS-200. PS-300. What is the difference? Well, it really

28
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:30,718
comes down to range and wavelength resolution. So we can see we have our sensitivity across

29
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:38,658
the first row here: the PS-100 350 to 1150 nm, the PS-200 190 to 850 nm, and the PS-300

30
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:44,370
220 to 1100 nm. So the visible light range that usually most of the time we’re concerned

31
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,680
about with plants is 400 to 700 nm. So you can see any of these three will cover that

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,030
range. But the difference is in the wavelength resolution. For one, the PS-200 has the finest

33
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:01,829
resolution out of all of them. Whereas the PS-300 covers the highest calibrated range

34
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:09,510
from 300 to 1000 nm. And then the wavelength resolution on the PS-100 is great, it has

35
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:15,810
1 nm resolution, it just doesn’t go as far down into the UV as the PS-300 does. They

36
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:21,829
all have the same detector type, but then the grating is a little bit different on the

37
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,319
PS-200 and the PS-300—you can see it’s that same holographic aberration-corrected.

38
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,479
And of course you're welcome to dig deeper into exactly what the holographic and aberration-corrected

39
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:38,718
means. It just it helps you get that finer resolution. And they’re all 16-bit units.

40
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:44,389
So, I’m going to put this up here as the written instructions, and then we’re going

41
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,068
to demonstrate this here in a little bit after we do the set up. But I just wanted to have

42
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:52,328
this up here for troubleshooting if anyone is trying to get their unit going. The first

43
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,299
two steps of every measurement: 1. Set the integration time. The integration time is

44
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,110
like the shutter on a camera. It controls the amount of light hitting the detector.

45
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,269
So, if there’s too much light it saturates the signal and it doesn’t allow you to get

46
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,769
a correct reading, and if there’s too little light then it doesn’t have enough light

47
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,769
to clearly take the readings to see what you’re looking at. So, the way the integration time

48
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,959
is set is in “View” and “Scope” mode. And you do have to sometimes play with that

49
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,019
so that you get that integration time dialed in so that it’s maximized and correctly

50
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:34,339
giving you the output. Once you have that integration time set, then it’s step two.

51
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:42,269
But first, this is our example of integration times. We have here the integration time looking

52
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:48,370
great. You can see that it maximizes right there, whereas over here you can see it’s

53
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,220
saturated. It flat lines across the top. So that means your integration time is too large

54
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,690
– you need to bring it down. And that’s straight out of the manual there if you need

55
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:05,370
another reference on that. Once we have the integration time, then we go to the dark scan.

56
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,110
And the dark scan is done by simply taking the dark cap, putting it over the top of the

57
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:18,610
detector here, and then we click the dark bulb here. And that essentially zeros out

58
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,129
the unit so that then it gives us a flat line. So once we do those two things, then we can

59
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:30,699
actually have a useful reading. Alright, so let’s go ahead and cover the demonstration

60
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:38,000
on how to look at the measurements as well as how to set it up. When the unit comes to

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,569
you, you have the head, the cap, the fiber optic cable here, then you have the unit itself

62
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:52,658
– the spectroradiometer unit—and the USB cable along with the base. So, when it comes

63
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:58,779
you can go ahead and hook up the USB. You can screw on the fiber optic to both sides.

64
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,939
If yours doesn’t come with it in here, you can screw the top off here and screw on the

65
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:08,680
fiber optic to the unit underneath here. And we’ll show that unscrewing that off here

66
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,098
in a little bit when we do our reflectance demonstration. So, our unit is here. It’s

67
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:21,269
set up. Now let’s talk about the software. It comes to you on a little USB jump drive,

68
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:26,538
and so here is the information it comes with right here. There’s a couple ways to do

69
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:31,378
this next step. The way I’m going to show you is to take all that information on the

70
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,189
USB jump drive and save it onto a folder onto our desktop. So right here I’ve just saved

71
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:40,879
all the information right here onto my desktop. And then I’m going to run the install from

72
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,560
this one as opposed to running it off the jump drive. It’s a little bit of a preference,

73
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,399
but I find it works great. So once we’re here, we can now run the software. And we

74
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:57,429
get to that… we’ll close out of our jump drive… let’s open it off of our desktop

75
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,319
version. So we know our desktop is saved on our C drive. “StellarNet Software 5.33”

76
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:12,509
– we’ll double click on that. Go to “SWUpdate-Install” so we’ll click on that. It will ask if you

77
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:19,050
want to run this, you say yes, and go through a few steps there. Now the software is installed

78
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:26,189
on your C drive. Now the next step, once we have that one done, is we need to get the

79
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:32,139
64-bit driver installed. And the way you do that is you come back here to kind of the

80
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:40,319
home screen here on our jump drive. We go to “SWDrivers 13” and then we have “SWDriver64.”

81
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,870
And so we’re going to run this, and if we right click on it, and we want to “Run as

82
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,230
administrator.” Get in the habit of right click “Run as administrator” it’s what

83
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,810
makes the StellarNet Spectrowiz software work the best every time. So we right click “Run

84
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,980
as administrator.” It’s going to say do you want to do this, you say yes. It’s going

85
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,310
to come up with this screen. That’s exactly what we want. Everything is fine. So we hit

86
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,668
okay. Now what that has done is it installed the install instructions onto the C drive.

87
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:18,279
So if we come over… let’s open up another windows file explorer here – I just right

88
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,849
clicked on that—and then I’m just going to come right up here to “File Explorer.”

89
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,749
Open that up. And then I’m going to come down here to my “C” drive, “OS (C:)”

90
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:33,360
drive. And then I’m going to look for one that says “SWDriver64” and it’s right

91
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,918
here. So it’s in alphabetical order in mine. So once I open up this folder, it’s going

92
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,059
to have these, which are the drivers, and it’s going to say install it. Yes, I want

93
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:49,129
to install this. So the way I do that is I right click “Run as administrator” and

94
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:54,879
then when we run it say do you want to do this? We say yes. And then here it tells you

95
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,250
the same thing “Run as administrator,” “Total attempted: 1,” “Number successfully

96
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,429
imported: 0.” Mine says 0 because it’s already installed on mine. If yours says 0

97
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:06,439
it’s probably already installed, or you can see if there’s something wrong. But

98
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,520
yours should say “1” of “1” and that means that it was done correctly. Alright,

99
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,389
and then you’ll also notice if it’s done correctly because then the USB down in the

100
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,360
corner will start recognizing the device, and the green light will come on. And that’s

101
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,509
how you know the 64-bit driver is installed. Next step of setup is getting the calibration

102
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:35,110
files moved over, so let’s close this folder. And let’s go back to home on our jump drive

103
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,110
here. And we have the “sw” “sw1.icf” folders. These are our two calibration folders/files

104
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,990
right here. Those are our two files. So we need to move those underneath the program

105
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,470
files for StellarNet. So, again I’m going to come down here – there’s a couple methods

106
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,570
to do this – but I will just go ahead and right click here, open up another file explorer,

107
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,300
and I’m going to go to my C drive, and I’m going to go to “Program Files” – just

108
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:06,870
plain “Program Files,” and then I’m going to go to “StellarNet.” And again

109
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,529
it’s right up here is the directory if you’re looking for that. And then SpectraWiz. And

110
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:18,309
this is the folder I need to move these to. So I come back over to my “StellarNet Spec

111
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:26,578
Jump Drive.” I have my files here. I’m just going to highlight them with “shift”

112
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:31,838
and then we can copy them or you can drag and drop them. It says “Move to SpectraWiz”

113
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,970
and that’s exactly what I want to do. So I just dragged and dropped them over here.

114
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,220
And it says you need to provide this to move this folder, and I say sounds good, continue…

115
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,970
continue. So move those two folders over to our program files “StellarNet.” So we

116
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:54,750
are all set there. So now we’re set up and we’re actually ready to look at the software

117
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:01,059
and open that up. There’s a couple ways to do this, but I like this method. I just

118
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:10,888
find it here in my program file. It’s called “Swd.” I will right click on it and come

119
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:15,409
to “Run as administrator.” So let’s do that. It says do you want to do this? And

120
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:23,919
I say yes. So now it has our signal, the first thing we’ll notice is we do see the curve

121
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:31,689
here, and we’re seeing light coming in. And I’m not going to go through each individual

122
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,260
icon around here. There’s some important ones here – here’s that dark scan one

123
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:40,389
we were looking at here a minute ago. But the important things we should recognize as

124
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:49,220
we’re setting up here first is our value and our time because that’s our set integrator

125
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,230
detector time here and our value just kind of shows us that it is seeing some counts.

126
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:03,139
But before we go deep into that, let’s talk about initial set up. What we can look at.

127
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:08,959
So, in our initial set up, we click the “Setup” up here and we have a lot of information here,

128
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,379
and again refer to the manual for a lot of it. “Detector integration time” we’re

129
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,570
going to talk about that here in a minute. But before, just to make sure everything is

130
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:23,230
set up correctly, let’s come down here to “Interface port and detector.” So let’s

131
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,120
click there, and let’s just verify that everything is correct. “CCD 2048” if you

132
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,528
remember from our spec sheet on the PowerPoint slide that is what all three of our units

133
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:39,730
are. That is correct. “USB2-EPP cable” that is how we’re connected. “LT16 Digitizer”

134
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,170
correct. And “BLUE-Wave Spectro.” All of those are checked. So it automatically

135
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:48,599
recognized that from plugging it in, so we’re set there. So we’ll exit that set up. We’ll

136
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,459
come down here. The next thing we’re going to look at is “Unit calibration coefficients.”

137
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,909
And it should’ve already recognized these units as well, but let’s just check. So

138
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:02,198
we click on that. Now where do I find the calibration coefficients for my unit? They’re

139
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:08,379
actually right on the bottom, and you’ll see where it says “C1,” “C2,” “C3.”

140
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:12,070
So right now it says “Select channel 1” and I hit “enter” and it’s going to

141
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:18,399
give me a number that matches C1 exactly. I hit “enter” and C2 is going to match

142
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:29,440
C2. And C3 is going to match C3. C4 is 0 because there is no fourth calibration unit. Alright,

143
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,410
so we know that that is all set up. Now the other thing you may notice when you’re first

144
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:38,750
setting it up is that you get a lot of warning messages. So you can turn that on and off

145
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,879
right here in “Setup,” “Warning message enable.” And so sometimes they’re helpful

146
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,980
when you’re learning the unit to walk through but sometimes you find them just in the way.

147
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,079
So you can turn those on and off as needed. So, let’s go through our first steps of

148
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,059
each measurement. The first one is setting the integration time. We’ve got to get the

149
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,328
integration time up to here. The first thing we can do is we can use this little slider,

150
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:09,419
and we can slide this out. And we can see it jumped up there. And it changed our integration

151
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:14,339
time to 852 down here. It doesn’t look like quite enough. I can maximize out our little

152
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:21,330
bar here and it says 1000 ms. That’s not quite to the top here so our sliding bar isn’t

153
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,910
going to get it done. So we come over here to “Setup,” “Detector integration time,”

154
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:34,838
and let’s just type in 1500 to see if that is too high or if that’s right. So that’s

155
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,959
pretty close. We’re closer. Let’s see if we can go a little bit higher. So let’s

156
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,919
go “Setup,” “Detector integration time,” 1700, and again it takes a little bit of experimenting

157
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,469
so that you can get this. It pops up and then it always comes right back down. So that looks

158
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,940
pretty good. We’re pretty close to the top without touching it. We don’t see a flat

159
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,149
anywhere. Alright, so our next stage, now that we’ve set the integration time, is

160
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,250
the dark scan. So we’ll want to take the cap. Put it on top of the unit so it looks

161
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:11,659
like that. We see it drops down here, but we see a few little noise spots. So we click

162
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:17,969
the dark scan… and then it drops to 0, and we saw the value go to 0 as well. And that’s

163
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,420
how we know it successfully took a dark scan. And it saved it. And then we open that up,

164
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:28,059
and it pops up. A little bit smoother on a couple spots, but it is showing us what the

165
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:34,739
light is that we’d expect. Now if we wanted to, you can do this drag and drop if you want

166
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,629
to cut your wavelengths down. Like let’s say we’re only interested in 350 to, let’s

167
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:48,870
say, just above 800 nm. Just by clicking on that, it just shortened the X range – our

168
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,810
X values down here. If I want to get rid of that, I just hit the “X zoom info / Y zoom

169
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:59,088
enable” right here. And boom I hit that, and it takes me all the way out to the full

170
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,819
range of the unit. And again, I can just drag and drop that if I want to look at that a

171
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:11,549
little bit closer and get that smaller wavelength range. So our next step is we want to see

172
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:17,870
what this looks like in terms of a unit of measurement. In particular, µmol m⁻² s⁻¹.

173
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,610
So let’s come up here to “View.” Let’s go to “Radiometer” mode. And we want “MicroMoles

174
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,240
per square meter per second.” So I click on that, and again it’s going to give me

175
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,269
this warning message. It’s like this isn’t what you were calibrated to. And I say I understand.

176
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,528
I’m not under my calibration lights. I’m under the lights I changed it to. So I say

177
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:43,698
“Yes” and it is now going to give me the intensity of each wavelength. Now yours might

178
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:49,289
be much smaller than this. And the way we would change to see our graph on different

179
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:56,539
levels is we would go to that “View,” “Y scale,” “set Max Y.” I’m guessing

180
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:01,549
most of yours is something probably like this set at 10 instead of 1. And so that’s 10

181
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:08,359
µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ over here. So we want to go to “View,” “Y scale,” “set

182
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,529
Max Y” and let’s just go to 0.5 because it is [unintelligible] in here. And so then

183
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:21,859
it gives us a better scale. So then, at this point, let’s save it. Or actually, we’re

184
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:28,889
thinking to ourselves, you know maybe I’m curious about the intensity out here to 750

185
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,450
nm. Well if we wanted to change, the PAR range is set at 400 to 700 nm, but if I wanted to

186
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:40,230
see some of that far red and see the amount of µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ out here, I can go

187
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:48,298
to “View,” and I go to “Radiometer” and I “Setup Range for Watt and Rflux measurement.”

188
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,750
The first one’s 400. Well, we’ll leave that one that’s fine. Second one, let’s

189
00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:00,859
change that to 750. And now we’re going to see this value go up… 7.26. So we added

190
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:07,359
about a quarter more of µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ to go all the way out here to 750 nm. So,

191
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:14,819
we like what we’re looking at. Let’s go ahead and save this sample. So we go to “File,”

192
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,558
“Save,” “Sample.” And we’re just saving it to the desktop for our example right

193
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:29,359
here. So we will save it as “light sample.” And we want to save it as a .IRR file. So

194
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,490
we save that. And again, you can change this. It’s different than what your zoom mode

195
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,870
is. This is actually setting the export parameters. But for ours we’ll just set it at 350. I

196
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:46,250
like to do wavelength increment of 1. And then it did take it all the way out there

197
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,700
to the max of 1100… Now that we have those samples saved, let’s just show a quick tool

198
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,120
on how to look at these graphs in spreadsheets or in Excel so we can see how they graph out.

199
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,439
What we’ll go ahead and do is we’ll just open up a blank Excel here – you can see

200
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,100
I have a blank Excel opened here. And we’re just going to drag, let’s look at the light

201
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:11,969
sample spectrum. So we’re just going to drag this over and drop it right there. It

202
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,558
opens up in a new window, but that’s fine. We’re just doing a quick analysis here.

203
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,379
So we’re going to click on “DATA” because we need to get this to text to columns. But

204
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,669
first, we need to highlight it. So we highlight column A. “Text to Columns.” “Delimited”

205
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:33,030
– that’s correct we can already see down here our data. Our nanometer wavelength here

206
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:38,359
and then our intensity in terms of µmol m⁻² s⁻¹. So we hit “Next.” Yes, we want

207
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:45,519
those in separate columns. We hit “Finish.” And then for fun let’s rename this nm here,

208
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:52,639
and let’s rename this µmol. Then I’m going to hit (Ctrl + ↓); it takes me to

209
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,559
the bottom. Then I’m going to hit (Shift + →). (Ctrl + Shift + ↑). You see it comes

210
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:01,990
with this nice little “Quick Analysis” tool. I will click on that. I’m going to

211
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,500
click on “CHARTS.” And then I’m going to do “Line.” And there we go. We just

212
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,950
have a very quick analysis, but we can see we can now analyze it using Excel. So with

213
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,890
that, that concludes our video today. I hope you learned something. Let me know if you
