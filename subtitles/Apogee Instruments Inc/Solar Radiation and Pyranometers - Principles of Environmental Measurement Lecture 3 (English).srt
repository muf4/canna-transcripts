1
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:26,518
One of the other very key measurements is solar radiation, to any

2
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:36,269
input. For decades the only instruments available were expensive

3
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:44,969
blackbody pyranometers, then silicon-cell pyranometers became available and I

4
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,289
think we have some here. They are in the catalogs. Let's see if we got one

5
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:59,370
sitting here. Well this is close. This  is actually a quantum sensor but

6
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:08,310
but they're this size, they're tiny. Now siliconcell pyranometers are almost an

7
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,109
order of magnitude cheaper than black-body pyranometers, so all of us use

8
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,938
silicon-cell pyranometers on weather stations to get solar radiation, for our

9
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,758
Penman-Monteith models and everything else. We just say great we've just

10
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,079
saved a lot of money, but what I want to show you is the differences and the

11
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:39,169
errors that you get with silicon-cell pyranometers. These are not

12
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,000
widely appreciated. It's only our work comparing them rigorously back and forth

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,978
that we've seen these things. This comes from the fact that

14
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,789
black-body pyranometers, and you look at them and there's a glass dome and a

15
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:05,440
black disk, record all of the wavelength, all of the radiation over this whole

16
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:15,159
solar spectrum. This is the entire solar spectrum and on a typical sunny day. They

17
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,900
measure all of this these are all giant bands of absorption of water vapor and

18
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:27,400
the spectrum. Outside the atmosphere it's a smooth curve, but silicon-cells

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:35,560
pyranometers subsample this spectra and predict the rest. We do that all the

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,519
time in science we subsample things and then we predict the whole and

21
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:48,120
that's fine, but subsampling changes the perspective changes with atmospheric

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,400
humidity. What I'll show you is the data on how does atmospheric humidity

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,189
effect this spectra and how does it affect the accuracy of our silicon-cell

24
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:14,769
pyranometers. I don't know how many of these I need, but this curve

25
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,150
will relate to the next talk and photosynthetic radiation. There's so many

26
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,810
things you can see from this curve and we made a refrigerator magnet, nowadays

27
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,099
not everybody put these on refrigerators but I'm pleased I go around and people have

28
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,000
these on their filing cabinets so they can see the curve but here's a magnet.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,870
You could pass around and take one, and don't put it but a disk it might

30
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,590
de-magnetize it or it might change it. This is just a curve showing this in

31
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,280
a couple different units. Here's watts per meter squared, but what happens on

32
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,709
cloudy days? Here's the whole spectrum as an introduction to radiation

33
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,359
measurements and radiation was what Apogee has cut its teeth on, our quantum

34
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:05,710
sensors and we're known as a radiation sensor company.

35
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:13,030
That's the whole curve. Now we get photosynthetically active, which is most

36
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,480
people in this room we've got 400 and 700 nm memorized, that's the range of

37
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,170
wavelengths that cause photosynthesis. It's also really close to the range of

38
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:30,640
wavelengths for human vision then finally down here UV. There's times and

39
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,110
we just want to measure this, but with pyranometers were measuring the whole

40
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,490
thing. It's all thermal radiation, that's what drives the change of state of water

41
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,810
from liquid to gas. Here's black-body and silicon-cells. Now look at how this

42
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,259
curve changes on a cloudy day, atmospheric water vapor not only takes

43
00:04:53,259 --> 00:05:00,730
out these bands but it greatly reduces these bands of radiation. If you measure

44
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,550
the whole thing with the black-body pyranometer, you accurately measure this but

45
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:13,329
if you're only subsampling it, just look at this spectra is hardly changed

46
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:18,639
in the short wavelengths on a cloudy day it selectively shifts the wavelengths

47
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:27,250
this direction and this is the spectral response of a silicon-cell, these smaller

48
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:38,230
silicon cell parameters that we all use. It selectively measures this;

49
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,830
it doesn't measure this. What happens is they over measure on cloudy days

50
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:49,120
because they're sub sampling the part that's transmitted more. How bad is

51
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,040
this effect of oversampling? Almost ten percent, depending on how much cloudy sky

52
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,010
there is but that's a big error on cloudy days. Let's take a look at a

53
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:10,360
couple of cloudy days in here. Here happens to be three days when we had

54
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,780
full Sun, which is what these sensors are calibrated to and then partly cloudy and

55
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,409
then significantly cloudy here. If you

56
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,570
just look at this, it looks like the curves are really pretty close the black-body

57
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:32,379
and silicon-cell but when you calculate the errors almost none here

58
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:38,050
and that just gets bigger here. Here's where we're nine, ten, even eleven times

59
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,180
it's greater than a ten percent error.

60
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,870
You can of course correct for this if you know the effect and you know

61
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,509
the fraction of clouds, but rarely do people do this they just assume the

62
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:58,418
silicon-cell is correct at all times. There's a  humidity

63
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:05,740
effect on this on this measurement;  here's the magnitude of the

64
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,370
effect here. Again they're accurate in full sun because they're calibrated to

65
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:21,579
full sun. This is the same thing, data ratio of clear sky to actual and error

66
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,750
always goes high in these conditions. This is also probably a pretty good

67
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:31,629
example of models. This is an average of these but this should

68
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,829
taper down to zero and there's just a few data points and if you fit this with the

69
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:40,300
model that red line is really not very representative up here because we don't

70
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,120
have enough data to make that. But, it's an example of how we take data and make

71
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,490
a model out of it, but on severely cloudy days or significantly cloudy days it's

72
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:58,680
a pretty big error from silicon-cell pyranometers. The good news about this is

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,530
the cost of black-body pyranometers continues to come down and because of

74
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:10,089
these errors, we've sold a silicon-cell pyranometer for a long, long time and

75
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,098
we just help people about these errors, but because of this and because of the

76
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:20,379
need to make accurate solar radiation measurements on all the days, Apogee has

77
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:28,629
now developed a black-body pyranometer that looks like this and it doesn't

78
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,219
have these kinds of errors because of the spectra that it measures.

79
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:43,300
The second source of error among instruments is called cosine error, and

80
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,399
that refers to how accurately does the sensor measure all the angles of

81
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,649
radiation. You can put any light sensor out there and get some relative

82
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:58,839
indication of light but it is really difficult to calibrate it for light

83
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,670
coming right straight down and have it also be accurate when the light comes in

84
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:10,208
at a low angle. Or same thing on a cloudy day, where there's equal radiation from

85
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:16,000
all angles, the sensor has to accurately integrate all those angles. Here's an

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,448
example of low angle radiation

87
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:28,120
coming into this, and that's why we call this cosine correction because if it's

88
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,429
coming at this angle the sensor should read 500. It's not supposed to read a

89
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:39,338
thousand, that's cosine correction. Does it really read 500 if it's at that

90
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:44,439
angle? You have to get that correction with the optics of the sensor

91
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:50,818
and all radiation manufacturers work hard to get cosine correction, at least

92
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:55,719
the ones selling what we call research grade instruments. There's plenty of

93
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,790
pyranometers out there that are really cheap and boy they do a terrible job of

94
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:09,309
this. I worry about people selling cheap instruments and

95
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:14,109
getting the cosine really wrong and  if you know what you're doing you

96
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,490
can test this compared to a better instrument, but this cosine is one of the

97
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,860
things that some lower-cost manufacturers sometimes

98
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,438
forget. Here's all the angles coming into this thing. This is a graph of the

99
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:36,639
angle and error. In this case, this is a bunch of parameters and the standard

100
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,870
deviations. The morning and evening are slightly different. They're really

101
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,060
close until we get out to 75 degrees then the errors get bigger. This means

102
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,609
they're not as accurate at dawn and dusk for those measurements, but there's not

103
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,860
very much radiation out here either. It's low light, so a five percent error in low

104
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,190
light is not that big of an error in absolute terms. But you would like these

105
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,520
instruments, to be accurate all day long, and summer and winter. How about changing

106
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,829
Sun angles. We get summer angles in here and then we get winter angles over here.

107
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,900
If it's not cosine corrected, it can have a big seasonal error because they're

108
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:32,778
typically calibrated for summer sunlight angles. We specify these often by the

109
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:41,200
error out here at 75 degrees and this is an example of how companies right

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,060
specifications to how accurate are they out there. You can't just test one sensor

111
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:52,009
you got to take your entire pool of sensors with replicates and you want to

112
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:57,588
make sure your specification matches all your instruments not just your best

113
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:07,339
sensor. We specify 5% at 75 degrees and this is two times the standard

114
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:16,270
deviation, which is ninety-six percent of the tested sensors. Stability, this is

115
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:22,458
characteristic of all instruments, how stable are they long term. Humidity

116
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:27,619
companies have said everybody can build a humidity sensor and it's accurate on

117
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,679
day one now check it two years later three years later. All sensors drift

118
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:42,620
but companies work hard to minimize that drift. This is some test of silicon-cell

119
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,889
pyranometers for long-term drift compared to high-end black-body. Now, Kip and Zonen

120
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:53,449
sells very expensive high-end black-bodies. This is on the roof of our

121
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,830
building in Logan Utah. Multiple replicate  high-end instruments to get a very

122
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:07,150
accurate reference point. You can see there's two glass domes inside of these

123
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:17,379
to make a primary standard instrument. Here's data, now we don't show the

124
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,750
hundred pyrometers next to these but it's a big table that's checking them and

125
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:30,159
this is some data that were compared. the mean change was only point one percent

126
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,769
per year. On average these are very stable. I mean it's a very hard number to even

127
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,470
measure, point you have to go ten years before you even see a one-percent drift.

128
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:47,200
But there's some variability in these, so we had some that drifted as much as one

129
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,150
point eight percent. Now oddly enough, some went up too. They don't always drift

130
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:57,519
down. There's tiny changes in the optics that affect the stability of the

131
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,720
instruments. Because of this we write our specification at two percent a year drift.

132
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,370
That's all of the sensors should drift less than that even though the mean

133
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,970
is less than a tenth of a percent a year. Again I talked about this

134
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,720
accelerated aging before but to really be sure you've got quality

135
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,759
instruments you need to check long-term stability. It's one of the troubles with

136
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,659
new instruments. Everybody gets excited with new instruments. How much did the

137
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:37,449
manufacturer test those for long-term stability? You can't put them in an

138
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,629
environment for ten years you're depriving people of that new technology

139
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:46,570
but you can run accelerated aging tests to try and make them fail to get better

140
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:52,420
confidence that they're going to work in a range of environmentsm the tropics and

141
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:59,469
the cold places, warm places. That's a critical thing with research grade

142
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:06,080
instruments. Another little point on these, here's some frost.

143
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,620
Here we are in Sydney you don't get frost here right but but you get dew, you

144
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,340
get condensation here. Here was a morning, where we had cold warning, we had

145
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,360
frost and actually this might be a radiation frost, which we'll talk about

146
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,379
in a little bit, but these two sensors right here are clear. They're clear

147
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:36,789
because they're heated and with this little sensor we can put a tiny little

148
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:42,589
resistance heater in this and warm it up just slightly to keep condensation off

149
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:49,460
the sensor and to keep dew off the sensor, which we call that occlusion of the

150
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,800
optical path. If there's anything on that sensor, it's going to read incorrectly

151
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:01,189
and frost is huge. I got some pictures in here of snow on sensors. That's also

152
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:07,340
huge. It blocks, it sits on the sensor. You can buy heaters for those

153
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,639
primary standard pyranometers but now we're talking five to ten thousand

154
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,629
dollars for one instrument that's heated and ventilated to make an

155
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,700
accurate measurement versus a few hundred dollars for a tiny sensor that

156
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,600
has a heater in it. Those heaters have helped quite a bit to help people make

157
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,029
more accurate measurements in places that get condensation or in places that

158
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:42,100
get snow and frost. Here's an example of snow, buried under snow here and and

159
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,600
above the snow here. The sensor is also on a pedestal to keep it above so snow can't

160
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,889
stick to it.

161
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,080
Temperature affects radiation sensors. This is an example of comparative tests

162
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,810
that we've done with Li-Cor silicon-cell pyranometers and ours. There's a tiny

163
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:11,129
temperature effect in here. Most research grade sensors, this is a small effect

164
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,650
look at this goes from minus ten to plus 40 and the effect is only one percent.

165
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,730
Again for precision measurements, this is repeatable so you can measure

166
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,509
and correct for the temperature effect on the sensor. That depends on how

167
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:32,089
accurate you need the solar radiation.

168
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:43,019
This I think might be my last slide in this and I think we can talk

169
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:51,170
about net radiation next. Okay this relates to that.

170
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:57,420
Remember how we subsampled the solar radiation? We often want to know, turn

171
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,960
them upside down, and know reflected radiation from the ground. That's net

172
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,470
shortwave radiation. We take a carefully calibrated silicon-cell sensor

173
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,420
and it's turn it upside down and we say great now we know incoming and we'll

174
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:22,620
subtract outgoing, and we have net shortwave radiation. That would be wrong

175
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:28,259
because this sub-samples you turn it upside down and the reflected radiation

176
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:34,589
is different. You can get significant errors if you turn this upside down to

177
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:39,659
do reflected radiation and here's the magnitude of the errors fourteen percent

178
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,470
error over a grass canopy. You can see almost twenty percent errors. You

179
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,380
should never use a silicon-cell pyranometer upside down to get reflected

180
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,070
radiation. They are not calibrated for that. You have to go to a black-body

181
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:02,109
pyranometer, which doesn't have this source of

182
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:07,329
radiation. These are so inexpensive

183
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:14,029
everybody gets tempted to do this and  if you know this and you're

184
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:20,779
confident you could correct for it in software, butyou get really nervous

185
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:27,289
about all these fudge factors. Sometimes they can make measurements

186
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:37,750
worse. Question: "What about if you use it in the vertical position, not horizontal,

187
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,940
90 degrees?"

188
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:03,170
Okay, yes there is same thing because now you're not

189
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:09,700
measuring the sky it's reflected. These errors would be similar to this

190
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:17,180
because we're subsampling and the spectral changes.

191
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:24,320
Same thing as cloudes.  Yeah, we spent some time in this because lots of people

192
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:30,700
use these this way and you tell them not to and they still do and

193
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,930
people don't read the owners manual. They just think I like this sensor and I'm going to

194
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:45,140
use it. Tdone a bunch of work on

195
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,130
to characterize these errors and try and make people aware of them through workshops

196
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:56,150
like this, through videos online. If you know what you're doing as a research

197
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,710
scientist, you can often get away with a lower cost sensor because you know its

198
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,960
limitations. Pretty often it's people that don't know what they're doing that

199
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,460
get tempted to buy low cost sensors and then they misuse them and they can have

200
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:18,710
big errors. It's sad because you see it all too often. Part of what we

201
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,850
want to help you do is evaluate specifications of instruments you don't

202
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:28,339
need to over by expensive instruments but if you understand the specs

203
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:33,369
sometimes you can get away with less expensive. Often you can get away with less than

204
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:38,689
the highest cost instruments if you really know what you're doing and  the

205
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,190
limitations of the sensors.

206
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:48,829
Leveling is a big source of error. Sensors become

207
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:52,819
unlevel or people don't check that often enough. What if the sensor

208
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:58,339
starts to tilt very slightly to the Sun or away from the Sun you can quickly get

209
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:03,259
big errors from leveling. We spend a lot of time making really rigorous

210
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:07,460
leveling mounts and they all have a bubble-level, but now you got to climb in

211
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,059
your tower and look at that bubble-level to see that it's staying level.

212
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:20,179
Occlusion of the sensor, of the dome is a problem. Some sensors that are flat trap

213
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,310
debris. They trap water, the trap dew. That's an error, and of course you can

214
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:29,720
clean the sensors but how many of us do. We don't and now they read

215
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,460
ten percent low maybe until you get a a rain

216
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:40,490
storm and it flushes the sensor clean. Sensors that have a dome top help, a

217
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,769
lot. The water, their self-cleaning and the water tends to run off. Those

218
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:53,029
dome tops help keep the sensor clean, also helps keep it dry. That's

219
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:57,829
another nemesis of all instrument manufacturers is moisture getting in

220
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:06,289
their sensors causing drift or even the sensor to fail.

221
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:11,379
Let me go back to this.

222
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:20,579
If you look at high-end sensors and now

223
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,480
unfortunately we can't quite see them in this picture because these all have a

224
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,170
shield and aspirated to get peak accuracy but you see a little side port

225
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:37,620
with desiccant in the port. It often changes color, it is designed to change color.

226
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:43,379
If water vapor gets inside the sensor, you change that. We go to a

227
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,780
conference in Brussels each year, a

228
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:54,720
World Meteorological conference;  Kipp and Zonnen doesn't have that little disk with

229
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,940
dessicant on their sensors, and doesn't that keep your sensor dry

230
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,430
internally, keep this perfectly dry so you never had condensation. They said

231
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,509
the biggest source of leaks in our sensor was that port, that little

232
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:14,940
desiccant port. So we just took it out and now we have a better sea;omg and

233
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,900
it's dry when it's manufactured and we hopeit's going to stay dry for many

234
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,400
years. It's an interesting change in the development of sensors. They felt

235
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,769
like taking that out helped people make better measurements than leaving it in

236
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:34,039
and making them go and change the desiccant in the sensor.

237
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,509
We pot our sensors solid so there's no, in the pyranometers,

238
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:45,150
there's not air space. Moisture can't get in and cause problems with the measurement.

239
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,340
Question:

240
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,500
A couple things. The fundamental physics

241
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,660
of the detector change. Solar panels degrade over time and this is basically

242
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:11,710
a solar panel on a silicon cell that that's becoming less efficient at taking

243
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,500
sunlight and making the voltage. Changes in the optical path, tiny changes in

244
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:24,509
deterioration of the diffusing material over it that can become less transparent.

245
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:29,069
Those are the both of the biggest fundamental things. In black-body

246
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:34,599
pyranometers it's changes in this black surface. Nark just talked about

247
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:40,269
emissivity, boy they work hard to make that emissivity as close to 1.00 as

248
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:47,589
possible but as that ages it starts to turn gray. If it gets from 1.00 to

249
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:54,839
0.99 well there's a one percent error. It's not fully absorbing the

250
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,548
radiation. Really all sensors have that, just the fundamental physics

251
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:07,569
of aging of the object detector and solar radiation sensors are particularly

252
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:14,220
subject to drift, aging caused drift.

253
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:31,359
Question: "What happens with artifical light? Do you get any over samples?"

254
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:38,529
You bet you do. These are calibrated for sunlight based on that frist slide so now if you

255
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:42,789
wanted and lots of people do this. They put them under electric lights, which

256
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:48,279
have a very different spectra than sunlight so silicon pyranometers can be

257
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:54,099
way off with maybe fifty percent errors under electric lights because of the

258
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:57,359
change in the spectra.

259
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:04,619
Question: "What about ones specifically calibrated for the lights?" Yes, exactly it's possible to calibrate them and they're fine.

260
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:09,209
As long as you don't have a mix of sunlight and electric, but yes they

261
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,490
just need to be calibrated against a black-body pyrometer for that light

262
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,630
source and then they're fine because you know the spectra and you can sub sample

263
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:26,810
and predict all of it. I'm going to say one other thing that not on the list but

264
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:35,429
I'll use this sensor is an example. The cable leading to sensors, different

265
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:41,160
companies use different cables. You've got to get the signal from the sensor to

266
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:49,170
the datalogger and higher quality sensors have higher quality cables

267
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:54,210
coming out of them. So usually people write specifications for the

268
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,289
cable and the first dead obvious one is you want this thing to be as waterproof

269
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:03,450
as possible. Moisture starts to get in this, the signal even though this is

270
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:09,960
perfect it's not getting accurately to the datalogger. The other specification

271
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:17,579
that's good to look for in sensors is shielding for electromagnetic radiation

272
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:22,139
and that's just wrapped with tin foil and grounded at the other end so that

273
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,980
you don't get electrical interference and inside in greenhouses this can be a

274
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,779
particular problem. If they're near fluorescent lights, if they're near equipment,

275
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,950
you get electromagnetic noise picked up by the cable so we shield them.

276
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:42,200
That further minimizes any antenna effect of the sensor and so the

277
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,019
signal gets cleanly and clearly back to the detector so it's shielded twisted

278
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:54,409
pair cable is the highest quality cable so you can get the signal back

279
00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:04,970
to the detector. Not in the recent past we used analog sensors they took an

280
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,200
environmental change they make a voltage you measure the voltage at the data

281
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,960
logger and you convert it to our units that we want. Wensors are rapidly

282
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,740
changing to digital sensors with micro processors in the sensors. The

283
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,960
measurement is made right in the head of the sensor and a digital signal is sent

284
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:35,750
back to the datalogger. All companies are moving to more digital sensors it

285
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,648
changes the nature of the datalogger that you measure it with, changes this

286
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:46,788
whole thing because of the digital signal. That's generally a good thing and

287
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:52,190
the cost of that technology is coming down with digital sensors. The three big

288
00:29:52,190 --> 00:30:00,669
signals are SDI-12 (serial digital interface 12) is common in sensors,

289
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:11,690
Modbus is a second common one and now USB. This one happens to be a USB port. No

290
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,528
datalogger needed. You buy the sensors and plug it into your laptop then you

291
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:21,490
use the software and control the results on the screen.

292
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:28,579
The interface is changing fast in sensors and the nature of the

293
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:33,980
meter that you use to the sensor is changing because of that. It used to be

294
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,880
digital sensors were quite a bit more expensive but now that's much less true.

295
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:45,080
In general digital sensors are better because of this signal effect,

296
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,699
it's easier to send a digital signal

297
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,500
over, not easier it's more accurate to send a digital signal over a wire than

298
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,619
an analog signal, and puts the puts the burden of measurement right in the

299
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:04,288
sensor head. I don't know if you can have seen these options in sensors.

300
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:08,730
It's really just in the last few years that more digital sensors have become

301
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,740
available. They're the same sensor, same optics it's just a little microprocessor

302
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,259
in the head.
