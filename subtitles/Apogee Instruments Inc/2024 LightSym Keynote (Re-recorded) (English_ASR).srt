1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,080
I'm Bruce bugby president of apogee

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,120
instruments and I'm here today to record

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,039
The Talk The keynote talk that I gave a

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,879
few weeks ago at the light Sim symposia

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,879
in Soul

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,320
Korea this was the very opening Talk of

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,359
the conference and it was a great honor

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,480
to uh be asked to do this um what I

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,720
chose to talk about is not the details

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,719
of our photobiology research that my

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,359
students have I've done especially over

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,520
the last 10 years but as the opening

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:42,159
talk to the to the symposia of research

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,000
scientist I wanted to talk about more

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,919
about the process of Science and how we

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
use our instruments and tools to create

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,559
new knowledge um so these next few

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,039
slides are are what I showed there my

19
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,000
opening slide was

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:05,359
this this is a picture drawn by an

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,959
artist here in Utah James Christensen of

22
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,519
a home tinkerer taking his new spaceship

23
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,319
out for a drive in the space and I've

24
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,478
just loved this picture it's framed in

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,679
my laboratory but he's got all these

26
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,359
gizmos that he rigged up this is far

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,360
from high-tech in fact I think the title

28
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,759
of this was low Tech um but this is what

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,879
we all do in our Research Laboratories

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,400
Tinker with things build gizmos test

31
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,319
hypotheses they're much different than a

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,240
commercial Enterprise that might all be

33
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:39,118
built out of stainless steel and and

34
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,798
something something fancy there's the

35
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,599
name of the Symposium light Sim 2024

36
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,240
this through several hundred research

37
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,519
scientists really from all over the

38
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:51,438
world so it was truly a great honor for

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:55,280
me to uh give the opening talk of this

40
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:58,879
and as part of that it's light and and

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:03,039
photosynthesis and photons so I want to

42
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:05,718
start with a view of where we have come

43
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,800
with creating light for ourselves over

44
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:12,439
the past 150 years this comes from a

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,040
paper in the journal Nature which I

46
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:18,318
published with some colleagues LEDs for

47
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,759
photons physiology and food and in this

48
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:25,000
review paper we talked about the history

49
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:27,959
of light we started with kerosene lamps

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,318
what was the energy and the kerosene and

51
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,199
how much light did we out now this is

52
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:38,479
light measured in lumens per watt of

53
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:41,119
power going into this point4 now you can

54
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,719
see the tremendous breakthrough when we

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,640
got incandescent bulbs went from 04 to

56
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,639
15 it was an incredible advance and in

57
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,839
fact that was a 40-fold increase of

58
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:57,359
turning energy into light now this is

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,439
all for people but plant research as

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,720
I'll show in a minute has followed this

61
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:07,799
then in about just after World War II in

62
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:10,439
about 1950 we got fluorescent lights and

63
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,840
that was another big advance from 15 to

64
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,799
80 but that was a fivefold increase but

65
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,239
it was huge advance for everybody to

66
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,319
more light less heat um then in the

67
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,200
1970s we got high intensity discharge

68
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:30,438
lighting there's a high-press sodium

69
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:31,919
bulb 80 to 1 20 another huge Advance now

70
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,959
we're only talking

71
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:38,438
1.5x but each of these allowed us to do

72
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,239
more plant research with mostly with

73
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:44,039
higher intensities of light we weren't

74
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,239
doing so much back here with ratios of

75
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:49,598
colors as just getting the intensity up

76
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,239
but we still used a lot of colored

77
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:55,479
filters to create different ratios of

78
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,120
colors and some of my early papers right

79
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:01,598
in here were using hid and metal halight

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,920
lamps to uh with filters to get

81
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,959
different colors of light and then

82
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:10,238
Kaboom we get LEDs um roughly depend

83
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:14,400
when you say we started 10 or 20 years

84
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,600
ago and now another huge breakthrough in

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,918
terms of ratios of heat and light this

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,919
is for human lighting lumens per watt

87
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:27,279
but if we do this in micro moles of

88
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:30,959
photons per Jewel of energy and this is

89
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,599
the ratio for energy and photons out

90
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,038
here's the comparative numbers and look

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,400
at this

92
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:42,399
005 to 4 this is almost a 1,000 fold

93
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,399
increase in in U light and even even

94
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,439
here even if we start with incandescence

95
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,478
a tremendous breakthrough so now we get

96
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,120
all the colors we get very efficient in

97
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:55,360
uh lights so we can have high

98
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,319
intensity this is this is why we're all

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,120
assembled here for light Sim to talk

100
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:03,439
about our exciting work that we can now

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,439
do with

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,720
LEDs this ratio let me go back one this

103
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:14,519
is really light to heat lumens is light

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:18,880
watts is heat micro moles of photons is

105
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:22,799
Photon flux density and jewels is energy

106
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:27,439
so this is the ratio of these

107
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,918
two so what is sunlight it turns out

108
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,439
sunlight has two micromoles of

109
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:36,758
photosynthetic photons per Jewel of

110
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,959
thermal energy we don't think about that

111
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,720
ratio much but it I'll show you it's not

112
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,120
difficult to calculate for

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,720
sunlight now we have LEDs that are three

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,120
and they even exceed three micro moles

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,639
per Jewel just on this basis you can if

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,199
it's staggering because look we've

117
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,439
caught up and past sunlight with our

118
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,520
human technology it's just an in

119
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,360
incredible that we've done that and some

120
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,879
people have said yes so now we don't

121
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,000
need sunlight anymore we electric lights

122
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,000
are even better than sunlight but look

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,199
at this this Jewel of energy right here

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,720
oh let me get that back right here and

125
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,240
get my pen turned

126
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,960
on this Jewel of energy right here is

127
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
electricity we have to pay for that

128
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,959
Jewel of

129
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,478
energy this jewel is free from the

130
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:36,638
sunlight it comes with the Sun so we get

131
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,439
two micromoles for free and we pay for

132
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,079
these three so it's sunlight is still a

133
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:45,079
is still a tremendous uh source of light

134
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,120
because it's free compared to electric

135
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,918
lights but it's still 3 to two where do

136
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,399
we get two this is a Spectra of

137
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:57,000
wavelength of sunlight and intensity

138
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,839
here it's a classic ape has refrigerator

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,120
magnets with this Spectra on it this

140
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,478
part right here we say visible is really

141
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,199
photosynthetic Photon flux and this red

142
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,519
part out here is thermal doesn't drive

143
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,560
photosynthesis drives evaporation of

144
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,120
water it drives transpiration but it

145
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,519
doesn't drive photosynthesis so if you

146
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:24,360
look at this this is two and three based

147
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:28,359
on this ratio of this now if we include

148
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,280
far red photons in this that's this zone

149
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,919
right here for 400 to 700 nanm this

150
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,519
shifts this over slightly so now a

151
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:40,318
greater fraction of sunlight is photos

152
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,560
synthetic radiation and I'll come back

153
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,199
to this in this talk a bit but as as

154
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,759
most of you know this is a huge part of

155
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,919
uh the research of my students and I of

156
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,158
the value of these far red photons if we

157
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:56,000
include this this number gets slightly

158
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,519
bigger 2.3 micro moles per Jewel for

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
sunlight but we're still not trying to

160
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,120
catch up to electric lights we're still

161
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,598
trying to get favorable ratios of heat

162
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:11,439
of light to heat and if we do that well

163
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:14,360
we can air condition green houses now

164
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,079
that seems cost prohibitive now but let

165
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,000
me show you the Innovations in glass

166
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,878
that allows us to do

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,319
that this is once again here is our let

168
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,759
me get this in Black right here this is

169
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,759
our ppfd

170
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,879
same as visible light right here draw a

171
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
line right there this is the good part

172
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:42,120
we want a lot of this this is standard

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,519
glass that we've had for 100 years if we

174
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,519
put a coating on this it slightly

175
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,039
decreases visible but it dramatically

176
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,480
decreases the Heat and if we put more

177
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:57,240
coating even more and even more so all

178
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,560
of a sudden we have almost pure light

179
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,320
and very little thermal unusable thermal

180
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:07,759
out here when you use a low solar gain

181
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,959
glass we can air condition green houses

182
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,159
it's important to quantify this that's

183
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:16,759
why apog sells a flotilla of sensors to

184
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:19,719
rigorously quantify these ratios um but

185
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:22,879
this is a cutting edge of photobiology

186
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,600
and food production in highly controlled

187
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,120
environments is to use the right kinds

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,879
of solar glazing so we can close a

189
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,120
greenhouse not not only reduce the air

190
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,120
conditioning cost but allow us to seal

191
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,759
it and Elevate CO2 take advantage of

192
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:44,600
high CO2 that comes from Innovations and

193
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,720
glazing now let's go back to the history

194
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,079
of

195
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,600
photobiology to the

196
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:54,439
1950s this is when we were working with

197
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,560
fluorescent tubes and at Caltech

198
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,760
University in California Fritz went did

199
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:03,359
his pioneering work and he's a famous

200
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,159
famous scientist credited with the

201
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,039
discovery of oxen here's this here's his

202
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,000
work work from a plant physiology

203
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:14,319
textbook on oxen of the hormone oxen and

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,799
he wrote this book the experimental

205
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,560
control of plant growth It's a Wonderful

206
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,319
book about all these discoveries of

207
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,039
photo period and temperature

208
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,920
interactions and this is in this famous

209
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,879
calra phytotron where they could wheel

210
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,278
carts from different temperatures of

211
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,200
rooms and different lights of of rooms

212
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:36,480
all done with fluorescent

213
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,839
lights some of his famous quotes he's

214
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,440
are he he urg everybody to work in

215
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,639
controlled environments do more basic

216
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,480
research understand things at a very

217
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:49,879
fundamental level and now we have way

218
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,759
better tools than he ever had to do this

219
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,519
he advocated for very simple experiments

220
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,639
don't complex

221
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,720
experiments and he was very suspicious

222
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,600
of studies that needed a lot lot of

223
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,920
Statistics where he had a lot of

224
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,278
treatments and a lot of Statistics he

225
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:10,719
wanted fundamental data with more clear

226
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:14,879
results that's continues to be very wise

227
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,959
advice for all of us 50 years later to

228
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,600
do simple experiments with clear results

229
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:24,759
where we associate mechanisms with

230
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:29,399
experimental results I want to build on

231
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:31,679
this concept now in my next few slides

232
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:35,600
another famous scientist Ernest

233
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:39,159
Rutherford Nobel Prize in chemistry

234
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,759
1908 here's Ernest Rutherford was his

235
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:44,559
primitive tools of the time working out

236
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,480
breakthroughs in chemistry what did he

237
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,719
have to say about

238
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,800
statistics huh if your experiment needs

239
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,000
statistics y'all have done a better

240
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,278
experiment that's still wise advice do

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,440
simple experiments with clear results

242
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:03,480
not complex experiments that need a ton

243
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,079
of Statistics to interpret them not that

244
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,039
statistics is a bad thing we all use it

245
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:12,359
it's critical but we shouldn't rely on

246
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,399
the crutch of Statistics to design our

247
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,959
experiments they should be clear

248
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,799
fundamental test of

249
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,439
hypotheses sometimes we design

250
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,519
experiments that are more like a fishing

251
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,360
trip than a re real research we just

252
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,720
going to do a lot of stuff and see what

253
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,959
happens um good luck getting your

254
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,680
proposals funded if the reviewers think

255
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:35,679
they might be a fishing

256
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:38,198
trip Serendipity plays a huge role in

257
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,919
science we have we still go for what

258
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:43,719
we're looking for but people the public

259
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,919
thinks the most exciting phrase in all

260
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,639
of science is ah Eureka I just

261
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,639
discovered it Ah that's not how it works

262
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,278
the most exciting phrase is that's funny

263
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,159
there's an outlier here who said that

264
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:59,559
Isaac Asimov famous science fiction

265
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:02,480
writer and that's highlighted in this

266
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:05,000
book serendipitous discoveries and plant

267
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,000
science you can never plan for

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,720
Serendipity you have to be doing good

269
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,399
science but you have to have a trained

270
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,399
mind to understand when there's good

271
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,559
data and when there's bad data and we

272
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:23,480
all need to train our minds to to be

273
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:27,719
looking for these unusual data when they

274
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:31,120
arise another famous scientist leis

275
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Pastor 18

276
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,600
1800s Chance favors the prepared mind

277
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,959
this is one of his most famous quotes I

278
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,240
have just loved this my whole career

279
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,159
studying in graduate school to get my

280
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,360
prepared mind for that that chance

281
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:51,399
moment what that really means is when

282
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,959
you have data like this and now you say

283
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:58,440
eh here's my curve for the

284
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:01,119
response let's get this in yellow here's

285
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,000
my curve for the response I don't like

286
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,519
that data point that's an outlier I'm

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,320
just going to take it

288
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,159
out how do you know that's an outlier

289
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,480
just because you can draw a nice smooth

290
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,159
curve for the rest of the data we should

291
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,920
be looking at outliers and understanding

292
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,039
what caused them that's why this quote

293
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,198
is so famous and by the way when you

294
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,559
read his original stuff one two three

295
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,319
four five words how elegant is that

296
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,638
that's not what he originally said says

297
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,480
in the fields of observation Chance

298
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,440
favors only the prepared mind so

299
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,480
subsequent editors said we can do better

300
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,040
than that take that out take that out we

301
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,120
got his five words but there was edited

302
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:46,919
from his original quote that speaks to

303
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:51,000
the value of editing in in our writing

304
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,799
too here's a famous thing everybody

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,480
believes a

306
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,159
measurement except the person who made

307
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,399
it now this is amazing thing to say is

308
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,838
an instrument company we're all about

309
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,839
making measurements but it's some of

310
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,800
those measurements are so hard to make

311
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,639
you got to be skeptical of your own data

312
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,039
even if other people believe it No One

313
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,320
Believes a

314
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,278
model except the person who made it so

315
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,480
people that make models say I've modeled

316
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,480
this I know all about it what this

317
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,480
really means is we should be more

318
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,480
skeptical of measurements and and do

319
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,199
more careful models but more than

320
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,920
anything it's the combination of

321
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:36,559
measurements and models that leads

322
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,439
to knowledge we need to go back and

323
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,958
forth between these and all of our

324
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,480
science too often we make too many

325
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,758
measurements without the pr underlying

326
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,639
principles without connecting them to

327
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,560
Theory and it leads to bad data and if

328
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,799
we do only models we lead to Crazy

329
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:57,638
models not connected to reality it's the

330
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,599
back and forth interaction that helps us

331
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,720
proceed in science

332
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,480
and I've used this analogy of a person

333
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,120
going to the top of a house on Two Step

334
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,039
ladders one step ladder is measurements

335
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,240
one is Theory or or models and you get

336
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,159
to the top faster if you take one step

337
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,759
on each ladder and you go back and forth

338
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,360
and you get right up to the top of the

339
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,480
house you could get there by making only

340
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,720
measurements but pretty hard to jump on

341
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:30,360
one step in a ladder or one step here

342
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,120
it's better to go back and forth so as a

343
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,959
sense of back and forth I made this

344
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,440
little diagram here's Theory and

345
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,879
knowledge far apart back and forth back

346
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,880
and forth we gain wisdom as we go but

347
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,078
what if we move those closer together

348
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,958
high frequency back and forth we make a

349
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:49,679
lot faster knowledge and then here we

350
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:54,318
are in

351
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:57,120
Korea if we can conclude Theory and

352
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,599
measurement in within the same person

353
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,720
that's really efficient for advancing

354
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,880
science so my point here is become

355
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,360
excellent in making measurements but

356
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,679
become equally measurement equally

357
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,279
excellent at learning the theory and the

358
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,600
underlying principles of

359
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:20,078
this now it's shift for a few slides on

360
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,958
photobiology this is from a paper by

361
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:27,318
brisen and vulgan many years ago they

362
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,840
did Optics of light this is a plant a

363
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:33,240
side view of a plant leaf

364
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,399
um this is a pretty famous picture

365
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,839
here's the top of the leaf let's see if

366
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,840
I can get this in here there we go

367
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,240
um and here's the bottom of the leaf

368
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,839
green light penetrates better than red

369
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,319
and blue we think these are so

370
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,879
photosynthetic efficient but they're

371
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,960
absorbed in that very top layer green

372
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,360
penetrates this green is

373
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,000
underappreciated value and not not just

374
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:04,199
as it penetrate a leaf but it penetrates

375
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,319
the whole canopy to the next Leaf below

376
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,919
this is the basis for a lot of our

377
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:12,119
findings just this simple concept of red

378
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:15,038
green and blue but now I would like to

379
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,678
add another wavelength to this we can't

380
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,158
really call it a

381
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:24,159
color I put far red in here now all of

382
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:26,520
our data is clear that far red has

383
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,240
photosynthetic value I'm going to show

384
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,558
you that we've shifted definition of

385
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,960
photosynthetic wavelengths for this but

386
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:38,000
fared is also very penetrating in plant

387
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,360
canopies and in leaves and sometimes we

388
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
only study single leaves we

389
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,279
underappreciate the value of these

390
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,400
colors in

391
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:49,720
canopies this concept of one two three

392
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,200
and adding a fourth category has really

393
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,440
helped Advance our science in this and

394
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,640
look at the profound impact lettuce more

395
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,159
than any other crop lettuce is really

396
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,440
responds to fared cell division cell

397
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,000
enlargement we had a little bit of far

398
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,360
red and we more than double growth of

399
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,720
the lettuce this is a combination of

400
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,000
photosynthetic photons and cell

401
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,440
expansion and cell division caused

402
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,919
associated with far red and we call this

403
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,640
the shade response but we cont trict the

404
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,799
plants to thinking they're in the shade

405
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,799
when they're in the sunlight it's just a

406
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:29,400
powerful image of the importance of far

407
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:32,079
red this had led

408
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,200
to a shift in how we Define

409
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:38,359
photosynthetic Photon flux density

410
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,120
here's 400 to 700 the conventional

411
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:44,678
definition that we've used for half a

412
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:47,959
century here's extended photosynthetic

413
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,759
Photon flux density with another 50

414
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,319
nanometers out here of photosynthetic

415
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,480
photons and it's this part right here

416
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:59,359
that resulted in that lettuce plant

417
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,000
enormous increase in growth

418
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,918
what we Advocate is report measure and

419
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,919
Report both of these in papers um we we

420
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:12,480
need to understand the the growth per

421
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:15,480
unit old definition but also for the new

422
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
definition

423
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,480
epfd but now we're learning when does

424
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,918
this apply and when does it not this is

425
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,880
Paul Kuma got his PhD with me he's at

426
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,679
veninga now um this is the paper that

427
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,039
resulted in this these were studies with

428
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,519
lettuce at three intensities a very low

429
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:42,079
intensity of 100 micromoles per meter

430
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:45,119
squ per second doubling to 200 and then

431
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:48,079
doubling again to 500 now this is an

432
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,759
excellent wavelength and you can see we

433
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,798
added far red percent far red we added

434
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,359
up to 30% and the leuce responded that's

435
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:58,200
where that picture came from in the

436
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:01,519
previous slide right here if we only

437
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,319
gave them lower light that line is flat

438
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:09,519
there was no benefit of far red if the

439
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:11,960
if the light intensity was low this is

440
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,240
with what we call substitution as we

441
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,079
added far red photons we took away

442
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,599
traditional photons so the efd was

443
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,879
exactly the same and if they were in

444
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,599
very low light it was actually

445
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,000
inhibitory um they needed those shorter

446
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:31,000
wavelength photons so what do we do when

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,599
we do this we normalize percent of

448
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,839
control and this is the data normalized

449
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:40,240
to one here and now the trend becomes

450
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:42,759
very clear far red was far more

451
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,359
beneficial with a higher total

452
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:49,278
background of photon flux than a lower

453
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:51,479
background um this is going to be

454
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:53,919
followed up by a lot of people I'm sure

455
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,519
but um it's a very fascinating

456
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,240
interaction of far red photons and total

457
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,000
amount of Light which again then we need

458
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,000
to measure

459
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,798
both spinach you would think responds

460
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,120
like lettuce but it's a different genus

461
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:12,440
it's a different

462
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:15,558
species all of our studies with spinach

463
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,159
have shown it's much much less sensitive

464
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:22,960
to far red photons this is a picture

465
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:25,278
here's far red percentage same as the

466
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,880
other one instead of data points it's a

467
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:32,119
picture this and 100 200 500 under the

468
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,840
same study far red

469
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,479
minimally increase growth growth

470
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:40,079
increases a lot with more intensity but

471
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,558
more far red minimal effects all of

472
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:46,599
these pictures are similar here so we

473
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,639
have a lot to learn about interactions

474
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:52,719
of far red with Photon flux these

475
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,600
studies were done by Noah langenfeld in

476
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,679
my laboratory we following up on these

477
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,038
interactions with other species

478
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,919
fascinating

479
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,798
photobiology now we have a very powerful

480
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,120
tool we we're we're going to hear

481
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,038
numerous talks in this conference about

482
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:14,918
all these principles applied to plants

483
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:18,359
um I'm excited to be here I'm excited to

484
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,060
uh hear all these talks and uh thanks

485
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:30,858
for listening
