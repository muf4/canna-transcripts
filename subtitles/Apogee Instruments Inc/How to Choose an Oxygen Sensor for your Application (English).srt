00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
Hello and welcome my name is Schuyler Smith,

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,870
and we're going to talk about

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,740
Oxygen Sensors from Apogee instruments today and

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,799
which one is right for you.

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,820
This is part of our frequently asked questions

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,160
from technical support here at Apogee Instruments.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,980
These are the topics that we're going to go over and discuss today.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,719
Let's go ahead and jump right in.

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,119
So first off, what does the Apogee SO Oxygen Sensors measure?

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,019
They measure the gaseous oxygen,

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,700
whether that's in soil or in the air or in a chamber

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,790
it's gaseous versus oxygen that is in liquid.

13
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:37,549
That is dissolved oxygen.

14
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:43,027
Apogee Instruments does not actually carry a dissolved oxygen sensor.

15
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:47,280
What is the difference from the SO-100 and SO-200 series?

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,219
So to answer this question, we are going to pull up the website here.

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,140
So here we are at apogeeinstruments.com.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,198
Let's just come over here to oxygen

19
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,289
sensors and then across the bottom here,

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,010
we're going to scroll down to get to our

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,160
products and then we're going to compare them.

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,039
So let's click on the four options,

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,320
the four different sensors that

24
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,819
we sell here and hit compare selected.

25
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,989
Now the simple answer is the difference

26
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,719
between the SO-100 and SO-200 series

27
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,109
is the signal size versus response time

28
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,609
and those are the two trade-offs.

29
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:30,030
The sensitivity you can see on the 100

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,400
series here and here is about 2.6 millivolts per percent O2.

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,880
That sensitivity does vary by sensor and then the 200 series is around 0.6.

32
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,239
So the way that equates to us here in Logan is

33
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,969
that at 20.9% ambient air oxygen that's around 50

34
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,509
millivolts and for the 200 series its

35
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,480
around 12 millivolts at 20.9 % oxygen.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,320
So you can see a difference in signal size there and then

37
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,199
the trade-off is your response time the

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,700
200 series have the response time around 14 seconds,

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,219
whereas, the response time of of the 100 series is 60 seconds;

40
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,979
so larger signal longer response time.

41
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:25,750
Next, do I need to measure the sensor body temperature?

42
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:31,680
The answer is well it depends on what your application temperature is.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,460
So if you're using the SO 110 series and you look between 15 and 35 degrees C

44
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,800
you can see there's very little temperature compensation

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,700
that you need to account for,

46
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,519
so you may not even need to measure

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
the sensory body temperature.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,219
If however, you're outside these ranges

49
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:49,979
or you're using the SO 200 series

50
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,319
then yes you definitely want to measure the sensor body temperature

51
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,199
and then makes those corrections accordingly.

52
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,399
So the answer is,

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,110
should I choose a thermistor or a

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,986
thermocouple mode?

55
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:04,919
The answer is it's up to you.

56
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,139
Whatever your particular data logger is or

57
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,259
data acquisition unit or

58
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,799
which one you prefer that's what you should go with.

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
If you don't know,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,340
it's our recommendation to go with the thermistor.

61
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,920
We think they make better and

62
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,659
more accurate measurements but it is up to you.

63
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,740
Do you have to have the heater powered to read the oxygen?

64
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,120
The answer's no,

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,060
you can read the oxygen without the heater being plugged in,

66
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,439
however, if you're anywhere where the water can condense

67
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,780
on the membrane then you are

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,140
going to want to have that heater plugged in so

69
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,179
that it is always evaporating offset and

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,020
giving you those accurate oxygen readings.

71
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,733
How do I measure the oxygen?

72
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:51,049
So this is our wiring diagram for the thermistor models

73
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,439
either the SO-110 or SO-210 models.

74
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,680
And the red and the black right here,

75
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,049
that's your oxygen reading you can do it

76
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,700
either single edit or differential

77
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,768
measurement but just by reading the

78
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,360
voltage right there on the red and the

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
black that's going to get you your oxygen.

80
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,150
Then you have you're clear

81
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,700
right here and that's just a ground, and

82
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:17,180
then you have your green orange and

83
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,918
white and that so you can make the

84
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,930
thermistor measurement, and then you

85
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,160
have your red and blue and that is just your heater.

86
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,660
So three different components doing three different things,

87
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,939
but to read oxygen you just need to be

88
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,988
able to read the voltage off of the red and black.

89
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:35,500
Which accessory head should I choose?

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,579
Well if you're in a room or a chamber you may not need anything.

91
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,979
You can just have it sitting there or reading,

92
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,379
however, you'd like it to be installed.

93
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:47,060
If you're in soil, media, dirt, or the ground,

94
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,079
then I recommend the AO-001 diffusion head,

95
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,599
and then if you're in a lab somewhere you want the

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,280
tubes connected the quarter-inch tubes

97
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,489
then go with the AO-002, so you can

98
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,290
just connect that quarter inch tubing to.

99
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,760
That concludes our brief oxygen

introduction feel free to email us with any questions.

101
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,469
Thank you very much.
