00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,318
hi my name is john huber and in this

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,759
video we'll be going over a quick set of

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,759
instructions on how to set up a

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,759
laboratory spectroradiometer for

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,519
reflectance measurements

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,960
now for these reflectance measurements

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,679
you're going to need a few things you're

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,719
going to need obviously your

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,320
spectroradiometer the computer that

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,879
it'll interface with

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,000
a reflectance standard

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,799
a stable light source in my case i'm

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,800
going to use a reflectance probe with a

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,439
flashlight built into it

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,079
and the unit's fiber optic cable

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,199
now as far as reflectance standards go

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,878
i've got a sheet of spectral on here it

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,120
is the same material as our

19
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:47,599
as004 reflectance standard so

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,000
this material reflects

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
all light within the spectroradiometer's

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,359
sensitivity range and so it'll work very

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,359
well as a light reference

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,920
so the first step to setting up your

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,079
spectroradiometer will be

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,079
first to make sure you've got stellarnet

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
spectrois installed and working on your

28
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,560
computer

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,239
after that you're going to want to make

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,920
sure your spectroradiometer is plugged

31
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,759
in which mine is

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
and then after that the next step will

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,799
be to plug in the fiber optic cable

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,719
so you'll want to note the end that says

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,640
it plugs into the spectroradiometer it

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,599
has a little arrow pointing to where the

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
spectroradiometer should be

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,839
so i'm going to go ahead and plug that

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,839
end in first

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,078
and then if you're just using the fiber

41
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,000
optic cable for your reflectance

42
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,319
measurements you'll want to position it

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,118
in a fixed position

44
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,919
for

45
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,599
the duration of your measurements in my

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,799
case i'm going to put it into this

47
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,798
reflectance probe here

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,759
which will also serve as my light source

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,680
it's very important that you have a

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,319
stable light source throughout your

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,320
measurements

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,920
so once you've got everything hooked up

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,679
the next thing you'll want to do is

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,040
start up

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
spectro is

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,319
and to do that we do recommend that you

57
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,719
run it as an administrator so i'm going

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,119
to go ahead and navigate to its install

59
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,120
directory on the c drive

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
program files

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
stellarnet

62
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,439
spectrawiz

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,439
and then the executable is this swd file

64
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,598
i'm going to right click it and run it

65
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,000
as an administrator doing this makes

66
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,000
sure the program has the

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,639
privileges that it needs to function

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
properly otherwise windows is going to

69
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,878
create some false files in another

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,000
directory that you'll need to delete for

71
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,000
the program to work right

72
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,799
so once you've got stellarnet spectrawiz

73
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,518
running you're going to want to make

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,239
sure you're in scope mode so select view

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,879
and scope mode

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,400
and then once you've got that set up

77
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,959
you'll want to make sure your light

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,039
source is on so i'm going to turn

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,560
the little flashlight in my probe here

80
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,318
on

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,360
and then you're going to position your

82
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,399
fiber optic cable over your reflectant

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,400
standard target

84
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,919
now once you've got it positioned over

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,319
the target your next step is to optimize

86
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,039
the integration time

87
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,799
so

88
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,519
when you're optimizing the integration

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,920
time your goal is to make sure that this

90
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,039
graph here occupies as much of the

91
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,318
y-axis here as possible without cutting

92
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,280
off at the top

93
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,399
so right now the graph is too low i'm

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,318
going to show you what it looks like

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,080
when it's too high

96
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,479
so you go view

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,799
there you go setup detector integration

98
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,119
time

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
and to make the graph go higher you

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
simply increase this integration time

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
number to make it go lower you decrease

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,799
it so i'm going to increase it by too

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,840
much

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
just as an example

105
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,878
so as you can see

106
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,959
the graph is cutting off slightly at the

107
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,759
top here which means my integration time

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,000
is too high i need to bring it down

109
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,039
so i'll go set up detector integration

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
time

111
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:13,598
i'm going to bring it down a little bit

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,280
to 14.50 here now your integration time

113
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,120
is going to vary depending on the

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,798
brightness of your light source the

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,680
brighter the light source the lower your

116
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,000
integration time will be

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
so in this case this integration time

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,519
looks like it's good it's occupying a

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
good portion of the y-axis but it's not

120
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,000
being cut off at all

121
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,758
so we're gonna let it sit for a while to

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
make sure it's stable

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,400
which it looks like it is

124
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,680
so once it's stable your next step is to

125
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,679
obtain a dark scan

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,840
so the key to obtaining a good dark skin

127
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,839
is just to make sure that there's no

128
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,000
light getting into your

129
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,079
spectroradiometer so for this procedure

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,040
i'm going to unplug the fiber optic

131
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,478
cable

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,479
and then cover the opening port

133
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,198
and when you do this you should see a

134
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,520
nice flat line at the bottom it's okay

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
if there are some tiny bumps in it we're

136
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,399
going to flatten those out with the dark

137
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,198
skin

138
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,959
so

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,280
i prefer to release old dark skins first

140
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,038
this is optional but usually it leads to

141
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,478
better dark scans overall in my

142
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,120
experience

143
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,719
so to release an old dark skin you'll

144
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
want to right click

145
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,560
this button here

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,879
with the dark scan icon

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,280
and when you do that you'll notice that

148
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,120
a small square forms in the lower left

149
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,839
corner of the graph that means that the

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,038
old dark skin has been

151
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,758
erased and when you're ready to save a

152
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,680
new dark scan just left click the button

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,439
here

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,478
you'll notice the line is nice and flat

155
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,800
along the bottom and the value down here

156
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,599
is bouncing very close to zero it'll

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,840
vary by a bit but it should always

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,400
remain close to zero

159
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,038
so now that we've got a good dark scan

160
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,359
i'm going to plug the fiber optic cable

161
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,360
back in

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
and then i'm going to

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,918
replace

164
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,198
the probe over there standard

165
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,198
and then we're going to make sure that

166
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,560
our integration time still looks good

167
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,199
which

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,079
it still occupies most of the y-axis

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
here so that's still a good integration

170
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,959
time

171
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,879
so once you've got your dark skin and

172
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,439
your integration time set

173
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,399
the next thing you need to do is go into

174
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,120
transmission mode so you go view

175
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,120
transmission

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,840
and now the next step after that

177
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,478
is simply to click this light reference

178
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,560
button here

179
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,120
and that will establish your reflectance

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,478
standard as the standard for 100

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
reflectance

182
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,719
and at this point you are now ready to

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
start taking reflectance measurements so

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,000
i'm just going to take a quick

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
measurement off of the black tabletop

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
here

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,319
as you can see the black tabletop is

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,280
absorbing most of the visible spectrum

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,680
but is beginning to reflect the far red

190
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,239
spectrum beyond 700 nanometers which

191
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,800
we'd expect to see

192
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
so once you have a good spectrum and

193
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,840
you're satisfied with it and you want to

194
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,319
save it

195
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,679
you go up to file

196
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,080
save

197
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,079
sample

198
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,959
you'll pick a location to save your file

199
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,918
and give it a name i'm going to call

200
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,918
this one test

201
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,680
and now this window comes up it allows

202
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,038
you to define your starting wavelength

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
your ending wavelength and your

204
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,199
wavelength increments for this file i'm

205
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,960
going to just keep the starting and

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,520
ending wavelengths and then change the

207
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,519
wavelength increments to 1 nanometer

208
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,359
once you've done that you click ok

209
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
and your spectrum is saved

210
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
and now if you want to open your

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,038
spectrum up in a program like microsoft

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
excel all you need to do is open up

213
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,000
excel

214
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,598
click file

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
open

216
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,878
browse to the location where you saved

217
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
your file

218
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,479
and then you want to make sure that

219
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,439
excel is looking for all files and not

220
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,719
just excel files

221
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,800
find your file and open it

222
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,360
and then you want to make sure it's

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,280
delimited

224
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,959
by spaces

225
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,000
click finish

226
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,639
and there's our spectrum file

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,038
and that concludes the brief tutorial on

228
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,519
how to take a reflectance measurement

229
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,519
thank you for watching
