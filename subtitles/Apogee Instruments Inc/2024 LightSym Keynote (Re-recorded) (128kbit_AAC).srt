1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments, and I'm here today to record

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:13,320
[SPEAKER_00]: the talk, the keynote talk that I gave a
few weeks ago at the Light Sim Symposia in

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Seoul, Korea.

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,000
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the very opening talk of the
conference, and it was a great honor to be

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,140
[SPEAKER_00]: asked to do this.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,580
[SPEAKER_00]: What I chose to talk about is not the
details of our photobiology research that

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,960
[SPEAKER_00]: my students have done, especially over the
last 10 years, but as the opening talk to

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,640
[SPEAKER_00]: the symposia of research scientists,
I wanted to talk about more about the

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,280
[SPEAKER_00]: process of science and how we use our
instruments and tools to create new

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,060
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So these next few slides are what I showed
there.

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,820
[SPEAKER_00]: My opening slide was this.

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:06,320
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture drawn by an artist here
in Utah, James Christiansen, of a home

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,920
[SPEAKER_00]: tinkerer taking his new spaceship out for
a drive in the space.

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just loved this picture.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's framed in my laboratory, but he's got
all these gizmos that he rigged up.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,620
[SPEAKER_00]: This is far from high tech.

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,620
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think the title of this was low
tech, but this is what we all do in our

19
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,860
[SPEAKER_00]: research laboratories, tinker with things.

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Build gizmos, test hypotheses.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,140
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much different than a commercial
enterprise that might all be built out of

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,980
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel and something fancy.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,720
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the name of the symposium,
LightSim 2024.

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,560
[SPEAKER_00]: This drew several hundred research
scientists really from all over the world.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,620
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was truly a great honor for me to
give the opening talk of this.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of that, it's light and
photosynthesis and photons.

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,800
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start with a review of where
we have come with creating light for

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,980
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves over the past 150 years.

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,300
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from a paper in the journal
Nature, which I published with some

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,980
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, LEDs for photons, physiology
and food.

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this review paper, we talked about
the history of light.

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,520
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with kerosene lamps.

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,480
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the energy in the kerosene and
how much light did we out?

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is light measured in lumens per
watt of power going into this.

35
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Point four, now you can see the tremendous
breakthrough when we got incandescent

36
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,280
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs went from point four to 15.

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,440
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an incredible advance.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that was a 40 fold increase
of turning energy into light.

39
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is all for people, but plant
research, as I'll show in a minute,

40
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,400
[SPEAKER_00]: has followed this.

41
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in about, just after World War II,
in about 1950, we got fluorescent lights.

42
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:13,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was another big advance from 15
to 80, but that was a five fold increase.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,480
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was huge advance for everybody to
more light, less heat.

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the 1970s, we got high intensity
discharge lighting.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,240
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high pressure sodium bulb,
80 to 120, another huge advance.

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're only talking 1.5 X, but each of
these allowed us to do more plant research

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,100
[SPEAKER_00]: with mostly with higher intensities of
light.

48
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,700
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't doing so much back here with
ratios of colors as just getting the

49
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,000
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity up, but we still used a lot of
colored filters to create different ratios

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,680
[SPEAKER_00]: of colors.

51
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my early papers right in here
were using HID and metal halide lamps with

52
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,640
[SPEAKER_00]: filters to get different colors of light.

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,680
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kaboom, we got LEDs.

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly depend on when you say we started
10 or 20 years ago.

55
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, another huge breakthrough in
terms of ratios of heat and light.

56
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,100
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for human lighting, lumens per
watt.

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,980
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do this in micromoles of photons
per joule of energy, and this is the ratio

58
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,100
[SPEAKER_00]: for energy and photons out, here's the
comparative numbers, and look at this,

59
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,700
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.005 to four.

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,980
[SPEAKER_00]: This is almost a 1,000-fold increase in
light.

61
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And even here, even if we start with
incandescents, a tremendous breakthrough.

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we get all the colors, we get very
efficient lights so we can have high

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,240
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,820
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we're all assembled here for
LightSim to talk about our exciting work

65
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,040
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can now do with LEDs.

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,880
[SPEAKER_00]: This ratio, let me go back one,
this is really light to heat.

67
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Lumens is light, watts is heat.

68
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Micromoles of photons is photon flux
density, and joules is energy.

69
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the ratio of these two.

70
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,900
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is sunlight?

71
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,200
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out sunlight has two micromoles
of photosynthetic photons per joule of

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,740
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal energy.

73
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,440
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think about that ratio much,
but I'll show you, it's not difficult to

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,040
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate for sunlight.

75
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have LEDs that are three and they
even exceed three micromoles per joule.

76
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on this basis, it's staggering,
because look, we've caught up and passed

77
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,260
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight with our human technology.

78
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,340
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an incredible that we've done
that.

79
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have said, yes,
so now we don't need sunlight anymore.

80
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric lights are even better than
sunlight.

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,920
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at this, this joule of energy
right here.

82
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get that back right here and get my
pen turned on.

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,920
[SPEAKER_00]: This joule of energy right here is
electricity.

84
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,180
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to pay for that joule of energy.

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,400
[SPEAKER_00]: This joule is free from the sunlight.

86
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,860
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with the sun.

87
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,220
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get two micromoles for free and we
pay for these three.

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So sunlight is still a tremendous source
of light because it's free compared to

89
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,320
[SPEAKER_00]: electric lights, but it's still three to
two.

90
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we get two?

91
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,620
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a spectra of wavelength of
sunlight and intensity here.

92
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,480
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a classic.

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee has refrigerator magnets with this
spectra on it.

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,220
[SPEAKER_00]: This part right here we say visible is
really photosynthetic photon flux.

95
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And this red part out here is thermal,
doesn't drive photosynthesis, drives

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,260
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation of water, it drives
transpiration, but it doesn't drive

97
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,120
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.

98
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,520
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this, this is two and
three based on this ratio of this.

99
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we include far-red photons in
this, that's this zone right here.

100
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,500
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to 700 nanometers.

101
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,900
[SPEAKER_00]: This shifts this over slightly.

102
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So now a greater fraction of sunlight is
photosynthetic radiation.

103
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll come back to this in this talk a
bit, but as most of you know, this is a

104
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,300
[SPEAKER_00]: huge part of the research of my students
and I, of the value of these far-red

105
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,900
[SPEAKER_00]: photons.

106
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,600
[SPEAKER_00]: If we include this, this number gets
slightly bigger.

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,460
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.3 micromoles per joule for sunlight.

108
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,380
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still not trying to catch up to
electric lights.

109
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,800
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to get favorable ratios
of heat, of light to heat.

110
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do that well, we can air
condition greenhouses.

111
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that seems cost prohibitive now,
but let me show you the innovations in

112
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,560
[SPEAKER_00]: glass that allows us to do that.

113
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,260
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, once again, here is our,
let me get this in black right here.

114
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,840
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our PPFD.

115
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as visible light right here,
draw a line right there.

116
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,880
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the good part.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,940
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a lot of this.

118
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,620
[SPEAKER_00]: This is standard glass that we've had for
a hundred years.

119
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,420
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put a coating on this, it slightly
decreases visible, but it dramatically

120
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,660
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases the heat.

121
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we put more coating, even more and
even more, so all of a sudden we have

122
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,100
[SPEAKER_00]: almost pure light and very little thermal,
unusable thermal out here.

123
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,920
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use a low solar gain glass,
we can air condition greenhouses.

124
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,700
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to quantify this.

125
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,620
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Apogee cell is a flotilla of
sensors to rigorously quantify these

126
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,300
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios.

127
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,860
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a cutting edge of photobiology
and food production in highly controlled

128
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,300
[SPEAKER_00]: environments is to use the right kinds of
solar glazing.

129
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can close a greenhouse, not only
reduce the air conditioning costs,

130
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,100
[SPEAKER_00]: but allow us to seal it and elevate CO2,
take advantage of high CO2.

131
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,800
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from innovations in glazing.

132
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back to the history of
photobiology to the 1950s.

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,860
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we were working with
fluorescent tubes.

134
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Caltech University in California,
Fritz Wendt did his pioneering work.

135
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,520
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a famous, famous scientist
credited with the discovery of oxen.

136
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's his work from a plant physiology
textbook on oxen of the hormone oxen.

137
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote this book, The Experimental
Control of Plant Growth.

138
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,980
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful book about all these
discoveries of photoperiod and temperature

139
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,780
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.

140
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in this famous Caltech
Phytotron where they could wheel carts

141
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,520
[SPEAKER_00]: from different temperatures of rooms and
different lights of rooms, all done with

142
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,880
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent lights.

143
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of his famous quotes are he urged
everybody to work in controlled

144
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,160
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, do more basic research,
understand things at a very fundamental

145
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,980
[SPEAKER_00]: level.

146
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have way better tools than he
ever had to do this.

147
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,760
[SPEAKER_00]: He advocated for very simple experiments.

148
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Complex experiments.

149
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was very suspicious of studies that
needed a lot of statistics, where he had a

150
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,340
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of treatments and a lot of statistics.

151
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,720
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted fundamental data with more clear
results.

152
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:15,760
[SPEAKER_00]: That continues to be very wise advice for
all of us 50 years later to do simple

153
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,500
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments with clear results,
where we associate mechanisms with

154
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,920
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental results.

155
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to build on this concept now in my
next few slides.

156
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Another famous scientist, Ernest
Rutherford, Nobel Prize in Chemistry,

157
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
[SPEAKER_00]: 1908.

158
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Ernest Rutherford with his
primitive tools of the time working out

159
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,980
[SPEAKER_00]: breakthroughs in chemistry.

160
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,240
[SPEAKER_00]: What did he have to say about statistics?

161
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh, if your experiment needs statistics,
you ought to have done a better

162
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,540
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.

163
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,400
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still wise advice.

164
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Do simple experiments with clear results,
not complex experiments that need a ton of

165
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,280
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics to interpret them.

166
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that statistics is a bad thing.

167
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,000
[SPEAKER_00]: We all use it.

168
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:12,280
[SPEAKER_00]: It's critical, but we shouldn't rely on
the crutch of statistics to design our

169
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,960
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,740
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be clear fundamental tests of
hypotheses.

171
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we design experiments that are
more like a fishing trip than real

172
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,220
[SPEAKER_00]: research.

173
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,840
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to do a lot of stuff and
see what happens.

174
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck getting your proposals funded if
the reviewers think they might be a

175
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,600
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing trip.

176
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Serendipity plays a huge role in science.

177
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,660
[SPEAKER_00]: We still go for what we're looking for,
but people, the public thinks the most

178
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,580
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting phrase in all of science is,
ah, Eureka, I just discovered it.

179
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not how it works.

180
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,280
[SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting phrase is, that's funny.

181
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,900
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an outlier here.

182
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Who said that?

183
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Isaac Asimov, famous science fiction
writer, and that's highlighted in this

184
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,860
[SPEAKER_00]: book, Serendipitous Discoveries in Plant
Science.

185
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,800
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never plan for serendipity.

186
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,480
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be doing good science,
but you have to have a trained mind to

187
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,180
[SPEAKER_00]: understand when there's good data and when
there's bad data.

188
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all need to train our minds to be
looking for these unusual data when they

189
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,720
[SPEAKER_00]: arise.

190
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Another famous scientist, Louis Pasteur,

191
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,980
[SPEAKER_00]: 1800s, chance favors the prepared mind.

192
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,420
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of his most famous quotes.

193
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just loved this my whole career,
studying in graduate school to get my

194
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,460
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared mind for that chance moment.

195
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,220
[SPEAKER_00]: What that really means is when you have
data like this, and now you say,

196
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,820
[SPEAKER_00]: eh, here's my curve for the response.

197
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this in yellow.

198
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my curve for the response.

199
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that data point.

200
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,760
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an outlier.

201
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,180
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take it out.

202
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,080
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know that's an outlier?

203
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you can draw a nice smooth
curve for the rest of the data,

204
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,320
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be looking at outliers and
understanding what caused them.

205
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,740
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this quote is so famous.

206
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, when you read his original
stuff, one, two, three, four, five words,

207
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,340
[SPEAKER_00]: how elegant is that?

208
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,440
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what he originally said.

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,600
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in the fields of observation,
chance favors only the prepared mind.

210
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,840
[SPEAKER_00]: So subsequent editors said, we can do
better than that.

211
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that out, take that out.

212
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,980
[SPEAKER_00]: We got his five words, but that was edited
from his original quote.

213
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,580
[SPEAKER_00]: That speaks to the value of editing in our
writing too.

214
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:55,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a famous saying, everybody believes
a measurement except the person who made

215
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:55,740
[SPEAKER_00]: it.

216
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an amazing thing to say as an
instrument company, we're all about making

217
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,860
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, but some of those
measurements are so hard to make,

218
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,500
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to be skeptical of your own data,
even if other people believe it.

219
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,840
[SPEAKER_00]: No one believes a model except the person
who made it.

220
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that make models say,
I've modeled this, I know all about it.

221
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,700
[SPEAKER_00]: What this really means is we should be
more skeptical of measurements and do more

222
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:31,200
[SPEAKER_00]: careful models, but more than anything,
it's the combination of measurements and

223
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,380
[SPEAKER_00]: models that leads to knowledge.

224
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,960
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go back and forth between these
and all of our science.

225
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Too often, we make too many measurements
without the underlying principles,

226
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,240
[SPEAKER_00]: without connecting them to theory,
and it leads to bad data.

227
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do only models, we lead to crazy
models not connected to reality.

228
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,060
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the back and forth interaction that
helps us proceed in science.

229
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,520
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used this analogy of a person
going to the top of a house on two step

230
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:06,860
[SPEAKER_00]: ladders.

231
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,280
[SPEAKER_00]: One step ladder is measurements,
one is theory or models, and you get to

232
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,360
[SPEAKER_00]: the top faster if you take one step on
each ladder and you go back and forth and

233
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,140
[SPEAKER_00]: you get right up to the top of the house.

234
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,520
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get there by making only
measurements, but pretty hard to jump on

235
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,200
[SPEAKER_00]: one step in a ladder or one step here.

236
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,580
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to go back and forth.

237
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a sense of back and forth,
I made this little diagram.

238
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's theory and knowledge far apart,
back and forth, back and forth.

239
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,860
[SPEAKER_00]: We gain wisdom as we go.

240
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,580
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we move those closer together?

241
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,440
[SPEAKER_00]: High frequency back and forth.

242
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,540
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a lot faster knowledge.

243
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we are in Korea.

244
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:57,920
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can conclude theory and measurement
within the same person, that's really

245
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,020
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient for advancing science.

246
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,840
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point here is become excellent at
making measurements, but become equally

247
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,140
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement, equally excellent at learning
the theory and the underlying principles

248
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,780
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.

249
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's shift for a few slides on
photobiology.

250
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,320
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a paper by Brodersen and
Vogtman many years ago.

251
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,240
[SPEAKER_00]: They did optics of light.

252
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,980
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant, a side view of a plant
leaf.

253
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,440
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty famous picture.

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the top of the leaf.

255
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can get this in here.

256
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,120
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

257
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the bottom of the leaf.

258
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light penetrates better than red and
blue.

259
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,140
[SPEAKER_00]: We think these are so photosynthetic
efficient, but they're absorbed in that

260
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,020
[SPEAKER_00]: very top layer.

261
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Green penetrates this.

262
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Green is underappreciated value.

263
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just does it penetrate a leaf,
but it penetrates the whole canopy to the

264
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,460
[SPEAKER_00]: next leaf below.

265
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,980
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the basis for a lot of our
findings, just this simple concept of red,

266
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,660
[SPEAKER_00]: green, and blue.

267
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,560
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I would like to add another
wavelength to this.

268
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,260
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't really call it a color.

269
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,040
[SPEAKER_00]: I put far-red in here.

270
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of our data is clear that far-red
has photosynthetic value.

271
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you that we've shifted
definitions of photosynthetic wavelengths

272
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,180
[SPEAKER_00]: for this.

273
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,560
[SPEAKER_00]: But far-red is also very penetrating in
plant canopies and in leaves.

274
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we only study single leaves.

275
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,020
[SPEAKER_00]: We underappreciate the value of these
colors in canopies.

276
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,780
[SPEAKER_00]: This concept of one, two, three,
and adding a fourth category has really

277
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,800
[SPEAKER_00]: helped advance our science in this.

278
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the profound impact.

279
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce, more than any other crop lettuce,
is really response to far-red.

280
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell division, cell enlargement.

281
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,280
[SPEAKER_00]: We add a little bit of far-red,
and we more than double growth of the

282
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,580
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.

283
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,780
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination of photosynthetic
photons and cell expansion and cell

284
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,400
[SPEAKER_00]: division cause associated with far-red.

285
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call this the shade response,
but we can trick the plants to thinking

286
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in the shade when they're in the
sunlight.

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,800
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a powerful image of the
importance of far-red.

288
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:34,760
[SPEAKER_00]: This had led to a shift in how we define
photosynthetic photon flux density.

289
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 400 to 700, the conventional
definition that we've used for half a

290
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,780
[SPEAKER_00]: century.

291
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:49,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's extended photosynthetic photon flux
density with another 50 nanometers out

292
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,300
[SPEAKER_00]: here of photosynthetic photons.

293
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this part right here that
resulted in that lettuce plant,

294
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,600
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous increase in growth.

295
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,000
[SPEAKER_00]: What we advocate is measure and report
both of these in papers.

296
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand the growth per unit
old definition, but also for the new

297
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,560
[SPEAKER_00]: definition EPPFD.

298
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,780
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're learning when does this
apply and when does it not?

299
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,500
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Paul Kosuma.

300
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,740
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his PhD with me.

301
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,080
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at Wageningen now.

302
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,900
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the paper that resulted in this.

303
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:37,360
[SPEAKER_00]: These were studies with lettuce at three
intensities, a very low intensity of 100

304
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,100
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per meter squared per second,
doubling to 200 and then doubling again to

305
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,060
[SPEAKER_00]: 500.

306
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an excellent wavelength.

307
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we added far-red,
percent far-red.

308
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,480
[SPEAKER_00]: We added up to 30% and the lettuce
responded.

309
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,760
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that picture came from in the
previous slide right here.

310
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,280
[SPEAKER_00]: If we only gave them lower light,
that line is flat.

311
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:08,220
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no benefit of far-red if the
light intensity was low.

312
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,340
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with what we call substitution.

313
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,660
[SPEAKER_00]: As we added far-red photons, we took away
traditional photons.

314
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So the EPPFD was exactly the same.

315
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were in very low light,
it was actually inhibitory.

316
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,720
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed those shorter wavelength
photons.

317
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do when we do this?

318
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,200
[SPEAKER_00]: We normalize percent of control.

319
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the data normalized to one
here.

320
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with the trend becomes very clear.

321
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Far-red was far more beneficial with a
higher total background of photon flux

322
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,740
[SPEAKER_00]: than a lower background.

323
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,120
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna be followed up by a lot of
people, I'm sure, but it's a very

324
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,720
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating interaction of far-red photons
and total amount of light, which again,

325
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,460
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to measure both.

326
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinach, you would think, responds like
lettuce, but it's a different genus.

327
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,080
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different species.

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,560
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our studies with spinach have shown
it's much, much less sensitive to far-red

329
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,360
[SPEAKER_00]: photons.

330
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,680
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture.

331
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's far-red percentage, same as the
other one.

332
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of data points, it's a picture.

333
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:33,980
[SPEAKER_00]: This 100, 200, 500, the same study,
far-red minimally increase growth.

334
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth increases a lot with more
intensity, but more far-red minimal

335
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,580
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.

336
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,460
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these pictures are similar here.

337
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,800
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot to learn about
interactions of far-red with photon flux.

338
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,880
[SPEAKER_00]: These studies were done by Noah Langenfeld
in my laboratory.

339
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,460
[SPEAKER_00]: We're following up on these interactions
with other species.

340
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating photobiology.

341
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a very powerful tool.

342
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,200
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna hear numerous talks in this
conference about all these principles

343
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,480
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to plants.

344
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be here.

345
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to hear all these talks.

346
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for listening.
