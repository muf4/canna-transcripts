Hello I'm Devin Overly, and I'm excited to introduce to you

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,859
the new AL-120 leveling plate and mounting bracket system.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,740
This replaces our old AM-110 and AL-100, which were over engineered

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,240
and designed to work with a lot of different sensors.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,879
The AL-120 is at a lower price point and is custom designed to work with Apogee radiation sensors.

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,239
It has a lot of other benefits as well.

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:30,479
It all starts with this wave spring, made out of 17-7 stainless steel

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,619
that has excellent fatigue properties, good corrosion resistance, and minimal heat distortion.

9
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:42,820
Another benefit is that it has captive hardware, so you don't drop the screws nuts or washers

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,799
in the snow when you have a polar bear snuffling up your backside. Don't ask!

11
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:53,500
One of the headaches with the old system, was that you would level the sensor on the mounting bracket,

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,579
tighten the screws,  the sensor goes out of level; rinse and repeat.

13
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:07,000
With the new AL-120 and the wave spring, you mount the sensor, level it, and it's done.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,280
Saving you valuable time because again polar bears.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,379
The new AL-120, sure to be a hit with field installers and purchasing agents alike,

16
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,179
not so much with the polar bears.
