1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
clock and welcome everyone back to

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:12,359
lecture number three we're gonna talk

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,609
about long wave today and then hopefully

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,618
I made an outline here today of the

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:24,750
objective for the next 50 minutes or so

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:28,740
to get the total net radiation before I

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:34,679
start and then so we're somewhere in

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:38,128
here we get these to go I made a small

9
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,200
error and and people say there are no

10
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:44,308
small errors there there's no small

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,750
typos there's their typos yesterday when

12
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:51,599
I did this we have a thousand N and

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:56,399
fifty percent reflected so so fifty

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,620
percent was absorbed so the shortwave in

15
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,429
was five hundred that's correct

16
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:05,849
this reflection right here is a hundred

17
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:09,840
and I said irrelevantly you have a

18
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:13,169
hundred that means six hundred watts are

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,000
absorbed but some people correctly said

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:25,290
wait a minute this hundred is also x one

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,430
minus the albedo and so this really is

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:36,000
50 and the correct answers 500 not 600

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:40,549
550 thank you this is over here 500 plus

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,549
55 50 and

25
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:48,179
this 50 is quite a bit of energy so it's

26
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:50,828
not really a small error but it's also

27
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:52,750
it's important that this is correct

28
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:55,809
because sometimes this reflection is

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,509
huge if you get something on the south

30
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,629
side of a building this reflected energy

31
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:04,829
can be a lot more than 10% in some cases

32
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:09,969
in this example it's not so big but it's

33
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:12,729
depends on the case so we've got this

34
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:15,068
diagram up here with arrows in and

35
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:18,789
arrows out and this is a pretty messy

36
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:24,399
diagram but it's useful to have diagrams

37
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:29,519
like this because it helps you keep

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:33,759
track of the inputs and the outputs so

39
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:37,060
some years ago we made this diagram and

40
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:40,090
I have this as a handout the inputs and

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,590
the outputs I need to go up just

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:49,239
slightly to see the whole works there it

43
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,009
is and all this is a nicer diagram of

44
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,989
this I guess the sun's on the right-hand

45
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:57,719
side now but solar in with this arrow

46
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:01,450
we've talked about

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,579
oops sorry this is sky radiation coming

48
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:07,179
in here which we didn't talk about yet

49
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:11,349
here's solar in some bounces off here's

50
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,659
reflected same thing these big fat curvy

51
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:16,298
lines what want to talk about today long

52
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,939
wave radiation calculating these and

53
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:21,299
then of course we get outgoing

54
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:24,759
transpiration conduction convection and

55
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:28,329
here's some long wave components here

56
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:31,479
coming into the leaf long wave means the

57
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:34,000
wavelengths are long and so we draw

58
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,250
those with curvy lines and short wave is

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,539
the way with wavelengths are short so we

60
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,729
draw those with straight lines

61
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:43,659
and then finally here's soil heat flux

62
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:45,878
when we calculate that so a diagram to

63
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:48,668
keep the components straight and then

64
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,728
the goal then in a quantitative sense is

65
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,860
put numbers on the arrows and add them

66
00:03:51,729 --> 00:04:01,910
up make sure it balanced

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:04,220
this issue of a diagram is something

68
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,199
that everybody that teaches this makes

69
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:09,770
some kind of the diagram of their own

70
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,780
and here is part nobles diagram of

71
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:15,800
exactly the same thing out of this

72
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:19,629
chapter that we're using it's slightly

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,490
different arrows and it's in some ways

74
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:25,040
these real fat arrows for infrared

75
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,500
radiation kind of overemphasize if you

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,740
scaled these to the rough size of their

77
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,189
numbers the biggest arrow in here would

78
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,439
be direct radiation right there coming

79
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:40,420
into the system that's ultimately what

80
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:45,170
drives the whole thing but these are

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:48,140
diagrams to help people see this so

82
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,090
here's the one I love so I've read this

83
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,129
stuff every time a new textbooks comes

84
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,439
out I read the chapter on radiation and

85
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,600
I think oh that's a nice diagram and

86
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,879
this explains it a little better and you

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,420
know I keep thinking of other ways to

88
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:06,409
teach it but one of my favorites is the

89
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:10,580
textbook that we use on campus animal

90
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:16,820
physiology the third edition so you turn

91
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:20,120
to chapter 16 animal energetics and

92
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:23,959
temperature relations and this is not

93
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,480
just metabolism because respirations big

94
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:30,949
in in animals much bigger than people

95
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,870
but so is all the fluxes of long-wave so

96
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,899
you turn the page to this authors

97
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,418
diagram this I just love this

98
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:41,299
hippopotamus with exact same arrows

99
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:45,049
reflected he's got a little tiny bit of

100
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:49,370
evaporation infrared thermal radiation

101
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,319
so that point that this is everybody's

102
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,970
got their diagram and once you get these

103
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,990
principles you start applying them to

104
00:05:52,970 --> 00:06:01,040
everything a hot tool laid out in the

105
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,110
Sun and now how hot it gets you can even

106
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,000
calculate how fast your laundry will dry

107
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,800
on the clothesline went depending on the

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,269
wind speed and solar radiation from this

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,040
so where we left off oh I have one more

110
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,709
diagram I want to show you before we get

111
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,660
there couple from the book to link this

112
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:23,849
to the book here was my picture

113
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,640
yesterday of shortwave and all the

114
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,450
components and then this big clump of

115
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:34,229
thermal long wave so Park Nobel has that

116
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:36,089
diagram as well in the book only I like

117
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,060
my diagram a little better than his

118
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:43,799
because he shows the same thing but he

119
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:46,399
hasn't on a vlog scale and I'm not a big

120
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,490
fan of vlog scales for teaching because

121
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,620
they they distort things so look at his

122
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,019
infrared radiation by the leaf it looks

123
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,780
like this sharp peak and if this was not

124
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:00,539
a log scale it looks like this but it's

125
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,639
the same data direct solar and he has

126
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,950
some reflected skylight in here and he

127
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,779
also shows wave number wavelength is

128
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,969
simpler but it's still relative fluxes

129
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,839
and if you look at it long enough it's

130
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:18,470
the exact same diagram just log scale he

131
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,469
also has

132
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,769
this diagram which was on the bottom of

133
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:31,639
one of the handouts for this Stefan

134
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:33,228
Boltzmann equation radiation emitted in

135
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,538
watts per meter squared and surface

136
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:37,610
temperature an important thing about

137
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,908
this this is a nice big diagram but if

138
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,028
you put a pencil on here and you put a

139
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:46,639
ruler on here and you put 25 degrees

140
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:49,249
you're pretty close to 400 watts per

141
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,860
meter squared which is useful to

142
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:54,439
remember because we're talking about a

143
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,110
thousand here but we're talking about

144
00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:02,379
fluxes of 400 and long-wave so they're

145
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:05,960
not trivial fluxes at room temperature

146
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:08,899
so this would all be terrific if we just

147
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,878
calculated temperature we've multiplied

148
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:14,769
it by this deffend Boltzmann constant

149
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:18,999
and we could get our long-wave radiation

150
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:18,998
but in the case of long wave radiation

151
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:26,300
not everything is a perfect black body

152
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:31,908
not everything is perfectly black and

153
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,969
radiates of black some shiny objects do

154
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:40,639
not emit long wave radiation very well

155
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:45,040
at all so we get an additional symbol in

156
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:50,180
here it's lowercase t called emissivity

157
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:57,049
emissivity is 1 for a perfect black body

158
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:59,838
and the opposite extreme is a piece of

159
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:05,740
tinfoil the best common thing I can

160
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,740
think of that has a low emissivity and

161
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,879
somewhere right here I have a piece of

162
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:19,670
tinfoil

163
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:19,669
to emphasize this point and here it is

164
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:29,339
and I'm enough now we have two things

165
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:32,339
that are confusing albedo which refers

166
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,120
to shortwave radiation reflectance of

167
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:38,450
shortwave and then this thing emissivity

168
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,259
which only refers to long wave radiation

169
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:45,870
and again long wave is warm objects all

170
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,720
objects that are neither less hot than

171
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,840
the Sun in our environment the only

172
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,210
thing that's any significant source of

173
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,710
shortwave is Sun and then all the

174
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:01,680
terrestrial objects are all

175
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:08,389
back-and-forth long wave so I'm going to

176
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:12,079
put this up here I'm gonna erase this

177
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:15,559
this is pretty straightforward

178
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,560
you've got it

179
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,920
three objects and I'm my goal is that

180
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:26,809
ten years from now you'll still remember

181
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,309
this little demonstration and it'll

182
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:37,549
stick in your head and you'll have it

183
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:43,869
forever pin foil a aluminum foil where's

184
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:43,870
my marker albedo

185
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:53,379
pretty reflective of shortwave radiation

186
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:55,480
so we might say and it depends on how

187
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,119
perfect the tinfoil is if it's got

188
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:03,519
crinkles but if it's pretty perfect it's

189
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:05,740
going to have an albedo of 0.9 then look

190
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,919
this up in a book to see exactly what

191
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:13,928
people claim for this but it's high now

192
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:16,378
let's do hell just doing lb toes for a

193
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,379
second

194
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:31,839
black paper albedo zero point one might

195
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:34,539
even be blacker net but 0.1 so now we do

196
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,699
white paper and instead of drawing a

197
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:40,539
square I'm putting actual white paper up

198
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:42,548
here this white paper and if this was a

199
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:45,248
test question hundred percent people

200
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:52,629
would get this right the albedo of this

201
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:57,509
is about 0.9 plus or minus 0.05 or

202
00:11:52,629 --> 00:12:01,869
something for these okay now let's do

203
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:10,568
right below this giving ourselves plenty

204
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:15,399
of room to see it emissivity completely

205
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:20,198
different concept this is reflected this

206
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:22,720
is emitted from the surface so this as

207
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:27,719
the surface gets warm it's the ability

208
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:31,449
to give off long wave radiation a

209
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:37,149
blackbody this depending on how black it

210
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:39,938
is this might be 0.9 for the ability to

211
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,159
give off not white paper what do you

212
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:43,899
think white paper would be well hardy

213
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:54,100
can emit right it's the opposite of

214
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:58,509
black no white paper might be 0.85 maybe

215
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:03,639
even 0.9 a white surface is a fine

216
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:06,220
emitter similar to black but now let's

217
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,610
take a shiny surface any kind of

218
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:17,139
polished metal that shiny the emissivity

219
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:22,350
of aluminum foil 0.03 that's a clean

220
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:27,308
piece of aluminum foil shiny surfaces

221
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:30,139
are poor emitters so what does this mean

222
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:35,939
for energy balance

223
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:38,279
if this was hot and again let's imagine

224
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,610
we're on the moon where there's no air

225
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,970
because it simplifies it we put this on

226
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,370
a stove we get it hot we lay it out it

227
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:51,480
would take forever for this to cool off

228
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:53,639
by emitted radiation we heat this is a

229
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,950
block of metal now all right so we take

230
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,049
another block of metal that's black heat

231
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,310
it up exactly the same lay it out it

232
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:01,620
cools off right away

233
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:03,779
same thing with white they cool off

234
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,740
right away because they can emit that

235
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:11,909
radiation into space into other objects

236
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,889
on the ground and the moon simplifies it

237
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:19,889
because there's no transpiration

238
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:22,710
conduction and convection so this little

239
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:29,370
diagram helps to emphasize the

240
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:34,170
differences in emissivity and now we are

241
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:37,980
going to sacrifice part of this leaf

242
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:45,750
right here to science because the thing

243
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:50,330
we're after is leaves and that plant

244
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,330
just gave part of its life for science

245
00:14:50,629 --> 00:15:01,379
typical albedo of a leaf and I'll put

246
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:03,570
this one in green 0.25 not intuitive

247
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:08,570
it's in dreams in between black and

248
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:14,510
white but has a much lower albedo than

249
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:18,210
white paper wood emissivity of a leaf

250
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:21,769
not completely intuitive from this but

251
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:31,769
at the typical value we used for leaf is

252
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:34,259
0.96 very very high leaves emit it's

253
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,899
effectively emit radiation which also

254
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:40,120
means they can effectively cool off when

255
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,399
they as soon as they get hot

256
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:50,549
it's worth putting on here one more

257
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:50,549
thing let's see can erase this this

258
00:15:52,078 --> 00:16:01,628
water is blue right so now we're gonna

259
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,558
put mm a blue square right it's it's

260
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:10,528
full of water

261
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:10,528
all blue water has an emissivity of

262
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:19,389
about 0.9 six maybe even 0.98 it's and

263
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,269
this is why biological objects that are

264
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,789
full of water like our skin have very

265
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:28,120
high emissivity that things that are

266
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:32,498
hydrated and wet effectively emit long

267
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,899
wave radiation the albedo of water

268
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:37,680
depends up a lot on sun angle if it's

269
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:42,818
low Sun angle you get glare and a lot of

270
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,919
reflectance so and it it depends on how

271
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:47,378
clear the water is I'm not going to put

272
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:53,049
a number in here for albedo but the

273
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:56,920
point is water is a really effective

274
00:16:53,049 --> 00:17:01,870
emitter of long wave so there's the

275
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:03,909
concept of emissivity and one of the

276
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,338
things that I think of when I'm thinking

277
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:10,000
about this is where for designing wood

278
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:12,009
stoves to heat the cabin somewhere we

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,278
would not want to build the wood stove

280
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:17,500
out of aluminum foil and be terrible it

281
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:19,328
had sit there and get hot and if you

282
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,068
walked into the room and tried to find

283
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:25,109
that wood stove you wouldn't tell where

284
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:27,730
it is but wood stoves are black and

285
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,500
they're effective emitters so as soon as

286
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:35,079
a wood stove it's hot it's giving off

287
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:37,750
its heat to the room so you would think

288
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:41,730
there's a lot of things in between here

289
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:44,558
between these two for emissivity and

290
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,169
there are but not as many as you might

291
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:50,950
think all polished metals have low

292
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:53,680
emissivity but most building materials

293
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:57,549
bricks white walls

294
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,380
stucco walls are all up in a higher

295
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:04,450
emissivity the only things that are

296
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:06,010
really low are shiny objects but they're

297
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,090
a nice example because they're really

298
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:11,400
low so why don't we just with G we you

299
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,579
just told us we can ignore

300
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,980
photosynthesis

301
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:18,449
why don't we round this off to one

302
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,940
significant digit and just call it one

303
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:25,930
yes we would if this was radiation

304
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:30,340
physics 101 but this is radiation

305
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:33,730
physics 501 and this number matters it's

306
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:36,699
multiplied by hundreds of watts per

307
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:41,610
meter squared so small changes in this

308
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:45,160
multiplier make a big difference for for

309
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:48,909
energy balance and it's worth putting

310
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:53,140
those numbers in by the way

311
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:58,240
snow is like this good emitter of long

312
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:00,100
wave and reflex short wave I've never

313
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,710
actually taught this with the live leaf

314
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:08,559
taped on the board before but in but it

315
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:11,980
helps drill de that concept so now that

316
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:16,599
we have this we can start to assemble

317
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:20,519
our energy balance model with all the

318
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:24,069
components of long wave radiation in

319
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:30,990
addition to shortwave because we just

320
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:30,990
ran our model and that

321
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,480
[Music]

322
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:45,980
we'll erase some of this and we will say

323
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:51,599
in red radiation shortwave , absorbed is

324
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:57,740
550 now we'd like to do radiation long

325
00:19:51,599 --> 00:20:00,359
wave incident first incident on the leaf

326
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,240
how much is coming in this vine is

327
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:06,389
incident on the leaf how much long wave

328
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,990
is coming in there's two sources of our

329
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:13,020
long wave particularly since our leaf is

330
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:17,058
a flat leaf above the ground a nice

331
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:21,058
simple example there's our flat leaf

332
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:29,940
right here and I'm gonna even take that

333
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:33,960
part off so we have ground shown in

334
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:38,970
black long wait coming up to the leaf

335
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:42,569
from the ground so let's say the ground

336
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,038
now I've the handout that assimilates

337
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:48,109
these in the giving them and it want to

338
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,109
follow the same numbers

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:02,529
we have to assume a ground temperature

340
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:10,449
measure it or assume it and in this case

341
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:15,190
I assumed 27 degrees C for the ground so

342
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:20,769
now we plug that number in and if I'm

343
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:26,769
lucky I can find my chart of long-wave

344
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:29,139
chart from yesterday where'd that go

345
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:33,730
anybody have that handy that's the table

346
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:38,430
of yeah you can you can look it up but I

347
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,430
want everybody to thanks follow along

348
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:59,308
here we go the grounds 27 460 but so 464

349
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:04,019
this part right here 460 P to the fourth

350
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:08,129
Kelvin but we have to soon measure or

351
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:13,620
assume an emissivity of the ground then

352
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:18,259
we're gonna take mmm I don't have a lot

353
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:22,378
of room but you can see it here times

354
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:31,589
0.9 for the emissivity of the ground so

355
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:33,178
that radiation going up is 414 these all

356
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:37,199
these units are in watts per meter

357
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:41,370
squared so that leaf is absorbing or is

358
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:45,990
getting 4 and 14 from the ground now

359
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:51,089
it's a horizontal leaf so it's also

360
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:53,308
getting radiation from the sky so you

361
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:55,048
would think the sky temperature on the

362
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:59,278
warm day Mike the air temperature might

363
00:22:55,048 --> 00:23:01,710
be 27 degrees C and you would think well

364
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:05,250
if not the same as the ground then if

365
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:13,079
the air molecules are 27 we could do the

366
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:15,058
same thing and be 414 here correct the

367
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:21,319
question is there is how much long wave

368
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:25,648
is from the Sun and the if the answer is

369
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:29,119
no if you take a Radiometer good

370
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:31,859
radiometer and point it right at the Sun

371
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:36,479
you get the same temperature is that

372
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:38,668
open sky yeah none it's just amazing and

373
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,079
you know it's so counterintuitive you

374
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,120
almost have to walk out with the

375
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,038
instrument so that's baloney I don't

376
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,528
believe that and they pointed at the Sun

377
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,960
so after class take an instrument and go

378
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:51,329
through that test and convince yourself

379
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,450
it's just it's just amazing all that Sun

380
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,970
is shortwave so but that's the shortwave

381
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,690
is

382
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:03,069
. in the sky and the whole rest of the

383
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:07,330
sky is emitting but even though the air

384
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:10,178
molecules might be 27 degree c radiation

385
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:13,480
the atmosphere is pretty transparent to

386
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:18,548
long-wave and if it was perfectly

387
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:25,089
transparent like say on the moon it

388
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:29,230
would be zero outer space is zero kelvin

389
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:32,168
that'd be zero but we don't get zero we

390
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:35,919
make careful measurements of this and we

391
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:40,120
get cold sky temperatures somewhere in

392
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:45,090
between room temperature and zero and we

393
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:48,609
call that the effective sky temperature

394
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:51,730
and it it depends somewhat on elevation

395
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:56,678
so it's colder skies and high elevation

396
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:58,839
because there's less air it depends on

397
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,570
relative humidity a bit because the

398
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:06,129
water vapor molecules affect it but

399
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:11,288
typically from a sky we'll get three

400
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:18,640
hundred watts per meter squared now

401
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:21,220
that's a clear sky so did we use this to

402
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,909
get the clear sky whale what's the

403
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:28,409
effect of emissivity of the air what's

404
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:31,480
the effect of temperature both of these

405
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:34,000
interact to give us this number so this

406
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,909
is generally a measured number it

407
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,200
doesn't depend on air temperature it

408
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:46,419
just depends on how clear the sky is

409
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:52,600
clouds let's take a case with clouds I'm

410
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:55,249
going to get rid of this zero clear sky

411
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,618
which is what we're doing this model for

412
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:59,890
right now and clear sky now we go over

413
00:25:57,618 --> 00:26:02,639
here

414
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:05,970
[Music]

415
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,220
clouds and it doesn't have to be a black

416
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,319
thundercloud it can be a perfectly white

417
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,390
nice cloud in the sky

418
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,169
now we go out with our instruments and

419
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:18,900
pointed at the cloud

420
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:23,250
clouds are relatively close to the earth

421
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,620
they're full of water vapor so now we

422
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,319
are in fact reading the temperature of

423
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:34,829
the water vapor molecules in the cloud

424
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:38,909
and pretty often a cloud can it will

425
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:43,259
jump up to oh maybe four hundred watts

426
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,759
per meter squared because it's close to

427
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:48,500
the ground and the molecules in the

428
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:52,379
cloud are warm and we no longer see the

429
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,740
infinity of space so and if it's a real

430
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,620
heavy cloud this can get all the way up

431
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,960
to over 400 for a cloudy so there's a

432
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:07,789
big difference between cloudy skies and

433
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:10,500
sunny skies for long wave radiation so

434
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:12,629
everything else we do from the

435
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,269
emissivity of the surface and the

436
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,610
temperature but clouds and sky

437
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:21,170
temperature we just measure them now

438
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:26,789
2-pin measured many times and so we we

439
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:29,970
know approximately what they are so

440
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:32,639
let's start adding up these numbers now

441
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:38,720
for radiation and we get 550 absorbed

442
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:48,180
now this is oh let's see

443
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:51,900
414 plus 300 would be 714 watts per

444
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:57,870
meter squared radiation but there's one

445
00:27:51,900 --> 00:28:03,030
other calculation 0.96 is the emissivity

446
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:07,379
of a surface but this is an important

447
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:12,950
thing I'm I'm going to put it right here

448
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,950
emissivity equals absorptivity

449
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:27,599
RP e equals 8 this means that if a

450
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:31,710
surface is 0.96 for emitting radiation

451
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,990
it's also 0.96 for absorbing that same

452
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:44,240
radiation

453
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:49,950
so if 714 is coming in let's put this

454
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:54,180
right over here 714 in we have to

455
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:58,080
multiply that by 0.96 for the leaf for

456
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:06,900
the absorptivity of the leaf and that

457
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:11,879
comes out to 685 and that number is the

458
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:18,210
energy absorbed by the leaf in long-wave

459
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:24,260
this is radiation long-wave absorbed it

460
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:35,360
in this example with now we som that 685

461
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:35,359
with 550 here our long-wave absorbed 685

462
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:44,850
so the staggering message is wow there

463
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,880
is more long-wave absorbed by that leaf

464
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:51,000
than shortwave the Sun is hot you go

465
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,580
outside and you think wow this is it how

466
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,430
can this be this is hot now what's the

467
00:29:53,579 --> 00:30:05,189
sum twelve thank you

468
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:07,799
twelve thirty five so maybe in radiation

469
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,779
101 you would say wow they have to

470
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:14,730
evaporate enough water to get rid of

471
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:18,059
this energy but long wave works both

472
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:21,779
ways all this long wave is coming into

473
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:22,049
this leaf from the ground but wait a

474
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,720
minute

475
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:30,829
what's the leaf temperature and I

476
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,829
assumed a leaf temperature of 25 °c

477
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:43,009
now how much is leaving that leaf by

478
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:48,960
long-wave and we look up on our chart 25

479
00:30:43,009 --> 00:31:01,160
448 I'm gonna let's see I'm gonna put

480
00:30:48,960 --> 00:31:03,329
this over here here's a leaf 25 for 48

481
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:08,509
times 0.96

482
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:12,769
right so that's a little less than that

483
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:12,769
for 30 for 30

484
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,900
so you say well good we can subtract for

485
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,899
30 from this and the leaf doesn't have

486
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,679
to evaporate so much water but it gets

487
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:30,660
even better than this radiation doesn't

488
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:34,230
just go down radiation can go up to from

489
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:41,058
the leaf both up and down so the

490
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:41,058
downside is 4:30 and the up is also 4:30

491
00:31:43,670 --> 00:32:03,300
so radiation long wave emitted is 860

492
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:06,470
watts per meter squared so then erase

493
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,470
some older stuff here

494
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:21,399
so we start to do a sum of this and we

495
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:23,190
have radiation absorbed total radiation

496
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:40,660
absorbed

497
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:47,100
12:35 radiation emitted 860 so and this

498
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:52,690
is out so we subtract it 300 Thank You

499
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:56,980
375 watts per meter squared and that's

500
00:32:52,690 --> 00:33:00,490
the final answer no other add-ons this

501
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:05,890
is how much water that leaf has to

502
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:08,349
evaporate to stay at air temperature so

503
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:11,530
big numbers coming in because this is

504
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:15,459
shortwave and long wave but big numbers

505
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:19,629
going out too and if you think about

506
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,549
this this energy balance right here

507
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,040
between the leaf and the ground if

508
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:26,559
ground and the leaf might be close to

509
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:29,369
the same temperature so this is always

510
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,399
fairly tiny the net between the ground

511
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:37,149
but the sky is colder than the ground if

512
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,790
it's clear so we can lose energy by

513
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,400
long-lived radiation to the sky and that

514
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:44,500
helps on a clear day it helps keep leave

515
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:51,550
school because they're emitting to the

516
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:56,650
clear sky so these are the components

517
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:59,799
and what we calculated was but we didn't

518
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,250
explicitly do net long wave but we could

519
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:06,460
have

520
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:10,630
here's 685 N and 860 out for long wave

521
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:12,730
and so the net long wave is a negative

522
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,280
number and it is always a negative

523
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:17,980
number if the sky is clear we're losing

524
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:24,419
more long wave we're losing heat by long

525
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:31,168
wave so having worked through this

526
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:38,819
step-by-step using the same inputs as

527
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:41,619
this here's a worked out example and

528
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:44,380
thankfully with your help getting done

529
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:47,648
the math we got the same number as the

530
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,869
worked out example so it means either we

531
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:53,980
had corresponding errors or everything's

532
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:56,589
correct but this is these are the inputs

533
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,920
and outputs that you always use to

534
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:03,370
determine radiation balance for a any

535
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,880
object leaf and these numbers are all

536
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:09,119
big the stuff coming in and going out is

537
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,119
big

538
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,360
you would think maybe we would like to

539
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,360
have leaves kind of like tinfoil why

540
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,950
didn't they evolve like this well they

541
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,900
can't get rid of their once they get hot

542
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:26,029
they can't get rid of the heat that

543
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,400
would not be so good because they're

544
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:32,600
shiny it's better to have leaves

545
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,760
something like this and there they're

546
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,299
not absorbing the heat in the first

547
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,770
place

548
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:49,250
and then they're emitting long wave to

549
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:51,349
stay cool so there's a I'm thinking

550
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,760
about this and teaching it over the

551
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,849
years and I'm thinking about how do you

552
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:02,980
give examples to drive home the power of

553
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:05,630
long wave radiation and i'ma give you

554
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:10,519
I'm gonna let's see I'm gonna take these

555
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:16,430
down to there's more room up here what

556
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:19,670
if well here's that this is a well-known

557
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:22,219
thing from Boy Scouts if it's a cold

558
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:26,720
clear night in the mountains go sleep

559
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:30,169
under a tree you'll be warmer and the

560
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,369
Boy Scouts are coming you know but if

561
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,680
you went out there and did the net

562
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,539
radiation the tree is way warmer than

563
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,489
sleeping outside under the clear sky

564
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:43,550
because of the radiation I don't have

565
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:48,589
one with me bred it but I did it would

566
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:50,380
be a great example a space blanket you

567
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:53,210
know how can they nope yeah there's spin

568
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:57,460
while they help you ee because they're

569
00:36:53,210 --> 00:37:02,750
shiny on both sides so your body heat

570
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:05,480
gets reflected back in and this does not

571
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,820
emit to the outside that's why space

572
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,349
blankets are so effective it's nothing

573
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,980
to do with conduction and convection

574
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:16,460
it's all radiation physics keeping the

575
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,010
warm temperature in people say yeah yeah

576
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,710
you know my grandmother always says put

577
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,420
the dull side out and potatoes in the

578
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:26,449
oven you can read on

579
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,280
we'll argue about that stuff online it

580
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:30,259
turns out it just doesn't matter the

581
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,019
dull side is really close to the outside

582
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:37,760
and you know they're they're both low

583
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:39,769
emissivity sides so if this is the case

584
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,660
why do you wrap potatoes in aluminum

585
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:43,460
foil because geez

586
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:45,529
I mean the radiation from the oven is

587
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:50,510
not contributing to heating up the

588
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:52,880
potato to keep the moisture in for the

589
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:55,520
potatoes this is very effective to keep

590
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,798
the moisture in even though it makes the

591
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:02,150
potatoes cook more slowly but that's all

592
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:03,769
radiation physics in the kitchen and it

593
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,720
can go on and on about all the cool

594
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:08,059
examples in a kitchen of cooking food

595
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:10,308
and radiation physics how fast is my

596
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:11,900
food going to cook in an oven what's the

597
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:15,220
walls of the temperature of the oven

598
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,230
there's no shortwave in an oven it's all

599
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:20,808
radiation physics and it's helped now

600
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:24,858
with convection ovens return a fan on so

601
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:28,940
we get some convection in there but

602
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:31,190
here's an example that drives home the

603
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,889
power of long wave radiation and I'll

604
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,780
draw a diagram of this and then you can

605
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:40,179
tell me what you think is going to

606
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,180
happen we're gonna build

607
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:50,670
a box or a cylinder and we'll make it

608
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:56,699
out of styrofoam something that's a very

609
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:59,510
effective insulator and yeah a couple

610
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:08,809
feet tall and in the bottom of this

611
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:08,810
we're gonna put a bowl with water in it

612
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:15,539
thin layer of water and by the way the

613
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:18,419
bowls painted flat black it's a surface

614
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:23,489
of the bowls playing flat black water in

615
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:27,809
it now we take this outside it's a

616
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:32,789
simple device take this outside like

617
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:35,279
tonight it's hot and but if my the

618
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:38,099
temperature might get down to 28 25 see

619
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:43,050
tonight we take it outside under a clear

620
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:47,119
sky and it's calm winds what's going to

621
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,120
happen to the temperature that water

622
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,960
the room temperature when brought it

623
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,960
outside

624
00:39:55,588 --> 00:40:05,400
it's going to radiate to the infinity of

625
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:07,559
space and the whole inside of this is

626
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,249
going to radiate to the infinity of

627
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:15,298
space and it will get colder and colder

628
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:18,659
and conduction and convection can't

629
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:23,478
can't warm it back up because we have a

630
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:27,808
big insulated cylinder and if it's windy

631
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:30,899
we could put a piece of cellophane on

632
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:34,769
there real thin cellophane transmits

633
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:38,249
long wave but if it works good even

634
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:42,478
without this so now it gets colder and

635
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:46,768
colder and it's radiations coming in

636
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:51,568
from the sky right but it's a clear

637
00:40:46,768 --> 00:40:57,419
night and the sky temperature

638
00:40:51,568 --> 00:41:00,509
I put 300 as an average but around here

639
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:06,568
and I've got some examples of this this

640
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:10,708
sky temperature can be more like mmm I

641
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:14,278
don't know if I've seen 200 but 250

642
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:21,748
watts per meter squared mark do membered

643
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:27,778
low numbers from sky there it's so let's

644
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:29,909
let's say 250 for summer now radiation

645
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:33,599
entered we have to follow the thirst

646
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:36,028
first law of thermodynamics so energy in

647
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,599
equals energy out so this keeps going

648
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:47,989
until these two arrows are exactly the

649
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:51,689
same size and if 250 is coming in 250

650
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:54,719
has to be going out what's the

651
00:41:51,688 --> 00:42:01,159
temperature of the water on a hot summer

652
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:03,700
night and Logan if 250 is the emitted

653
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:13,509
radiation

654
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:19,449
ooh I got put mine back to our table the

655
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:22,450
water freezes it easily freezes and this

656
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:25,838
is so counterintuitive it would freeze

657
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:28,029
even if the sky was three hundred it had

658
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:31,539
get below zero and the water would

659
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:37,769
freeze that is the power of long wave

660
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:42,659
radiation so this is so cool after I

661
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:47,380
thought of this I had to go do it and

662
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:50,759
this is my house my backyard patio we'll

663
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:55,030
Gazoo min on this we can get this really

664
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,700
big in here and I got some blue

665
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,040
styrofoam I did it once and it didn't

666
00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:02,439
get super cold and I kept doing it and I

667
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:05,019
got bigger layers and I made this longer

668
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,179
you can see a fine net radiometer right

669
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:10,269
up here so I can see how this is coming

670
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:12,190
along and you can tell this is a long

671
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:14,530
time ago because this is like an old

672
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:19,389
8088 computer and this is my daughter

673
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:21,490
who is now 26 years old and little pump

674
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:24,129
to inflate the domes and that thing and

675
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:26,858
right in here is a Campbell scientific

676
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:29,410
data logger with thermocouples in the

677
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:31,779
water and thermocouples all over and I'm

678
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:34,420
watching a very primitive graph of the

679
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,460
temperature in this thing and my wife

680
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,710
came out and took a picture and it

681
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,139
wasn't dark yet it was you know the Sun

682
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,000
was just setting I never got that water

683
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:46,808
to freeze but I got it to like one

684
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,750
degree see it was pretty cold that's

685
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:51,670
that's radiation physics and in fact

686
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,349
this is such a powerful principle the

687
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,559
reason I thought of it is because people

688
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:58,480
make refrigerators in the tropics just

689
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,670
like this and they open them at night

690
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,039
and they have blocks of water in here

691
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,298
and if they get cool in the day and

692
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,630
they're cool at night and then they

693
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:11,639
close them in the day and you can keep

694
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:14,260
food cold just by radiational cooling in

695
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:15,818
fact you could run this in the days if

696
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,030
you kept pointing it away from the

697
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:21,820
sunlight because the

698
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,820
sky is clear in the night and the day I

699
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:31,090
have a couple of other examples of this

700
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:39,290
and since this particular audience is

701
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:43,969
instrument intensive now we'll show some

702
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:46,300
actual data and I guess oome out just a

703
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:49,549
bit there we go

704
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,400
this is some data I gave this is a test

705
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:53,920
question to students after I talked

706
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,680
about this principles

707
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,800
this is last winter January 1 11 January

708
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:05,089
11th it's one week to January 17th this

709
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,550
is on campus net radiation and first of

710
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,940
all its measured albedo because we have

711
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:13,789
radiation and radiation out so what you

712
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,130
need to know here is on these days the

713
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:19,759
snow had melted off and it was basically

714
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:22,338
grass mostly dead grasses January but it

715
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,190
wasn't snow so what did we say the

716
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:28,279
albedo of grass was maybe 0.25

717
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:33,500
hard to see on this scale but there's

718
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,570
about 0.25 for these days here then we

719
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:41,000
had these are night by the way in here

720
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:44,470
that's just zero zero and zero out then

721
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,030
we had this big spike that went to two

722
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:50,209
and if you weren't an instrumentation

723
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:53,410
person you're going to go Wow two times

724
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:56,588
as much shortwave radiation leaving as

725
00:45:53,409 --> 00:45:56,588
coming in

726
00:45:57,548 --> 00:46:05,219
so what could have caused that this this

727
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:09,578
giant spike right here now if you're

728
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:13,358
living in the area you would remember

729
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:18,699
what the weather was like but here is

730
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:23,228
why that thing spiked up this is peter

731
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:25,539
sinks at the same time and there's a

732
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:28,448
bunch of snow this is a Huck's a flux

733
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:30,039
net radiometer shortwave in long-wave

734
00:46:28,449 --> 00:46:31,749
out guess what the shortwave in it's

735
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:34,449
blocked so of course it goes to two

736
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:39,338
because is it that bottom one is not

737
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:41,108
blocked so we get issues like this and

738
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:43,208
you just have to understand the things

739
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:45,578
that may give you a bad data and filter

740
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:47,498
them out of the data set so but that the

741
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:49,298
can I wish if eyes a little more

742
00:46:47,498 --> 00:46:51,518
organized I'd show you the exact picture

743
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:53,318
of the campus station at the same time

744
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:55,658
because it happens every time it snow so

745
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:58,599
you get stuff in here for that reason we

746
00:46:55,659 --> 00:47:01,838
put heaters in sensors whenever we can

747
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,639
two heaters are expensive so it's hard

748
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,739
to run them off a solar power and then

749
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:09,099
when it snows you get snow in your solar

750
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:13,298
panel and stuff but here is it one

751
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:15,969
little silicon pyrometer with the heater

752
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:18,309
that kept reading correctly during that

753
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:22,838
snowstorm so if we would have had two of

754
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:26,109
these in that system we would not have

755
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:31,298
had this artifact right here this L

756
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:33,759
Beatle of two but okay right here the

757
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:35,978
snow melted and it's a little not

758
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:41,528
completely melted now look at the albedo

759
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:45,188
of this surface no snow snows ha point

760
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:47,588
eight so the snow we did what it showed

761
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:49,808
this reflected shortwave radiation and

762
00:47:47,588 --> 00:47:52,748
then we got some I think we got more

763
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:55,509
snow and but it but it better jump from

764
00:47:52,748 --> 00:48:00,328
is a nice example of no snow and snow on

765
00:47:55,509 --> 00:48:05,409
the ground here's some numbers for

766
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:07,329
incoming long wave so so mark said we

767
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:10,990
can get down to 200 in the winter well

768
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:13,660
there we go that was a very clear sky

769
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:17,529
the long-wave was 200 watts per meter

770
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:22,029
squared here's a cloudy sky and we're up

771
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:26,320
around 320 and when it gets whenever it

772
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:28,210
gets clear this guy gets cold outgoing

773
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,680
long-wave is just based on the

774
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,349
temperature of the ground and that's

775
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,730
this Purple Line and you can tell the

776
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:38,050
temperature of the ground because the

777
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:40,539
outgoing long-wave was 280 to 300 which

778
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:43,720
is right just slightly below zero the

779
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:48,789
surface of the snow up there was was

780
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:53,949
probably -3 degrees so this these graphs

781
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:59,588
are on the internet and I'm going to put

782
00:48:53,949 --> 00:49:01,329
the location right here because as soon

783
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:03,699
as you know the principles you can watch

784
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:11,880
these graphs and say yeah that's why

785
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:16,739
this is working there at weather dot USU

786
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:19,510
dot e-d-u this is a whole series of

787
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:21,759
graphs of all these principles there's

788
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:25,180
many more but this is one of them

789
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,500
and I use these all the time as test

790
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:28,210
questions they say hey was the weather

791
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,219
last week here's what was going on

792
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,500
explain this graph why did this go up

793
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:34,329
why did this go down and you've got to

794
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,550
look at ratios of different graphs to

795
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:38,619
see what's going on but it's really

796
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:41,589
helpful that drive these this all this

797
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:44,789
radiation physics into your head to see

798
00:49:41,588 --> 00:49:47,900
examples of it

799
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:47,900
[Music]

800
00:49:54,349 --> 00:50:01,009
yeah this is the same same time period

801
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:06,078
it's a different graph but ground

802
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:08,809
temperature equivalent sky temperature

803
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:11,239
that's what we call it the sky

804
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:16,819
temperature up here is if the equivalent

805
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:19,699
of minus 22 C it's the combination of

806
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:21,108
effective emissivity in sky temperature

807
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:23,858
and we call that equivalent sky

808
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:26,449
temperature and then net is just the

809
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:28,130
difference and of course whenever the

810
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:33,639
net is a really low number that means

811
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:37,430
it's a clear sky and look at this zero

812
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:41,239
cloudy skies lots of clouds in this

813
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:43,190
period the net radiation was zero the

814
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:46,519
clouds were just as warm as the cold

815
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:50,289
surface and in the winter there in the

816
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:50,288
in in the heavy clouds

817
00:50:53,199 --> 00:51:04,358
now let me here I don't have a handout

818
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:09,559
of this but I'm always looking for

819
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:15,619
teaching examples here is can move this

820
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:18,940
up a little a picture here to be to be

821
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:22,550
right I'm gonna I put that part off

822
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,289
there's a picture of the stone it's a

823
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:27,380
little bit Glary but this is all snow

824
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:29,059
this is in the middle of winter I'm not

825
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:32,180
this I'd like to tell you this was up

826
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:35,840
Logan Canyon but it wasn't a dark rock

827
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:38,509
and look at the melting of the snow

828
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,000
here's the shadow of the rock it's a

829
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:44,960
bright day here's the melting of the

830
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:52,179
snow now right around the rock what made

831
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:54,710
that snow melt reflected shortwave oh

832
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:58,480
wait a minute the rock is really dark

833
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:02,300
there's hardly any reflected shortwave

834
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:05,780
every day that rock absorbed the

835
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:10,550
shortwave like crazy and got warm above

836
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:13,010
the air temperature and all night long

837
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:16,100
is emitting long wave radiation and

838
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:18,619
melting the snow so this is long wave

839
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:22,750
radiation melting the snow from a warm

840
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:26,059
Rock not reflected shortwave radiation

841
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:29,000
that's what then I put that down here

842
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:32,179
long wave radiation emitted from a stone

843
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,369
and you can see it's it's not super warm

844
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:36,319
it's probably melting this a few

845
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:39,079
millimeters every day until it snows

846
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:45,260
again but it's warm enough to melt the

847
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:49,719
snow by the long-wave because net

848
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:52,940
radiation is such a big factor in

849
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:58,629
everything with energy balance and and

850
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:01,789
and because by the way now we have

851
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:03,079
simplified all this stuff feeds it into

852
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:10,119
one thing

853
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:15,079
and we'll put it up here it's just good

854
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:20,029
now our whole equation goes to our net

855
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:23,989
and this is absorbed equals T plus C

856
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:28,130
squared all those components that feed

857
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:34,429
into this give us one number and sort of

858
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:38,570
put numbers on this 375 equals T plus

859
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:41,210
the sum of T plus C squared so once this

860
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:43,400
is a tough number to get at because of

861
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:45,380
all the factors we talked about but once

862
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,460
we get it wow there's only two

863
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:56,680
components that can go into this so this

864
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:59,960
is the theory but not surprisingly

865
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:02,629
companies have built instruments to

866
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:09,679
measure this number to make this easy

867
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:13,670
and to help people understand those

868
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:16,389
instruments we made another refrigerator

869
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:21,470
maintenance and you can put it on your

870
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:24,559
filing cabinet and look at it and every

871
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:30,319
time things seem a little goofy and this

872
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:34,369
has got two sides I think this is I can

873
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:36,980
zoom in a hair two sides summer and

874
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:39,500
winter and it's great because these

875
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,969
fluxes are so different and it's got

876
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,349
shortwave and long ways all these

877
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:45,250
principles we've been talked about for

878
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:48,589
two days are all right here thousand in

879
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:51,860
now two hundred out so the albedo is

880
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:57,110
point two in this example nice round

881
00:54:51,860 --> 00:55:01,010
number the net for this is 800 because

882
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:04,849
sums reflected here's long wave for 50

883
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:07,640
so this is roughly what would 450 be 24

884
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:16,069
C or something right around there sky

885
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:17,028
300 net minus 150 so net and net 650

886
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:22,929
watts per meters

887
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:27,639
weird for a fully vegetated surface so

888
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:31,189
in this case this is not a single leaf

889
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:33,798
we do not have transmitted radiation to

890
00:55:31,188 --> 00:55:37,068
the ground because it's fully all those

891
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:39,949
leaf layers are all absorbing it we also

892
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:44,058
don't have two sides to radiate

893
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:45,559
radiation here it was radiating down but

894
00:55:44,059 --> 00:55:49,429
here the ground and the leaves are the

895
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:53,229
same so we gotta get rid of 450 watts

896
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:57,338
per meter squared in the summer winter

897
00:55:53,228 --> 00:56:00,468
much lower input you can see the Sun

898
00:55:57,338 --> 00:56:05,058
anatomically-correct Sun sank in the sky

899
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:07,699
a little bit 400 in snow 350 out now the

900
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:10,939
Nets only 50 in the winter no wonder

901
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:13,818
it's cold in the winter long wave the

902
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:17,268
snow is cold so only 300 and a little

903
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:22,668
bit less long way from the sky net 50

904
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:27,798
our net plus 50 net minus 50 zero so

905
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:31,308
it's not warming up on days like this in

906
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:34,969
the winter largely because of the snow

907
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:36,949
cover then we finally get some warm air

908
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:39,708
to help melt the snow and then the hole

909
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:41,959
warming starts but this little

910
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:44,478
refrigerator magnet helps to understand

911
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:47,208
the magnitudes of the fluxes in in two

912
00:56:44,478 --> 00:56:49,748
very different conditions so it's been

913
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:49,748
helpful

914
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:58,780
I'm gonna stop here and pick this up

915
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,829
tomorrow

916
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:06,110
when I think at this point the next

917
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:09,259
thing I want to do is apply this to the

918
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:15,980
whole planet Earth for energy balance on

919
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:19,520
the earth because we're an independent

920
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:22,070
or system orbiting through the vacuum of

921
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,259
space we are not losing heat by

922
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:26,750
conduction and convection the earth

923
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:29,300
isn't we're not losing or gaining heat

924
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:32,210
by transpiration the water we have stays

925
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:36,920
in the earth all we have is radiation

926
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:43,190
physics to the rest of the rest of the

927
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:45,800
universe so if that doesn't balance if

928
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:49,130
if this whole thing if our if net

929
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,920
radiation is a zero point zero zero for

930
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:55,369
the earth we're either going to cool off

931
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,200
or warm up so now that you have these

932
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:58,849
principles in place and how we can take

933
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,039
and look at the fluxes for the whole

934
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:03,529
earth and this in a nutshell is the

935
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:07,849
essence of global warming and I think I

936
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:09,920
can explain to you why that's complex

937
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:12,289
we're the smartest people in the world

938
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,950
are doing gold forming right now to try

939
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:18,230
and see is this number really zero you

940
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:22,129
know and how how far off of zero is it

941
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:44,210
and that's all radiation physics so I'll

942
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:48,460
stop here no that's not noise that's the

943
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:51,230
subject of many PhD theses it is and

944
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:53,630
yeah well you got to start with one

945
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:55,699
thing that we understand really well and

946
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:57,740
then you say okay here's that leaf now

947
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:02,210
we're going to tilt it and now what

948
00:58:57,739 --> 00:59:05,719
happens so the first thing that happens

949
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:09,110
is multiple tilted leaves don't reflect

950
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:11,209
quite as much and and as we just said

951
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:14,840
here they the transmission of the ground

952
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:18,039
is much less but it doesn't affect it as

953
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:22,160
much as you might think because you

954
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:25,219
still have reflected shortwave and the

955
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,109
long wave is just from the surfaces it

956
00:59:25,219 --> 00:59:28,730
doesn't matter that they're all vertical

957
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:34,870
surfaces and it's going like this

958
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:38,090
eventually it goes up so one flat leaf

959
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:40,279
has the same effective radiation as a

960
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:42,430
hundred vertical leaves as long as

961
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,830
they're covering the ground

962
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:49,099
that orientation doesn't matter for the

963
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:51,829
emission of long-wave same thing for

964
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:54,860
absorption it comes in the biggest thing

965
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:58,299
with tilting leaves is reflections of

966
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:01,370
shortwave where we're at bounces and

967
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:03,440
captures that better like it's any rough

968
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:06,139
surface would absorb better than a

969
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,380
smooth polished surface in fact that's

970
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:12,619
part of the reason that polished metal

971
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:15,710
is so such a low emissivity when

972
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:18,949
polished metal oxidizes my copper it

973
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:21,710
goes green all of a sudden polish copper

974
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:24,679
is 0.03 it oxidizes and goes green and

975
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:27,079
now it's 0.9 because that surface is

976
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:30,139
rough and it's so it's a similar thing

977
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:31,849
to leaves that it's the structure of the

978
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:34,299
surface affects the reflection of

979
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:34,299
shortwave

980
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,930
just part of it also

981
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:59,838
with with vertical leaves it yeah okay

982
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:03,950
let me add to this answered let me add

983
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:05,838
to this answer we said a thousand watts

984
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:08,539
per meter squared for this I actually

985
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,099
had never thought of this before that

986
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:13,460
only happens the fifth leaf is

987
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:15,320
perpendicular to the Sun and the Sun is

988
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:18,530
only perpendicular to the ground at the

989
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:21,890
equator at the right time of the year so

990
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:24,080
I probably should do this example with a

991
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:26,719
flat leaf in an angle because it

992
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,909
wouldn't be a thousand it'd be flattened

993
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:32,059
if it was really close to the Sun it'd

994
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:35,259
be a lot less so yes that angle

995
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:38,829
definitely matters being mean

996
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,830
perpendicular to the light source

997
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:51,950
thank you that's correct we yeah that's

998
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:55,399
right it and and this brings us to an

999
01:01:51,949 --> 01:02:01,789
instrumentation tidbit that is not well

1000
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:04,119
understood by people let me go right

1001
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:04,119
here

1002
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:15,279
when we build or use instruments here's

1003
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:17,440
an instrument and here's up some white

1004
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,589
discs up here I mean they're various

1005
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:24,338
shapes of curved domes but we say these

1006
01:02:20,588 --> 01:02:26,799
are cosine corrected and everybody says

1007
01:02:24,338 --> 01:02:31,328
okay cosine corrected that's good what

1008
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:34,359
does that mean it means that if you put

1009
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:37,059
a reference light here you would get

1010
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:40,239
let's say we did this and we got a

1011
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:43,690
thousand watts per meter squared now we

1012
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:46,989
took that same light and we put it at

1013
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:49,059
some low angle if this sensor still

1014
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:53,709
reads a thousand it's not cosine

1015
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:57,760
corrected it has to read less by the

1016
01:02:53,710 --> 01:03:00,760
cosine of this angle so at a low angle

1017
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:04,089
the correct number might be say a

1018
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:07,270
hundred the correct number now if it

1019
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:10,328
reads 200 it's not cosine corrected if

1020
01:03:07,269 --> 01:03:16,230
it reads 50 it's also not cosine

1021
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:20,109
corrected has to be the right ratio of

1022
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:23,588
tilted radiation so if we make a graph

1023
01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:29,920
of this there's one of these graphs on

1024
01:03:23,588 --> 01:03:37,529
the apogee website have to think this

1025
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:37,530
goes like this and I think this graph is

1026
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:51,469
let me see nope this is this is

1027
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:56,659
radiation here and this is angle so

1028
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:58,189
right here is 90 degrees and that sensor

1029
01:03:56,659 --> 01:04:01,389
should read zero because everything's

1030
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:04,760
missing it and here's zero degrees and

1031
01:04:01,389 --> 01:04:07,460
and this might be a hundred or a

1032
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,240
thousand depending on the units so this

1033
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:14,679
is a theoretically perfect cosine

1034
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:16,969
response that says at each lower angle

1035
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:20,809
that reading of the instrument should

1036
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:26,589
reach somewhat less and I used to think

1037
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:29,239
many years ago that all the instruments

1038
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:31,130
went like that and they were wrong

1039
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:33,439
because they didn't capture the low

1040
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:35,300
angle right and now we know it's this is

1041
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,849
easy to make a sensor that goes like

1042
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,530
that it's you can get too much low angle

1043
01:04:37,849 --> 01:04:42,529
light you can undo it

1044
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:45,260
or overdo it and any instrument has to

1045
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:49,580
have the right optics to follow this

1046
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:52,790
line as closely as possible that the

1047
01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:55,789
theoretically perfect cosine not too low

1048
01:04:52,789 --> 01:05:00,469
not too high we calibrate our

1049
01:04:55,789 --> 01:05:03,079
instruments right here and then we hope

1050
01:05:00,469 --> 01:05:04,549
all those angles are correct and once

1051
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:13,179
you get it right for an instrument it's

1052
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:17,030
it's reproducible this in the summer

1053
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:20,239
most of the sunlight is in this range

1054
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:23,180
here it's in high angles and it's not

1055
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:27,729
too hard to get an instrument to follow

1056
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:30,829
this at these angles it gets really hard

1057
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:34,460
to get the instrument to keep following

1058
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:37,400
it right to zero and in fact none of our

1059
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:39,289
instruments get this perfect the highest

1060
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:42,170
end Kippen zone and instruments aren't

1061
01:05:39,289 --> 01:05:45,860
perfect none of them are but they get

1062
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:49,309
close they they start to deviate right

1063
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:51,349
down here from perfect and this isn't

1064
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:53,690
too critical because this is low angle

1065
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:54,349
light it's there just in you might be

1066
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:57,170
off by

1067
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:59,630
five percent but it's five percent of a

1068
01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:02,720
small number and over here you better be

1069
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:05,720
right on because it's it's a big number

1070
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:07,869
so this is this is cosine correction and

1071
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:10,309
I think this speaks to your example of

1072
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:15,170
angles in here and what happens when you

1073
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:18,320
tilt things what what how does it change

1074
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:20,840
it but our instruments measure it's by

1075
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:25,370
definition what would the radiation be

1076
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:27,110
on a flat surface and if you want to

1077
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:28,880
calculate the radiation on a tilted

1078
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:31,849
source you can you little trigonometry

1079
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,170
in like like Mark just pointed out and

1080
01:06:31,849 --> 01:06:39,980
if you tilt that it goes above the

1081
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:42,740
thousand but it's that's that's one way

1082
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:45,559
to explain the effect of tilted surfaces

1083
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:47,809
and this is for an instrument but you

1084
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:50,119
can also use this for any surface but

1085
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:53,389
what would it be tilted toward the Sun

1086
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:56,839
if you made your measurement flat you

1087
01:06:53,389 --> 01:07:00,519
could predict them the increase in

1088
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,519
radiation from tilting it

1089
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:23,439
that's a good question yes yes there yes

1090
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:27,489
really good question and the answer is

1091
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:30,818
yes and now let me answer that question

1092
01:07:27,489 --> 01:07:41,049
I got a race and give myself a tiny bit

1093
01:07:30,818 --> 01:07:43,750
more room in a beef in particular here's

1094
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:49,060
our leaf now we're going to bring in a

1095
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:54,039
way giant microscope and leaves are half

1096
01:07:49,059 --> 01:08:02,099
air and this marker green marker yeah

1097
01:07:54,039 --> 01:08:04,838
it's good enough you get this is some

1098
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:08,460
beginning plant physiology and then you

1099
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:11,710
get stole mates in here like this and

1100
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:14,889
every plant biology book has a diagram

1101
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:16,810
like this there's full air and these

1102
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:18,639
aren't as probably as quite as dense as

1103
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:21,880
I drew them they're not they're not

1104
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,730
touching now we have light coming right

1105
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:27,460
through and it bounces around and it

1106
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:30,639
bounces out and now we have light coming

1107
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:33,039
at an angle and it bounces a lot more

1108
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,100
and the transmission of light coming at

1109
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:39,039
and angles way less the reflection is

1110
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:43,180
more because it's a low angle but the

1111
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:45,850
transmission is less so we study

1112
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:49,539
penetration of light into leaves at

1113
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:51,460
different angles and it the lower the

1114
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:53,500
light the less the transmission so one

1115
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:57,880
part of this goes down and another part

1116
01:08:53,500 --> 01:09:01,000
goes up which is partly why we get away

1117
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:04,420
with saying point five because it's

1118
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:08,588
there's some offsetting changes than

1119
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:11,319
this but in general the transmission at

1120
01:09:08,588 --> 01:09:13,488
low angles goes down faster than this

1121
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:17,779
goes up

1122
01:09:13,488 --> 01:09:20,028
in fact when we get to hole canopies you

1123
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:22,069
can imagine how much math you can do to

1124
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:25,160
try and analyze this with all the angles

1125
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:26,719
and people have worked on that but

1126
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:28,488
another way is just to put a net

1127
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:32,289
radiometer out there and just measure it

1128
01:09:28,488 --> 01:09:35,718
and say the sum of all these is this and

1129
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:37,850
that's there's a theoretical treatment

1130
01:09:35,719 --> 01:09:40,039
and then there's the measurements and if

1131
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:44,329
your instruments good you're going to

1132
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:46,579
nail these these fluxes on this this is

1133
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:51,109
a great example of why net radiation is

1134
01:09:46,579 --> 01:09:53,449
so valuable but net radiometers are more

1135
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:56,210
expensive instruments so few people use

1136
01:09:53,449 --> 01:09:58,819
them and when they don't use them

1137
01:09:56,210 --> 01:10:02,329
they're trying to model these fluxes all

1138
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:05,559
of them and it can measure this big one

1139
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:09,680
and then you try to model the rest and

1140
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:11,660
some years ago Rick Allen who was now he

1141
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:14,829
was here at the University for many

1142
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:17,569
years now he's at Kimberly Idaho but he

1143
01:10:14,829 --> 01:10:19,550
broke part of a book chapter and after

1144
01:10:17,569 --> 01:10:20,960
testing at the time a bunch of

1145
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:24,590
instruments from net radiation

1146
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,989
he said these instruments have

1147
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:30,319
sufficient problems that it's more

1148
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:33,229
accurate to model the net radiation

1149
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:35,420
fluxes than it is to measure them that's

1150
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:39,339
a sentence in that it's a chapter in a

1151
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:41,239
book I think it's FAO 56 since then

1152
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,920
Blanc West at all

1153
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:47,179
did a big study with the bunch of net

1154
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,920
radiometers and as I recall nearly all

1155
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:51,020
of the net radiometers were more

1156
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,460
accurate than the models the only ones

1157
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:56,360
that weren't were the very cheapest

1158
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:59,810
models all even even the cheapest net

1159
01:10:56,359 --> 01:11:02,389
radiometers so that's the evolution of

1160
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:07,430
instruments they're they're better and

1161
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:08,930
cheaper and then yeah you can see if you

1162
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:11,659
can get this number right with an

1163
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:13,340
instrument wow you're really you're

1164
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:16,939
getting there because now you just got a

1165
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:20,150
couple other components but in my

1166
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:22,639
experience if a user just puts the

1167
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:25,789
instrument out there without any

1168
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,289
understanding of all this stuff they

1169
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:30,409
have no idea when they're klett

1170
01:11:27,289 --> 01:11:31,939
getting bad data and if you understand

1171
01:11:30,409 --> 01:11:33,619
the stuff you can look up these lines

1172
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:36,349
and say this can't be right

1173
01:11:33,619 --> 01:11:40,099
right here and we'd better go check the

1174
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:54,500
instrument and that's worth a lot to

1175
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:56,870
have that background you you would think

1176
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:59,510
they would have a huge effect on this if

1177
01:11:56,869 --> 01:12:01,340
you asked the to false the population

1178
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:03,980
you know the ever and so what does they

1179
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:07,250
have a huge effect on it if you go out

1180
01:12:03,979 --> 01:12:09,919
with our radiometers and measure this

1181
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:13,850
there's hazy right so this is going to

1182
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:17,899
be less wait a minute those inversions

1183
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:19,760
are 1 to 300 meters thick when you look

1184
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:22,069
sideways at the mountains you can see

1185
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,780
the haze now go out an inversion and

1186
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:26,389
look up and tell me if you can see the

1187
01:12:23,779 --> 01:12:28,670
haze it's not deep enough you can't that

1188
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:31,910
sky looks fine you have to be looking

1189
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:36,680
through an air mass of several two or

1190
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:38,960
three or four to see the haze so this

1191
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:41,030
incoming shortwave is actually hard to

1192
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,550
measure during I mean hard to hard could

1193
01:12:41,029 --> 01:12:46,460
tell that there's an inversion based on

1194
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:50,329
attenuation of shortwave we could if we

1195
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:52,279
had 100 4 or 500 meters up and one at

1196
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:55,100
the ground we could we could see it but

1197
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:57,349
it's it's it's hard to see but this

1198
01:12:55,100 --> 01:13:00,110
tells you why we get cold inversions

1199
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:01,340
snow on the ground and we can't heat the

1200
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:03,460
ground up because there's snow on the

1201
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,460
ground

1202
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:16,710
yeah some because there's crap in the

1203
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:20,670
air but here's an example so we all we

1204
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:23,279
keep study in the website PM 2.5 and we

1205
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:28,909
say wow this is a terrible day it's up

1206
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:33,659
to 50 what are the units on that well

1207
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:37,500
micrograms per cubic meter Wow

1208
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:40,680
a microgram I mean a paperclip does a

1209
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:44,699
gram and so this is a millionth of a

1210
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:48,600
paperclip per meter it's the amount the

1211
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:50,069
weight of the particles is tiny and even

1212
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,010
though they're bad for our lungs there's

1213
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:55,439
no doubt about that the optical effects

1214
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:59,070
are smaller than you might think

1215
01:13:55,439 --> 01:14:01,399
so these fluxes don't change much from

1216
01:13:59,069 --> 01:14:06,299
those they change more with humidity

1217
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:08,689
humidity can be 3 4 % of the well in the

1218
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:11,909
winter it might be 1 or 2 percent but

1219
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:15,569
humidity is many orders of magnitude

1220
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:17,279
greater than the PM 2.5 and small

1221
01:14:15,569 --> 01:14:19,130
changes in humidity would have a bigger

1222
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:24,059
effect than big changes in the

1223
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:26,369
particulate matter but those are

1224
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:28,520
examples of this stuff that you know how

1225
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:31,519
would this apply to different things

1226
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,520
okay

1227
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:40,109
tomorrow we'll model planet Earth ah

1228
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:42,800
I've promised a key for a equals MC

1229
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:46,429
squared which I already showed you but

1230
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,430
here it is and

1231
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:56,800
that's it that's a good example of a

1232
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:59,170
question where you can't rely on your

1233
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:03,630
intuition to get the answer you have to

1234
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:03,630
follow the rules and and get it

1235
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:20,949
