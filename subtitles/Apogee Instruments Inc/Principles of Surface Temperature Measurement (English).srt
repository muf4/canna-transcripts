00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,889
I'm  Bruce Bugbee, welcome to the next installment of a series of talks on

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:10,769
principles of environmental measurement. Today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,440
measurement of surface temperature. It is a very powerful and yet very challenging

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:24,130
measurement. Many people make errors in this measurement. Our goal is to help you

5
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:28,710
eliminate the errors. I'm joined in this effort by Mark Blonquist, he and I have

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,109
worked together for more than 10 years trying to make accurate measurements of

7
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:38,890
surface temperature. So, you would think you could just take a sensor and put it

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,878
on a surface and measure the surface temperature, but lets draw a little diagram

9
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:50,869
to show the problems with that. Here's the surface, now we take a sensor and put

10
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:56,578
it on the surface right against it, and this sensor has some wires coming out to

11
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:04,909
go to a datalogger, but as you can see this part of the sensor is touching the

12
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:13,000
surface and measuring that.  Over here we have air temperature touching all the rest of

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,180
the sensor. So anytime you do this it's a combination of air temperature and

14
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,530
surface temperature. Now this measurement gets better if you can get a very tiny

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:31,728
sensor, it's better, but it's still not the true surface temperature. It's always

16
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:36,890
an average and then people dig holes and puncture and put sensors in here and do

17
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,060
things like that. Now you're measuring the surface, plus the

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,000
temperature behind the surface, so anytime you try and do this with a

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,310
physical sensor you can never get the true surface temperature. That's why we

20
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,040
use infrared sensors, and on this diagram I can draw a sensor like this which

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,500
measure all only the true radiation coming right from the surface, whether

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,300
it's a soil surface, leaf surface, or a road surface it's the true

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,090
surface temperature. Let's take a look at some of the applications of this. The

24
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,150
biggest use of Apogee sensors has been in agriculture for canopy stomatal

25
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:33,530
conductance or irrigation scheduling of plants here's a couple of examples in

26
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,849
the field. Here's the sensor pointing at a corn canopy. Here's one sensor over a

27
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:45,409
small plant. This has allowed us to precision irrigate crops and determined

28
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:51,240
the water status of plants, precision water stressed plants, by measuring the

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,460
canopy surface this principle is real simple anything thats out of water heats up

30
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,610
if there's plenty of water

31
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,980
you stay cool. We've joked about having a headband and a little

32
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:07,569
infrared sensor pointed at your forehead for runners to tell when they need

33
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,709
to drink more water, if

34
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,580
their foreheads heating up they need more water. It's the same thing with plants, so this

35
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,010
is a huge application. Another application is predicting snow melt.

36
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:24,929
Here's high in the mountains the surface temperature changes rapidly, we want to

37
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,200
know how fast that snow is melting and running down for agriculture this is a

38
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:36,789
huge area of research worldwide because tiny changes in global temperature mean

39
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:43,000
that the snow melts a lot faster and we get the water earlier and we run out at the

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,139
end of the summer. We really need to predict snow melt, and there's many

41
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:52,429
scientists around the world engaged in this. A third application is transportation,

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,010
icy road analysis. This is in Italy here's an Apogee sensor off the corner

43
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:02,859
of their truck, telling them when to put salt down. It's a real-time response telling

44
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,400
them to put salt down. You can also use these on a bridge. Danger ice on

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,689
bridge, and that's determined by the temperature of the bridge. So just a couple

46
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:18,608
of applications. Now let's start looking at some of the key things, emissivity

47
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,370
this is one of the most

48
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:29,899
challenging things to understand. This is the fraction of radiation from a surface

49
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:39,939
that gets to the sensor. Now lets back up and go to the fundamental equation that

50
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:52,600
starts all this this is,  E is for energy

51
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,689
equals a constant called Sigma. This is the Stefan Boltzmann constant, you can look it up. This is

52
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:08,829
multiplied by temperature so this is pretty simple. If this is a constant

53
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:15,198
energy is proportional to temperature. If the temperature goes up, the energy goes

54
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,180
up this is fundamentally how we tell radiation from a surface is the energy

55
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:28,220
emitted from it. Here's where it gets complicated this is temperature in

56
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,410
Kelvin so a 1

57
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,240
Kelvin temperature is about 300 in a room. A 1 degree C change is only one

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,889
part in 300 parts so it's a small change in energy, but this is one of the few

59
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:53,710
things in science that is raised to the fourth power. Kelvin temperature raised to

60
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:59,560
the fourth power is energy so obviously this is a very non linear thing we've

61
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,030
got graphs on the website that shows this exact relationship. It gets more

62
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:15,978
challenging, this is only true for an object that is

63
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:24,219
infinitely black and it radiates all of its energy to the surface.

64
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:31,450
A third parameter is emissivity. This

65
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,159
is a number

66
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:41,610
that ranges from 0 to 1, and it's a multiplier times this whole thing. So we

67
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,460
need to know

68
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:47,519
emissivity the surface, that's characteristic of the surface, then we put

69
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:54,539
this constant in, this Sigma, and then we solve based on the energy. We solve

70
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,660
temperature at the surface. This is called this Stefan Boltzmann law.

71
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,420
Boltzmann

72
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,840
came up with that Stefan added to it, it's fundamental to all radiation

73
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,969
physics. You don't need to know this law to use them, but it helps to understand

74
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,710
the principles, particularly this idea

75
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:23,399
emissivity. So let's take a look at emissivity. To get accuracy we

76
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:30,699
custom calibrate every sensor this is twelve sensors in a complex oven that

77
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,879
controls temperature and they're further controlled here. The sensor bodies are

78
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,709
controlled at one temperature, the targets controlled at another

79
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:45,279
temperature. Every single sensor is custom calibrated, using this device.

80
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,049
So if we know temperature we can get radiation, but when we point these at

81
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,650
something we need to know that their point to get something very black.

82
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,299
Let's take a look at how black that is. This is the errors by the way.

83
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:06,879
They're specified at plus and minus 0.2 degrees. This is a typical 12 sensors.

84
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,930
This two times the standard deviation is only 0.12, so it's a generous spec to

85
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:21,199
say there plus and minus 2. And, look at the temperature range from min -30 to 65 or 70

86
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,469
out here. They're calibrated over a wide temperature range, this is replica

87
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,010
sensors on top of each other.

88
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,599
So now lets take a look at that blackbody we take the top off. This looks like a hole

89
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,110
right? This is not a whole this is a cavity, that's painted very flat black,

90
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,450
it's a cone shape

91
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,009
cavity and it looks like its a whole, you could put your hand in it and that's what's

92
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:58,360
called the blackbody. A blackbody has an emissivity very close to 1.0.

93
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,210
In fact nothing really can theoretically get to 1.0, so this

94
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:12,710
blackbody is more like 0.999, and that's how we calibrate the sensors against

95
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:18,780
this blackbody keeping it purely black. Let's go back to this concept of

96
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,970
emissivity.

97
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:27,649
Here's a typical surface and I'm going to  show you some emissivities in a minute.

98
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:35,629
A plant canopy can have an emissivity very close to 1.0. Wow, that's so close to

99
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:42,679
1.0 lets just call it 1.0,and call it good, but 98% of the radiation comes from

100
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,549
the surface. And now, let's look at where the rest of the radiation comes from. The

101
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:59,889
other part comes from the sky, and this part right here, this tiny arrow, is 0.02 or 2%

102
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:07,480
from the sky. This sensor is averaging, in some cases of very cold sky

103
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,769
temperature with the temperature of the canopy and it's important to correct for

104
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:20,949
this in the software of the sensor. This is well characterized, we know the typical

105
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:29,960
emissivities of canopies so we can use this to pinpoint measurements. There's

106
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:39,040
the equation fraction reflected is 1 minus the emissivity so its 0.2. Okay this is the

107
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,809
correction factor,

108
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:46,389
this is the equation, but it's more important to know the inputs:

109
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:53,659
measured temperature of the sensor, that's this temperature right here;

110
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:59,209
background temperature, up here as the sky temperature in degrees C; and then we

111
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:05,850
need to know this. Now we typically look this number up, we measure this, we

112
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,220
measure this, and we can solve for the canopy temperature. I'm not going to go

113
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,278
into the details of this equation right here, but suffice it to say that this is

114
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,230
well described on the Apogee website and we've described it in manuscript we have

115
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:29,970
written. The take-home message is all objects measure the object plus averaging

116
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,990
and sum of the background temperature. If you keep that in mind you realize the

117
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:43,860
errors you can get into.Let's take an example clear day, 25 degrees

118
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,080
measured, the background is -40, that's a typical background of the

119
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,040
very clear sky, the infinity of outer space is 0 Kelvin so that tells you

120
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,419
why we get such cold sky temperatures. Emissivity 0.98.

121
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:09,979
What we measured was 25, and the actual surface temperature was 25.95 almost a 1

122
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:16,519
degrees C error if we don't account for emissivity, even though this is very high.

123
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,819
Let's take a cloudy day on here.

124
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,589
25 now the sky is much warmer and this error is much smaller on a cloudy day, so

125
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,310
again these are examples of why it's so important to correct for emissivity.

126
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:38,199
Okay, let's look at the field of

127
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:45,759
view. All sensors have a cone shape field of view here is the target,

128
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,779
and it's critical to understand what you're looking at.

129
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:58,409
So to do the trigonometry of this, we've got  this angle here and this angle

130
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:07,439
here, and now we've got a right angle.  This is the half angle here, so this

131
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:15,490
describes how big the target is. Apogee describes us in two ways: the ratio of

132
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:24,950
the distance to the target to the target diameter, so this ratio you don't need to

133
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:31,730
know trigonometry to understand that ratio; we also describe it as a half

134
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,909
angle right here, this distance here.

135
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:40,219
Apogee sells a series of sensors at different fields of view, but it's

136
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,800
imperative to know what you're looking at because you do not want to be

137
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,659
averaging the sky, the sidewalks, other things off in the sides. It's important

138
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:54,230
that this be small, but it's even more important that we know what we're

139
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,389
looking at. This is described in two ways distance to target divided by

140
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:10,059
target diameter and then angle. Let's take a look and the area that is

141
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:15,329
measured with this. Depends on three things: this field of view that we just

142
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:22,340
talked about; obviously mounting height, the higher up if the sensor is up here

143
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,860
same field if you were going to see a much larger circle, so that's the second

144
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:36,480
parameter; and then the angle. We don't always point these down sometimes and often

145
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:45,029
we point them like this, and now its sees an oval shape out here. These

146
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,009
three parameters determine what we're looking at.

147
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,870
The next slide walks you through this,

148
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,529
on what we see with these. This is example, here's one that was 22 degrees

149
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,100
field of view. This is one of the Apogee sensors. Let's look at the

150
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,980
field of view options.

151
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:12,940
These are 1 2 3 4 options that Apogee offers for fields of view, and this is an

152
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,730
example over a target. Narrow, medium, wider, and then rectangular. The

153
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,420
rectangular you don't want to see any sky, we don't want to see any ground. Because this

154
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:25,620
is important

155
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:32,909
Apogee has a field of view tool.

156
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:41,189
You can find this on the Apogee website. You put in the type of sensor you have, the model

157
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:47,310
number, it'll take the angles, and then it tells you the area that's integrated. It does this by

158
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:52,399
doing a bunch of trigonometry calculations. It's just a worksheet you type

159
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,029
in the inputs and it tells you the area. All of these are really to help you

160
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:02,110
fully understand what you're looking at, what's in the field of view what's not.

161
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:09,029
It's important to be sufficiently narrow, but it's important not to see bad things.

162
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:16,750
These are the four options, pictures of them, here's that rectangular,

163
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,139
narrow, medium, wide. These are on the website, but  lots of options to

164
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:30,210
pinpoint what you're looking. Next critical thing, is the infrared spectral

165
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:40,040
response sensors can cover a wide range, but it's important not to measure water

166
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:46,129
vapor in the air. We want to see right through the atmosphere right to the

167
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:53,590
surface. Lower quality sensors measure much of this radiation

168
00:16:53,590 --> 00:17:03,190
and this slide shows us some of the interferences from these things.

169
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:10,130
Water vapor interferes right here. This is water vapor in the air. We do not want

170
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,110
to measure the water vapor in the air. We want to see right through it, and I think

171
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,419
we've got over here

172
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,830
carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide in the air has bands down here that absorb, but there's this

173
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:29,789
atmospheric window as it's called. 8 to 14 microns in which neither water

174
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:36,099
vapor nor carbon dioxide interfere with the infrared signal. Apogee sensors

175
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:41,599
are calibrated just to measure this wavelength, which means they can see

176
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,939
through many kilometres of atmosphere because it's very transparent. This is

177
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:55,360
something that defines the sensor, defines how its calibrated. Once

178
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,229
it's done all you need to know is it's calibrated to utilize the

179
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,710
atmospheric window. It's not something you need to know on a

180
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,380
day-to-day basis when you're using it,  except when you're correct for the

181
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:15,770
emissivity. It is important to know that it does atmospheric window. So what do we

182
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:22,889
do when we're trying to measure a canopy and it doesn't cover all the ground? This

183
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:28,800
is a common problem, you can't just pointed at the plant. If we put it

184
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:38,690
right here we could get only the plant, but plants move

185
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:45,890
around we want to average bigger areas. It's not possible to always have it

186
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:54,680
right above a plant.  In this scenario this fraction of the radiation is from the

187
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,820
ground and this fraction is from the plant. So we have a case of partial canopy cover.

188
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,778
What this is measuring

189
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:11,608
is both of these together. To solve that, we put it on an angle, and now the

190
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:19,348
same field of view, look at this, all plants. It doesn't see the ground. This is

191
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:24,019
only possible with a narrow field of view so you can see over the top of the field.

192
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,538
This is a common application to mounted it at an angle so we only see the

193
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:34,858
plants. There are still cases with young plants where you see some of the

194
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:42,418
ground, and the next slide shows that.  To separate the ground from the

195
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:51,379
plants, we measure the soil temperature, I'll put degrees C right here and this degrees C

196
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:56,608
plant, and then what we measure up here. We mathematically separate out the

197
00:19:56,608 --> 00:20:03,048
plant temperature from the signal here and the measured soil temperature.

198
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:07,548
This is the approach fraction of canopy, fraction of ground. It's possible to

199
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:12,668
calculate these fractions, and we have some manuscripts that explain doing this.

200
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:18,999
It's a common problem. Here's the equation, temperature of the canopy, this is all

201
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:23,538
to the fourth power, all done in software in the datalogger, temperature of the

202
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:32,398
surface, temperature the soil calculating canopy temperature. Let's start

203
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:41,408
using these to calculate what we call canopy stomatal conductance. If we

204
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:50,559
put a sensor right here, and we pointed at this leaf, seeing the leaf.

205
00:20:50,558 --> 00:21:00,088
Let's say the leaf is slightly above air temperature, 2 degrees above air

206
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:04,579
temperature, we write in our notebooks this leaf is water stressed

207
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:10,468
because the leaves are hotter than the air and that would be correct, but now the

208
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:16,288
wind comes up. Here's conduction and convection. The wind comes up, the leaf

209
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:17,019
cools off

210
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:22,000
well we write in our notebooks, oh, the water stress went away. It didn't go away

211
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,279
the wind started blowing so we have to measure and correct for the effect of

212
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,879
wind. The Sun goes under a cloud we have to measure and correct for the effect of

213
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:41,160
wind speed. We also have to measure the relative humidity of the air that

214
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,040
determines the driving gradient. If the air is humid the plants are going to

215
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,470
warm up. They're not out of water. They just can't cool from transporation as

216
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:58,750
fast. All of these parameters in here are necessary to pinpoint water stress

217
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,819
for plants over a wide range of environments.

218
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:11,039
This is a example slide that we used to show this, and the overriding equation

219
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,759
for this is Rn, which is net radiation. That's the sum of this

220
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:26,210
outgoing shortwave, incoming shortwave, incoming long wave, and over here leaf

221
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:32,690
radiation. These four all go into net radiation. That equals

222
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:42,610
transportation, and I'll put Tr for transportation, + conduction

223
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:51,309
and convection, and usually that's called H. This is

224
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:57,559
a simple equation, and by measuring all these we pinpoint the water status of

225
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:04,879
the plant. Let's take another look at this in another diagram. This is a lot of

226
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,460
equations, a lot of math, but this is where this comes from. This is from this

227
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,750
manuscript by Mark Blonquist, our colleague John Norman, at the University

228
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:24,450
of Wisconsin, and myself, from 2009. It's a paper that works through all of this, and

229
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,440
I refer you to this paper for details, but here's that equation

230
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,649
I just drew.  Net radiation, H is for conduction and convection, and delta E is

231
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:41,018
for transpiration, and this is photosynthesis some of the energy goes

232
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:50,220
into photosynthesis in this equation and we account for that. This H  is further

233
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,850
broken down into the canopy to air temperatures multiplied by conductance that

234
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:04,259
gives us H. It  is further broken down into transportation, this difference here is

235
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:11,298
saturation vapor pressure. We measure these parameters calculate transporation

236
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:18,528
and this canopy and stomatal conductance to get gT, canopy and stomatal

237
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:23,210
conductance. These are all the parameters necessary to measure that. It is  a lot of

238
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:30,450
parameters, but the information is extremely valuable. So, we take theses

239
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:38,669
equations and substitute them all in this. This is part of Mark's excellence

240
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:45,080
in advanced algebra, and we get an equation that integrates all of them

241
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:52,000
here. This is canopy stomatal conductance mathematically.

242
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,269
This equation is all done in datalogger

243
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:03,440
with these inputs, and we've done this now over many fields to

244
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,370
pinpoint water status. I'd like to show you some of that data. The next

245
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:14,459
slide shows that. The advantage of this it's a physiological variables related

246
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,730
to stomatal conductance and everything's in here. It can work anywhere in the world

247
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:26,720
as long as you have these inputs to it. Let's take a look at some of these

248
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,960
examples. This was at Nebraska a couple summers ago that we measured. We'd have a

249
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,419
model that gives us the potential stomal conductance. If the plant is well

250
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:41,120
watered

251
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:48,459
it should transpire at the potential rate. You can see here's day and night

252
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,009
and day, in the night stomates are closed. Some of these aren't smooth because

253
00:25:55,009 --> 00:26:02,529
there was clouds  and other parameters. This is our measured

254
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:10,279
parameters. So, what we calculate is the ratio of these two. How

255
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:16,779
open were the stomates? This is canopy stomatal conductance in moles per meter

256
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:22,428
squared per second, a fundamental measurement, the ratio of actual to

257
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:28,130
potential. That's what this is, the potential

258
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,890
should always be 1.0. Now here are some cases where it got above 1.0, and we think this was wet

259
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,280
leaves that made this go above 1.0. Because obviously you  should never get above the

260
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:45,670
potential. But look what happens after a rainfall. Here

261
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,269
it gets less. Now look at what happens in the day, it also went down during the

262
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:56,029
course of the day. There were more open in the morning than the evening, further down

263
00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:02,490
as they dried out.  This is the slope of this.

264
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,230
Now let's look at what happens right here, another rainfall, 20 millimetres of

265
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:14,150
rainfall, happen right here. The stomates to  jump back up to their potential

266
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:21,090
and even slightly above, and then they started that downward march again.

267
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:30,569
This is the power of using infrared thermometry to sort out the water

268
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:35,599
potential and the stomatal conductance of the plants. This is the average

269
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:42,099
conductance of all of the leaves in the field of view of the plant, and it's an

270
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:47,949
automated measurement. It can be made day after day.

271
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:54,620
Let's look at our next parameter. This is a graph of potential

272
00:27:54,619 --> 00:28:01,028
canopy stomatal conductance and actual. Here's our 1.0 to 1.0 line. If

273
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:07,069
they're always near the potential they'll fall on that line. They're close to this.

274
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,408


275
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:12,600
The other environmental parameters affect this; humidity, wind, solar

276
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:17,908
radiation, but each case they're close to their potential. What happened up here?

277
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:26,220
This we think is wet leaves. When the leaves are wet we get numbers that are

278
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:33,440
above 1.0. There are just a few values, but this shows the power of this technique for

279
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,190
pinpointing water stress in plants.

280
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:46,700
Conclusion. Canopy temperatures can be used to determine plant canopy water

281
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,090
stress and in this example canopy stomatal conductance. There are simple

282
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:57,949
methods to do this, and complex methods are the ones I've described here, where

283
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,569
we measure all the parameters and account for all of them. The complex

284
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:07,879
measurements work over a wider range of conditions than the simple measurements.

285
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,179
Emissivity, the correction for that can be significant.

286
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:18,500
So we measure sky temperature and mathematically correct or that. Then

287
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,759
field of view, we talked about that. Partial canopy cover we need to sort

288
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:30,089
that out. This is the reference to the paper we're talking about. Apogee can

289
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:36,490
give you copies of this. It is on the website. This shows the details of

290
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:42,538
making this measurement. One more slide I want to talk about. Maintenance of

291
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:48,519
these sensors. It's one thing to get a new sensor and get accurate data, but how

292
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,878
about week after week, month after month getting accurate data.

293
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:59,178
Three things cause problems: one optical path interferences, this is true of

294
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:03,979
all radiation measurement instruments. Spiders

295
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:10,139
can make a nest inside this window. Some places never see this, other places

296
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:15,939
have a lot of spiders. There's a spider nest inside that window. When that

297
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,999
happens the sensor suddenly flat lines it just starts raining its own

298
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:25,449
temperature. You can tell when it happens, and you get in there with the q-tip.

299
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:30,419
This is so important that Apogee sells scientific q-tips with this. Put it

300
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,579
right in the sensor and you can clean that right out.

301
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:39,298
You can also use methanol to further clean this, sometimes it can be helpful, or

302
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:44,759
just water.  But, you gotta keep that sensor clean. Second thing, is calcium

303
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,118
deposits.

304
00:30:47,118 --> 00:30:54,828
Sprinkler irrigation blasts this thing day after day. If it is being hit by

305
00:30:54,828 --> 00:31:00,479
moisture it  doesn't hurt the sensor, this is very waterproof, but it evaporates and

306
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:06,509
it leaves a little film. A hard water film on the inside window of the sensor. This only

307
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:10,659
happens when you have water shooting up on it, that evaporates get this film.

308
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:16,509
People sometimes use things like Windex to get that off, that doesn't help.

309
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:23,709
You have to clean calcium with a dilute acid, and in fact it doesn't have to be that

310
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:30,019
dilute because the sensor is very rugged. And again, take the q-tips

311
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:36,019
dip them, vinegar can work or a dilute acid. You can clean it with acid, it comes right off.

312
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:42,348
Don't try things like acetone to clean it. That doesn't clean up salt deposits.

313
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:47,878
Third, is dust and dirt. This happens in all windows, it happens in the

314
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:55,078
windows  of your house. This you can clean with window cleaning products, like

315
00:31:55,078 --> 00:32:02,509
ammonium, methanol, even acetone in here. The key don't

316
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:04,589
push too hard because you scratch the window.

317
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:10,199
Let the chemistry clean the window, not mechanically. Here's the Apogee

318
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:19,259
website that talks about caring for this Apogee radiometer. So, that's the

319
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:25,339
summary of the principles to make this measurement. The things you need to watch

320
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:30,408
out for. You can spend your life getting better and better at this, but you can

321
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:36,140
see I think that this is a very powerful measurement. We're excited to work with

322
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,480
you, to help you collect better data. Thanks for listening.
