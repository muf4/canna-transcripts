00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,875
Communication is vital in this scientific world

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:04,125
and at Apogee Instruments

3
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,375
we're always trying to find ways to communicate more

4
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:09,000
effectively with scientists of all ages.

5
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,208
Mark Blonquist

6
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,291
the chief scientist of Apogee Instruments

7
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,916
will now highlight some of the features

8
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,500
and the benefits of the Apogee Cloudburst

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,291
in a way that today's youth will better understand.

10
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,332
Y'all said "this ain't it chief" to cheugy

11
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,415
tipping bucket gauges that lo-key

12
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:35,415
struggle measuring snow

13
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:38,582
and need tonsa power just to function.

14
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,832
Well, precip monitoring got a glow up,

15
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:44,790
and tipping bucket gauges are never gonna clap back.

16
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:49,415
Cloudburst weighing precipitation gauge has entered the chat.

17
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:52,000
Your new Bougie weather MVP

18
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,957
that's finna live rent free in your head.

19
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:58,040
this Sigma doesn't need the heat to measure rain

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,457
snow and even hail with OP accuracy

21
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,875
with S tier sensitivity,

22
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,250
it slaps at recording even the smallest amount of rain.

23
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:13,790
Making it the move for all you meteorologists

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,957
and climate nerds.

25
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,875
NGL its mogging design is lightweight

26
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:21,582
easy to set up and built to last.

27
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,665
You can eat that boy anywhere

28
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:25,165
start collecting data.

29
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:29,040
Fat snow trying to block the inlet,

30
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:33,040
Say less. We've got a heated option will get you the W.

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,750
So I'mma put the fries in the bag.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,582
Apogee's Cloudburst is the goat of precipitation gauges.

33
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,790
Built different, never misses,

34
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,665
and straight up puts your life on easy mode.

35
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,457
Now let that cook bruh.

36
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:51,375
If you have any question...

37
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:55,000
If you have any questions about the Apogee Cloudburst,

38
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,957
leave them in the comment section below.

39
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:59,457
If you have any questions about "brainrot" slang,

40
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:04,915
I don't know, ask the neighborhood middle school boy.

41
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:06,707
He's probably a good start.

42
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,125
oh man
