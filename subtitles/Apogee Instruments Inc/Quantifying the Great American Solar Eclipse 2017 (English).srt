1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
I'm Bruce Bugbee president of Apogee Instruments,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:09,678
and in this video I'd like to show you how we used Apogee instruments to monitor

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:18,560
the radiation characteristics that occurred during the solar eclipse, which happened a few days ago.

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,679
As everybody knows it went across the United States, didn't quite go across

5
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:33,140
Apogee Instruments headquarters here in Logan, Utah so a couple of colleagues and I went to

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,399
Rexburg, Idaho where it was right close to the very middle of the of totality.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,960
I'd like to show you how close the Eclipse was to the Apogee headquarters.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,740
We went up to Rexburg, Idaho right here on the map.

9
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,740
Logan, Utah is right below Franklin County it's about right here.

10
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:03,119
We just drove up to Rexburg right near the center line so we got an excellent viewing angle for the Eclipse.

11
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:11,099
We had a camera running the whole time to record how dark it got and

12
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,739
for people that were in 96, 97 percent totality that's not nearly the same as

13
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:22,739
being in 100% of totality. This is the video we ran.

14
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,179
Here's the apogee setup here and I'm going to talk about these in a minute.

15
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,859
We had three laptops recording this. We all had our solar glasses.

16
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:36,799
This is just a 30 second video to give you a sense of how dark it is. Here we go it is.

17
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,819
This a colleague Tyler Volk from New York University that's written like seven books now on

18
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:51,478
mega patterns and he was with us. Right here is when it's close to totality.

19
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:58,980
You can see it's not quite as dark as a full moon. It lasted two minutes and 20 seconds in Rexburg.

20
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,500
We're not gonna show the entire two minutes. We sped it up here

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,340
starting to get light, I'm getting pictures, the street lights came on, it's dark,

22
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,719
and now that Sun comes out just to crack and it very quickly became light out.

23
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,800
This is in a rural area, not rural sorry, it's in Rexburg, Idaho but it was not near downtown.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,530
We had a lot of neighbors coming by all kinds of neighbors, and we took a picture with the

25
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,390
neighborhood kids, which was especially interested in the whole thing right

26
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:39,059
after the Sun started to come back out. Here's the instruments we used.

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,180
We used an Apogee net radiometer here. We used an Apogee quantum sensor here,

28
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:52,060
three spectroradiometers to look at color changes during the Eclipse, and an up and

29
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,159
down infrared sensors to do sky temperature and ground temperature.

30
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,780
Then of course an Apogee aspirated shield for precision measurements of air temperature.

31
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,599
These next several slides now show you the changes that occurred during the Eclipse.

32
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,519
This is not what we might call rocket science, NASA measures this stuff as well.

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,040
It's just that here we were measuring it ourselves not relying on NASA's data.

34
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:29,099
This is the picture I took of the Eclipse as it looked in Rexburg and it looks like other people's pictures.

35
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:36,759
Its just with the standard camera. Eclipses are really a unique event they don't occur

36
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:43,399
on other planets in our solar system. Let me see if I can show you how unique they are.

37
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:58,020
Here's the Sun and in fact I want to show you the Sun in yellow to get it anatomically correct.

38
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,340
The Sun is 400 times bigger than the moon.

39
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,240
Over here is the earth and we're gonna put the earth right there on this side of the screen.

40
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,860
The moon as everybody knows is just a little dot right there.

41
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:24,580
The Sun is 400 times farther from the earth than the moon is from the earth, but the Sun is also 400 times

42
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:32,659
bigger than the moon.

43
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:41,680
So the moon cast just enough shadow right there to give us a total solar eclipse.

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:50,959
It's a remarkable thing just happens in a small area. What happened to the environmental conditions?

45
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,959
The first one is photosynthetic radiation and it's closely related to visible light. Here's the morning.

46
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,239
Here's the sensor, an Apogee full-spectrum quantum sensor, the morning here.

47
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,139
We moved the table just a tiny bit there's a little hiccup.

48
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:15,459
This is going up, up, up, up, up until the Eclipse starts right there and as soon as the moon started to move in

49
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,399
front of the Sun it started a curve down.

50
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,819
We really had an hour, over an hour, of watching the moon get closer and closer to the Sun.

51
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:30,180
It goes down. We get totality right here and finally it starts to come back up.

52
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,319
Everybody said let's go we're done, let's go and I said oh no, no we gotta wait to keep the instruments here

53
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,460
till this levels out to complete the study.

54
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:48,370
This point right here is when it's a total eclipse it is about as dark as a night with a full moon,

55
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,658
and the interesting part of that is the full moon takes a long gradual time this

56
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,920
happens just very quickly.

57
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:04,480
Even five minutes before totality it's still as bright as a cloudy day. It is just as that moment right here.

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:21,060
Full moon we usually consider to be 0.05 micromoles per meter squared per second.

59
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:29,329
Now we didn't have the adequate resolution to document this, but I know

60
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,740
it didn't quite go down to this dark. You could see that in the video.

61
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:42,100
It was brighter than it would have been on a full moon but still really dark as indicated by going to zero.

62
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,640
What happened to the other radiation characteristics?

63
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,579
Here's the Apogee net radiometer. Here's the actual instrument right here.

64
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:54,379
Remember that this has shortwave on one side and long-wave on the other.

65
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:02,779
Here's the incoming and outgoing shortwave. The incoming shortwave looks just like photosynthetic.

66
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:08,319
The outgoing also decreased because there was less light to reflect.

67
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:18,620
This was over a grassy surface and grass reflects about 20 to 25 percent of the solar radiation.

68
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:25,500
Let's look at the ratio of these two during the Eclipse. The ratio of these two has a special name albedo.

69
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,800
This graph shows the albedo. It's a flat line and right here we got division by

70
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,480
zero because the numbers were so close to zero. It gets really noisy right in

71
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,600
the middle of the Eclipse, but the Eclipse did very little to the albedo,

72
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:50,120
the reflectance of the shortwave.That shows how well the Apogee instrument

73
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,660
worked because it's very flat through all of this.

74
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,740
The other side of this does long wave radiation. You can see the blacktop.

75
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,639
Here's the long wave. Look at these lines very flat.

76
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:12,219
The incoming long wave right through here is just remarkably flat.

77
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:19,220
Overall the sky temperature changed very little during the Eclipse.

78
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:27,460
The outgoing longwave dipped a little bit because the surface of the ground got colder without the radiation.

79
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:32,759
Let's look at in detail at the surface temperature.

80
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,240
Here's the net, all four components added together.

81
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,940
It dips below zero like it does at night so the earth is cooling because it's a negative net radiation.

82
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,040
The sum of  these four numbers is the net and it's negative.

83
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:55,860
The negative radiation meant much cooler surface temperatures and much cooler air temperatures.

84
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,379
Let's start with air temperature. The line curves down here.

85
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:13,159
The air temperature dropped from aout 20 to about 17, but look at what happened to the surface temperature.

86
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:21,980
That went from about 23 down to about 12 during the eclipse. This is the temperature of the ground.

87
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,436
Ground temperature is measured with the Apogee infrared sensor. We had one up and one down.

88
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:35,680
I'll show you that up in a second. Notice that the air temperature and the ground temperature took a while

89
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,479
to recover after this radiation came back up, it took a while to warm back up.

90
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,480
This was very noticeable. We were putting on coats in preparation for the cold temperature.

91
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:57,200
Typically the ground temperature is far more responsive to solar radiation than the air as indicated here.

92
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:06,759
This is the sky temperature as measured with an upward facing infrared sensor, and look very

93
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:14,409
cold minus 50 Celsius and a flat line because the Apogee infrared sensor is

94
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:21,879
designed to see through the atmosphere, close to seeing the infinity of space.

95
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,299
So it gets very cold and that temperature changed very little during the eclipse.

96
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,379
We didn't expect that it would change and it didn't it stayed cold.

97
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:41,439
A tiny bit of warming later in the day when the temperature came back up but minimal effect on sky temperature.

98
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,140
The biggest change was the colors of light.

99
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:56,293
This is our spectroradiometers measuring from 350 to 1000 nanometers, and measuring from

100
00:10:56,293 --> 00:11:05,590
during the Eclipse to just after the Eclipse. What we predicted was by blocking the direct shortwave radiation

101
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:12,700
the blue component of radiation would increase because of Rayleigh scattering.

102
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,620
That's why the sky looks blue. The shorter wavelengths are reflected more

103
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:27,039
and increase.It happens at different Sun angles. We've blocked the direct

104
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,879
radiation and sure enough during the Eclipse

105
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:36,219
we got a higher fraction of blue light. Now keep in mind that during the Eclipse

106
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,460
these lines were way down here the radiometers picked up the blue shift

107
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,019
even though the intensity was many times less. That's because of auto integration

108
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:51,659
and the analyzers that we're able to do this. This is all normalized

109
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,579
out here so we can look at the relative spectral changes. This was a great fun

110
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,500
study to quantify these changes. We measured all the data some of it was on

111
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:09,320
the screen real time. People were coming by to watch it and it is a fun

112
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,320
documentation of the kinds of things Apogee radiometers can do during a solar

113
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,940
eclipse. Thanks for watching we'll look for you again in another video.
