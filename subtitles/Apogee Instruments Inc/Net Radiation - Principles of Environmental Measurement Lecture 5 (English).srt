1
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,399
I'm going to talk about net radiation specifically the four components and

2
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,869
then selection among sensors. Bruce will talk a bit about radiation frost and

3
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:36,329
non-destructive measurements of leaf chlorophyll, and then I'll talk about

4
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,660
hyper spectral reflectance. If we get that far and if people are interested, we

5
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,968
can speak a bit about soil oxygen and barometric pressure. We'll just see

6
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:55,500
where we're at after we get to the end of the reflectance stuff. As

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:03,628
long as interest is still there, people's eyes are open at that point. Alright so

8
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:09,599
as before if you have any questions please feel free to ask, I don't have

9
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:16,228
that many slides this time I might make use of the of the board. A lot of

10
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:21,829
what we've covered already when we talked about pyrometers and infrared

11
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:28,560
radiometers relates directly to net radiometers, the instruments that we use

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,868
to measure net radiation. We won't talk maybe as much about principles of

13
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:43,069
sensors in the in the net radiation section.

14
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,840
Net radiation is just the difference between incoming radiation at the

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,329
surface and outgoing radiation at the surface. There are both short wave

16
00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:02,950
and long ways components that we have to consider. I passed out a magnet if you

17
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,400
don't have one there's more down here and you're free to take one. It has the

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,920
exact same picture that you that you see right here. These are typical values of

19
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,979
the four different components that make up net radiation this would be

20
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:25,060
representative of a clear summer day over vegetation near solar noon so when

21
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,340
the Sun is in the middle of the sky.  The largest component of net radiation

22
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,349
is the incoming shortwave component, 1000 watts per meter squared is a reasonable

23
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:45,879
value for midday in the summertime. Then the vegetation or soil whatever is at

24
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,650
the surface in the summertime usually its vegetation, is a good absorber of

25
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,310
shortwave radiation so a much smaller amount is being reflected about 200

26
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,789
watts per meter squared is a good estimate for vegetation. The

27
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:08,069
difference between these two the incoming shortwave minus the outgoing

28
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:15,099
shortwave is net shortwave so we have a positive value of 800 watts per meter

29
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:21,310
squared, net shortwave at the surface. A term that you're probably all familiar

30
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:28,509
with is albedo. That's the the broadband shortwave reflectivity.

31
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:33,669
Essentially it's just the ratio of these two numbers in our example would be 200

32
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:40,839
divided by 1000. It's the reflected shortwave divided by the incoming shortwave that would be

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,909
0.2 or 20 %. That's a really reasonable value for for green

34
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:50,930
vegetation when the Sun is in the middle of the sky.

35
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,680
Now we switch over to the long-wave slide. We also have an incoming longwave

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,799
component and an emitted longwave component. If the sky is cloud free,

37
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,260
and a lot of you are just outside with me pointing infrared sensors up and

38
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,328
measuring the sky was quite cold, but we found that the clouds were a bit warmer

39
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:22,259
than the blue sky. The sky is emitting longwave radiation towards the

40
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:27,538
surface and the surface is emitting longwave radiation back towards the sky.

41
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:32,610
The reason the incoming radiation from the sky is lower than the emitted

42
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:39,060
radiation from the surface is the sky is colder than the ground surface. At least it

43
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,810
typically always is in them in the summertime especially if the sky is

44
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,970
clear. If it's cloudy, they can be pretty close and these numbers can be a lot

45
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:57,419
closer. If we were to actually take the measurements that we are making

46
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:02,759
outside, I think a lot of us were seeing like -20 or -30 Celsius for

47
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,329
the sky temperature that we were measuring with those infrared sensors,

48
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:11,370
and we put that temperature in the Stefan Boltzmann equation, let me just

49
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,899
write that over here on the board it was in an earlier slide but just to remind

50
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,288
everyone.

51
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:39,550
Energy is equal to a constant that we use is sigma multiplied by the absolute temperature

52
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,410
raised to the fourth power. If we were to take one of our measurements outside,

53
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,480
we'll just say the blue sky was negative 30 Celsius and we were to plug it into this

54
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,660
equation we would get a number that's a lot lower than 300 watts per meter

55
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,540
squared. The reason why is those infrared radiometers we were using outside

56
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:09,050
they're only measuring the wavelengths between 8 and 14 micron. You remember

57
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,910
from the infrared presentation that I gave this morning when we're trying to

58
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,970
measure temperature we have to have sensors to have a filter over them that

59
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,010
only gives us 8 to 14 micron because that's the atmospheric window where the

60
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,029
sensor can effectively see through the atmosphere to the surface that we're

61
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:33,409
trying to measure the temperature of. When we're trying to measure net

62
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:40,490
radiation we don't want the 8 to 14 micron filter on our longwave

63
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,090
radiation sensors because we're trying to measure all of the radiation

64
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:50,689
coming from either the atmosphere or the land surface. We're not that interested

65
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:55,550
in the temperature in other words and we  we don't want to see

66
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,850
through the atmosphere and measure the cold temperature we want to actually

67
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,020
capture the radiation coming from the air molecules and the clouds and

68
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:09,919
everything in in the air. Longwave sensors don't have an 8 to 14

69
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,040
micron sensor on them like the infrared temperature sensor does. That's why

70
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,040
if we were to plug in - 30 Celsius here we wouldn't get 300 watts

71
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,819
per meter squared. I can't remember what -30 Celsius is when we plug into

72
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:31,009
the Stefan Boltzmann equation, but it's a lot closer to like 150 or 200 watts per

73
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,569
meter squared. With that being said, the sky we're

74
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,969
talking about all of the long-wave wavelengths, the sky is still colder than

75
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,040
the ground surface and so there's less longwave coming in from the sky

76
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,240
than what's being emitted from the surface. In this example, the net longwave

77
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,180
radiation is - 150 watts per meter squared. Net radiation then

78
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,939
is just the sum of these two numbers net shortwave plus net longwave gives

79
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:12,269
us net radiation that's 650 watts per meter squared. Essentially that's

80
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:19,889
what our equation here says. The symbol we use for shortwave is shortwave (SW)

81
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:26,490
and then subscript "I" for incoming subscript "O" for outgoing. The symbol for longwave

82
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:35,820
is LW same subscript. Any ideas of what these values will look like for

83
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:50,210
the winter over snow? Everybody has the magnet but don't cheat.

84
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,480
Exactly right so you're going to get a lot greater reflectance here because

85
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,580
it's snow on the surface instead of vegetation. The albedo of snow is often

86
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,310
around 0.7 or 0.8 if the snow is kind of old and dirty or like

87
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:09,539
0.8 to even 0.9 if the snow is fresh, it's really

88
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,129
reflective. How does this one change? We know there's going to be greater

89
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:20,278
reflected radiation but how does this one change in the winter?

90
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:27,720
Yeah but you're cheating you've got the magnet. No I'm kidding. It's okay.

91
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,259
We all know that the seasons change right and the reason the seasons change

92
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,089
is because the sun angles get much lower in the winter versus summer.  This

93
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,199
number gets a lot lower just because the Sun is at a much lower angle, it's winter.

94
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:48,870
If this guy is lower, we have less overall shortwave coming in, but we have

95
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,339
a much larger reflected component because they have snow on the surface.

96
00:09:52,339 --> 00:10:01,499
What about these two how does a change in wintertime? Remember these ones are

97
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:08,610
dependent on temperatures. Exactly it's colder in the winter than it is in

98
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,289
the summer. The sky gets a little bit colder and this number gets smaller

99
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:19,019
but not a lot. The surface actually gets a lot colder so this number gets quite a

100
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:26,669
bit smaller. Now if we look at, and everybody has has the magnet, reasonable

101
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:32,849
values for the middle of the winter in the middle of the day over a

102
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,920
snow-covered surface incoming shortwave is only about 40 % of what it

103
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,958
is in the summer, 400 watts per meter squared. The reflected component is a lot

104
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:50,818
bigger because the the snow has a high albedo. Somebody that can do math in

105
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:59,000
their head what's 350 divided by 400. That's about 0.85 roughly, I think. Yeah,

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,058
0.875 is right. The albedo in this example is almost ninety percent that's

107
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:13,139
a high reflectivity then you can see the incoming longwave from the sky does go

108
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:18,058
down a little bit but not as much as the outgoing longwave from the surface.

109
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:20,969
Essentially in the wintertime the sky temperature and the surface temperature

110
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,949
are closer to the same value and they're both cold. Our net shortwave here is

111
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:32,159
positive 50 our net longwave there is negative 50 and so the net radiation is

112
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,069
actually 0 in this example. This is

113
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:48,240
true of the middle of the winter. What about at night, what happens?

114
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,389
Essentially the yellow arrows and the yellow numbers go away and we only have

115
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:59,909
longwave at night. If we only have longwave at night, that means net

116
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:06,689
radiation is a negative number at night, and that's why it cools off a lot at

117
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:13,620
night. The surface is now losing energy to the atmosphere rather than gaining

118
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,839
energy as in the day.

119
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:28,549
The reason that we are interested in measuring net radiation is it's a

120
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:34,338
major driver of surface processes. I kind of have just explained one heating and

121
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:40,070
cooling but another one is evapotranspiration. In many cases net

122
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,360
radiation is the biggest driver or the biggest contributor to

123
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,649
evapotranspiration. Vapor pressure deficit, which Bruce talked about a lot

124
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,059
this morning is another one of the major drivers of evapotranspiration.

125
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:57,679
There's lots of reasons that net radiation could be applicable especially

126
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,519
in environmental and ecological studies Here's a slide showing the

127
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,679
surface energy balance and here's a simple surface energy balance equation.

128
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:16,609
Net radiation is a major component. We won't consider the radiation terms in

129
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,209
too much detail; they were on the previous slide. You've got incoming

130
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:26,389
shortwave streams and then outgoing, the reflected shortwave stream, and longwave

131
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,649
radiation coming from clouds and sky whatever is in the sky that has a

132
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,698
temperature is going to be admitting long wave radiation towards the surface

133
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:38,539
and then plants and soil whatever's at the surface is going to be emitting

134
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:45,679
radiation back towards the sky. The G term is the soil heat flux; the

135
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,578
flux of energy into the ground. The H term is the sensible heat flux; the heat

136
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:58,729
gain or loss due to conduction convection. It usually is heat loss

137
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,860
during the day because often the surface is warmer than the air but not always

138
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,669
the surface can be colder than the air so there can be a sensible heat flux

139
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:13,219
towards the surface. Then the LE term is the latent heat loss, which is the

140
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,550
combination of evaporation and transpiration. There are other terms

141
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:23,750
like photosynthesis would be a small contributor and there can be heat

142
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,659
storage in the plants themselves typically heat storage doesn't happen in

143
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:35,639
crops but can in forests. We just defined those.

144
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,590
Here's the real point the available energy and we call the difference

145
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,720
between net radiation and soil heat flux as available energy because that's

146
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,110
everything that's available to do things like evaporate water or heat the surface

147
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,810
for example. We often find when we make measurements of all of these terms like

148
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:03,089
at eddy covariance sites for example when we can measure sensible heat flux

149
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:09,420
and latent heat flux with gas analyzers and sonic anemometers we often find that

150
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:15,179
the available energy is not balanced by the heat fluxes, at many measurements

151
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:22,500
sites.  It should be the energy coming in should equal the energy going

152
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,669
out. The the real point is net radiation measurements have to be

153
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:35,849
accurate for surface energy balance studies. O'll talk a

154
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,220
bit about net radiometers and I'll also talk a little bit about net radiation

155
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:48,600
modeling. Earlier we were talking about how many routine weather stations that we

156
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,820
have like weather networks. They're going to have a pyrometer on there to measure

157
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,310
the incoming shortwave radiation, but a lot of times they don't have any other

158
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:03,419
radiometers. When we are talking about photosynthetic radiation earlier

159
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,799
weather stations typically don't have PAR sensors on them

160
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,319
to measure the photosynthetically active radiation. They often don't have a

161
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,320
net radiometer on there to measure net radiation. You can model net

162
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,930
radiation from incoming shortwave radiation and I'll talk about that in

163
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:31,278
addition to measurements of net radiation with net radiometers.

164
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:37,159
There are four kinds of net radiometers and I'll start with the most

165
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:43,999
complex and then I'll move to the simplest. Most of the time you don't

166
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:48,980
see too many of the intermediate types of net radiometers. Usually there's four

167
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,699
component instruments, which are the most complex and they're quite common, or

168
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:57,498
there's single component instruments which are the simplest and they're quite

169
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:05,209
common. A four-component net radiometer has an individual sensor for measuring

170
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,318
the four components that we just described. You've got an upward

171
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:14,838
looking pyranometer that measures the incoming shortwave. You've got a downward

172
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:20,480
looking pyranometer that measures the reflected shortwave. You've got an upward

173
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,110
looking pyrgeometer that measures the incoming longwave. You've got a

174
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:31,219
downwards looking pyrgeometer that measures that emitted longwave.

175
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,901
Pyranometer is the name of the sensor for shortwave radiation measurements; pyrgeometer,

176
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:42,759
kind of a funny word, is the name of the sensor for measuring the

177
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:51,230
longwave radiation. They're very similar instruments. Both of them consist

178
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,720
of a thermopile detector. Bruce talked about thermopile pyranometers

179
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,640
earlier today, essentially it's a device that measures the heat difference

180
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,860
across the top surface and the bottom

181
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:16,459
surface of the plate. Then over top of the thermopile

182
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:24,048
there's a blackbody absorber. The blackbody is just used to absorb all of

183
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:31,609
the incident radiation on it. Then pyranometers have a glass dome over top of

184
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:37,879
the thermopile and blackbody detector. The reason for the glass dome is two-fold:

185
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,030
one is to give it accurate cosine or angular response, and the other is to

186
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:49,789
block all of the longwave radiation. For a pyranometer, we're only interested in

187
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:55,909
the shortwave wavelengths. The glass is only transmissive to shortwave radiation

188
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:01,759
so we have to put a glass dome over top of the blackbody so that it blocks the

189
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,259
longwave, lets the shortwave through; therefore, the blackbody will only

190
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,759
absorb the short wave and the thermopile will only measure the

191
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:15,019
shortwave radiation. The downward looking pyrometer is the same thing it's

192
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:21,710
just inverted. It is one of them that's mounted upside down. The pyrgeometer is very similar

193
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,809
the only difference is instead of having a glass dome it has a silicon dome over

194
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:32,419
top of the blackbody. I know what I've drawn here doesn't look like a dome

195
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,140
shape, sometimes the pyrgeometers will have a small dome shape other times

196
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,970
it'll just be a flat surface so it's actually a silicon window rather than a

197
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:47,480
dome. The reason that we use a silicon dome is because it blocks the shortwave

198
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,730
radiation and transmits the longwave radiation. A pyrgeometer is

199
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,120
designed to measure  longwave. We have to block the shortwave and allow only

200
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:00,529
the longwave through so that the blackbody absorber can absorb it and the

201
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:05,480
thermopile can measure it. Here again you've got one up, one down to

202
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,480
measure the short and longwave. Examples of this type of net radiometer

203
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,789
are the Hukseflux that's a Dutch company and Kipp and Zonen, also a

204
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:21,289
Dutch company. They both build four component instruments that work very

205
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:26,389
well. I'll show you some pictures in a minute. Apogee Instruments also builds

206
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,700
one. I don't really have a good demo to show you but I will pass this around so

207
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,240
you can see what an instrument actually looks like. This sensor here with the

208
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:44,180
the white diffuser on the top is the upward looking pyranometer. I know I just

209
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,480
said they typically have glass domes, this one doesn't have a glass dome it

210
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,299
has an acrylic diffuser, which is also transmissive to the shortwave wavelengths.

211
00:20:53,299 --> 00:21:01,200
The bottom pyranometer is a glass window that's this one. Then the two pyrgeometers

212
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:10,470
have black, flat black, windows that are made of silicon. They look the same up

213
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,079
and down. You're welcome to have a look.

214
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,282
Question: What is the price of these?

215
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:26,528
Mark: The Hukseflux

216
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:34,210
is probably, these numbers are going to be in US dollars I don't

217
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,690
know what they would be an Australian dollars.

218
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,308
I  gues Ican say the price. Peter is the one who sells it in Australia but the US list

219
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:36,740
price is about $2,500, but you will also have to

220
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,190
pay for importation and stuff like that. This Kipp and Zonen us is about

221
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,169
$6000 I think, maybe a little higher because it comes with a

222
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:53,900
heater and ventilator on it.  The Hukselfux  unit is closer to $5000. I think

223
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,470
it's between 4500 and 5000 US dollars that gives you an

224
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:04,190
idea of the price tag of these sensors. In a minute I will compare in a

225
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,240
relative sense, I'll compare the price of all of the above because we're going to

226
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,019
put four more or three more pictures like this one on the slide here.

227
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:24,230
The next type is a net all wave radiometer and this one is the simplest version. You

228
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:32,120
basically have one thermopile and it's sandwiched between two blackbody

229
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:39,109
absorbers, one on top and one on bottom, and there's two polyethylene domes over

230
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:47,449
top of the absorbers. What you have is a thermo-pile that's just outputting

231
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,440
a signal that's proportional to the temperature difference between the top

232
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,759
surface and the bottom surface. That temperature difference between the top

233
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,230
surface and the bottom surface is dependent on the radiation incident on

234
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,720
the top and the radiation incident on the bottom. The reason this is called a

235
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,240
net all wave radiometer is that it's measuring each surface, the upward

236
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,019
looking surface and the downward looking surface, are measuring all of the

237
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,940
wavelengths at the same time. It is sensitive to shortwave and longwave

238
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,809
together. Polyethylene actually transmits shortwave

239
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:30,359
and longwave. The reason for the polyethylene domes is just to

240
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:36,629
basically be a weather barrier and keep rain and moisture and dust and dirt off

241
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:42,960
of the blackbody surface. Not all of them have, not all of these net all wave

242
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:51,500
radiometers, have polyethylene domes. Probably the most common one at

243
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,509
least historically is this Rebs. Rebs stands for radiation and energy balance

244
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:05,129
system model Q*7.1. That's an american-made instrument from the state

245
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,240
of Washington. They were used a lot especially in past decades. Now it seems

246
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,450
like the Kipp and Zonen NR Lite 2 is the most common type of these net all

247
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:24,509
wave radiometers. The Rebs has the polyethylene domes the Kipp and Zonen

248
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:32,879
NR Lite 2 does not. The real challenge of polyethylene domes

249
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:41,280
is they are flimsy and you have to keep them pressurized often in order for

250
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:50,519
them to not collapse. At the same time polyethylene is better at transmitting

251
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,369
shortwave than it is at transmitting longwave and so when you get different

252
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:02,129
proportions of longwave and shortwave say clear sky versus cloudy sky for

253
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:08,400
example or over vegetation versus over snow it can really influence the

254
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,640
accuracy. The polyethylene domes all they can keep it clean and free of water

255
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,530
they also have their challenges. They have to be replaced quite often

256
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:26,730
because their flimsy, birds like to peck holes in them. The Kipp and Zonen

257
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,390
NR Lite in doing away with the polyethylene domes they get around at

258
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:35,899
least part of the problem of the domes but at the same time

259
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:43,099
when the surfaces get wet the radiation balance goes way out of whack and they

260
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:48,379
don't yield accurate measurements until they're dry. These ones while they're

261
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:56,960
the simplest and the cheapest also are the most prone to errors. We just talked

262
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:06,130
about prices for all of these. These guys are probably 1500 to 2000 dollars US,

263
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:14,299
somewhere in that range. I won't spend nearly as much time on these two

264
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:23,000
intermediate types just because this is the only example of this type of

265
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,490
two component instrument that I'm aware of and it's no longer available.

266
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,579
Essentially it worked a lot like this one where you have a single

267
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:39,138
thermopile that is measuring the net difference between what's coming in and

268
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:44,418
what's coming out. It's just that we separate shortwave and longwave.  We

269
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:50,330
actually have two components one of them is measuring net shortwave the other

270
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:55,369
ones measuring net longwave. This was a nice instrument when it was available

271
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:05,089
but it didn't last very long on the market. The other type is also kind of

272
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:10,038
like that one but rather than being a net device that only gives you one

273
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:15,138
signal that's proportional to the difference between all of the incoming

274
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:21,558
radiation and all of the outgoing radiation is that they separate the

275
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:26,569
pirradiometer so you've got two of them. You've got an upward looking one that's

276
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:30,859
sensitive to both the incoming shortwave and the incoming longwave, and then

277
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:36,229
a downward looking one that's sensitive to both the outgoing shortwave and the

278
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,880
outgoing longwave. So a good example of this one

279
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:50,340
is the Phillip Shane model 8111 it is a European instrument I believe it comes from

280
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:57,359
Germany maybe Switzerland, I can't remember for sure. This one is

281
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:03,359
not a very widely used instrument predominantly you'll see this or that

282
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:13,199
one. I said I had some pictures here's what they all look like the Hukseflux and

283
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,330
the Kipp and Zonen and the Apogee that I passed around the room is in the middle.

284
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:24,269
The major advantages of a four-component net radiometer is that

285
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:30,000
you get an individual measurement of each one of the four components.

286
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,259
That's a major advantage because typically that gives you higher accuracy.

287
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:41,700
I say potentially here because four individual sensors also means you've got

288
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,890
four components that might cause problems, like if one of them isn't

289
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,450
calibrated correctly that can be a problem or you've got four of them that

290
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,250
might get dirty for example. Then we already talked about price, these tend to

291
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:01,200
be higher cost. Just one design feature that I will mention with regards

292
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,809
to the Apogee is that it has an SDI-12 output. We get around this need

293
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:16,200
for all of those datalogger channels. What this means is in the center

294
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,289
box here on the Apogee unit, there's a circuit board in there; all the outputs

295
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:27,329
from the individual radiometers are being measured by the analog to digital

296
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:32,699
converter on that internal circuit board and then we're just digitizing those

297
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,910
signals and outputting an SDI-12 measurements. You can plug it

298
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:43,110
into a digital, one single digital channel, on your dataloggerr and not

299
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:46,879
have to tie up all of the analog channels to get a measurement.

300
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:55,210
If we look at the net all wave radiometers here's the two examples that

301
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:02,559
I listed in the previous slide, there's the polyethylene domes and that one is the

302
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,819
domeless model. Again these domes, they're better transmitting shortwave

303
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:14,019
than they are a longwave, which can lead to errors. They don't always stay

304
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:19,349
inflated. If they get a hole in them, they will get water condensing on the inside causes problems.

305
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:24,519
The domes need to be replaced periodically. This one because they're domeless

306
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,250
they're exposed to the environment to get wet and dirty.

307
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:36,750
The main advantages here are it only requires one datalogger channel to make

308
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:42,720
a measurment. Remember it is a single detector where the signal it is outputting is

309
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,798
proportional to the differences of everything thing that is comming in and everything that is

310
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:52,379
going out so it requires one analog measurement. These do tend to be smaller and

311
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,260
lighter weight so they can be easier to mount level. Again we already

312
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:04,490
talked about price; they tend to be lower cost. The major disadvantages

313
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,750
they have fragile domes and they're domeless. This domeless guy requires a

314
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,960
wind speed correction because if the winds blowing over top of it it can

315
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,840
change the energy balance. If you have mismatched detectors that can be a big

316
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,899
problem, essentially what that means is you only have a single sensor and you've

317
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,860
got one detector surface on the top side of that sensor or thermopile and one

318
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:35,849
detector surface on the bottom side of that thermopile. They have to have the

319
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:40,558
same sensitivity to shortwave and longwave, and they have to have the same

320
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,710
sensitivity to each other. Otherwise they're only accurate for the conditions

321
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,360
that they're calibrated to, if the conditions are changing like they do in

322
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:59,219
a dynamic environment then the mismatch detectors so the upward sensitivity

323
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,808
doesn't match the downward sensitivity can lead to errors. They tend to be

324
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:07,139
higher maintenance for example you have to replace the domes and all of the

325
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,770
above combined lead to lower accuracy. This was just a summary slide and I'll

326
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:20,150
mention that a few years ago before Apogee started building net radiometers

327
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,290
we were interested in potentially selling net radiometers from other

328
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:32,759
companies and we did a extensive field study where we compared several

329
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:39,750
different models of net radiometers for part of the growing season over a

330
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:46,798
uniform turf grass field in Logan Utah. The citation to our work is here if

331
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,579
you're interested in getting the paper again shoot me an email and I will send

332
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:56,819
you a PDF. The major findings were that the four component net radiometers

333
00:33:56,819 --> 00:34:02,548
did indeed provide the most accurate measurements but I put an if in here you

334
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:06,509
have to make sure that the radiometer is level and you want to make sure that the

335
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:13,108
individual sensors are clean. The net all wave radiometers were the simplest but

336
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:17,849
they did have lower accuracy and it was due to lower sensitivity to longwave

337
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:25,829
radiation. The last line I think is important; we found that net radiometers

338
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:31,049
were capable of measuring radiation with better accuracy than what is often reported

339
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,889
in the literature. There's quite a few studies out there like energy balance

340
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,840
studies especially at flux tower sites that indicate net radiation uncertainty is

341
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,619
like 10 or 20 %. I think if you're measuring it with a

342
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,159
four-component net radiometer that's well leveled and clean then the

343
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,429
uncertainty is probably lower than what's usually reported in the

344
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:59,579
literature for net radiation measurements. Any questions about measuring net

345
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:05,190
radiation? I'll just take a minute I don't have any slides for this but I

346
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:11,280
think I can make use of the board. I might not even need to make use of the

347
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,359
board. I think I can just explain it. Tor those of you that are interested in

348
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,650
modeling net radiation, again we can talk afterwards or you can send me a

349
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,260
follow-up email and I can give you more detail but for those cases when you

350
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:28,619
have weather data and you need net radiation but the weather data did

351
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:36,059
not include a net radiometer to measure the net radiation you can model it. The

352
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,559
most important component that you need is a measurement of the incoming

353
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,389
shortwave radiation from a pyranometer. If you're looking at your fridge magnet or

354
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:50,019
if you remember my first slide, usually the largest

355
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:54,550
component of net radiation is the incoming shortwave component from the

356
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:01,660
Sun so if you have that measurement you have at least a reasonable idea of net

357
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:06,670
radiation and you can model the other components. Typically how it's done is

358
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:14,980
then to take a published value of albedo for the surface that you're measuring.

359
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,210
If it's vegetation it's going to be pretty low around 0.2 to 0.25,

360
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:26,740
if it's snow it's going to be quite a bit higher. Published values of

361
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:34,209
albedo are fairly accurate if the surface conditions don't change

362
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:38,159
dramatically. If you're trying to do this when the vegetation is always green,

363
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:43,829
just estimating or taking a published value of the albedo and calculating the

364
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:49,809
reflected shortwave component that way works pretty well. The challenge is if

365
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:53,579
you're trying to do this over the course of say a whole year when you might have

366
00:36:53,579 --> 00:37:01,269
you know snow or bare soil in the  winter time and then the crops start to

367
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:07,179
come up and you have green vegetation and soil mixture and then the crops fill

368
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:11,589
in and you only have green vegetation for most of the growing season and

369
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:18,160
then the crops nest and they turn yellow and then you harvest them. I mean

370
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,139
the surface can be quite dynamic over the course of a whole year. You can

371
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:27,460
only use values of albedo if you know what it is for the surface or have a

372
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,599
good estimate of it and if it's not changing significantly. If the

373
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,360
surface is changing a lot then you have to change the albedo in your model.

374
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,690
Tthe way that longwave is often estimated is from measurements of air

375
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:51,970
temperature and relative humidity and then we we can predict longwave pretty

376
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:58,629
well from equations like this. This is the Stefan Boltzmann equation and emitted

377
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:03,340
energy is proportional to a constant times the fourth power of

378
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:10,059
temperature. If we know reasonably well what the the fourth

379
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:17,110
power of temperature is for the surface, then we can estimate a longwave

380
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,910
relatively well, the components being emitted because we know that most

381
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:28,029
surfaces are blackbodies, most land surfaces are blackbodies. If we are working

382
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:38,769
with plant canopies or soil or snow, the emissivity right there in the equation

383
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:43,570
this number is going to be close to one. If we have a reasonable estimate of

384
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,160
the surface temperature, we can estimate the emitted longwave components so the

385
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,049
part that's going from the ground to the atmosphere from this equation. To

386
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:58,090
estimate the incoming longwave component we use the exact same equation

387
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:03,460
and oftentimes we use the air temperature as a proxy for

388
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,460
the sky temperature. The challenge with doing incoming longwave radiation

389
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,780
estimates is this number is the hard one and you were asking about that earlier.

390
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:19,870
There are ways to estimate the emissivity for the atmosphere and that's

391
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:26,199
where the humidity measurement comes in. It's usually empirical equations that

392
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:30,939
estimate atmospheric emissivity based on sometimes  theare temperature but

393
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:37,720
typically the vapor pressure of the atmosphere. The error can be

394
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:43,599
kind of high because atmospheric emissivity is not always that dependent

395
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,940
on the vapor pressure near the surface. The vapor pressure that we

396
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,450
measure at the surface typically comes from a relative humidity probe that

397
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:58,239
might be two meters off the ground but the longwave radiation coming from the

398
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,369
sky is coming from the whole depth of atmosphere from two meters above the

399
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:09,279
ground till way up in the atmosphere. If the near-surface vapor pressure is a

400
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,869
reasonable tstament of the whole column of water in the atmosphere, then

401
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:18,740
empirically estimating atmospheric emissivity from near surface vapor

402
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:24,078
pressure works okay. If the near-surface vapor pressure is not a good estimator

403
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,480
of the whole column of water in the atmosphere, then the empirical equations

404
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:36,170
don't work that well. There are ways to model net radiation if it's not

405
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,240
available, but I would recommend measuring it if you have the equipment

406
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:48,618
to do so. Iif you're interested in learning more about how to model

407
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:52,430
net radiation please send me an email I can help with that. There's quite a bit

408
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:56,779
of information in the literature that's been published. There's a really good

409
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:07,819
study from about 2007 I think, maybe 2009, where some folks at USDA in the United

410
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:13,449
States compared a whole bunch of different incoming longwave radiation

411
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:23,389
models and assessed the accuracy relative to measurements. Any questions? I believe

412
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:28,710
that's all I have for net radiation.
