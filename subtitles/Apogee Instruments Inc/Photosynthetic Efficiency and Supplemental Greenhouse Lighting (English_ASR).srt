1
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:07,809
we teach all our students hybrid vigor

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,750
and this if this was some kind of

3
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:13,179
comprehensive exam we would ask you to

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,240
define exactly what it is that's hybrid

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:19,750
vigor and we like to think that by

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:22,209
merging plants and soils and climate we

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,210
get hybrid vigor in our department and

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,550
as you learn in plant science 101 that

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:31,118
is hybrid vigor is just diversity of

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,698
genes mixed all together where the

11
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,738
outcome is better than you would ever

12
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:40,238
expect from the sum of the component

13
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:43,299
parts and with that idea we are

14
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,698
fortunate to have funds for invited

15
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:48,009
speakers in our department and when they

16
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:52,048
come from another place they bring us

17
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:55,178
hybrid vigor and insights to things that

18
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:55,888
we might not have come up with by

19
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,579
ourselves

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:05,379
so today we are honored to have mark van

21
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:08,200
ear sole talk about his work he was at

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,000
that University and the Netherlands that

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:17,049
people spend their whole careers trying

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,989
to pronounce the University tonight vaga

25
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:22,719
ningÃºn and that was the subject of a

26
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:27,159
National Geographic cover story I think

27
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:30,579
not long ago the Netherlands feed the

28
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:36,489
world and Mark is a product of that

29
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:38,769
University he came here for PhD with a

30
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:42,280
guy named Eric rooster house who was a

31
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:45,549
personal friend of mine and he did such

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,650
an outstanding job that we were able to

33
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:52,420
get him here as a postdoc and it's about

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,180
18 years ago or something a long time

35
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,189
ago and he then went to the University

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,340
of Georgia and he recently got an

37
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:04,539
endowed chair at Georgia which gives him

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,390
more money to work with he's brought a

39
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,359
lot of diverse expertise to the study of

40
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,128
plant physiology and particularly plant

41
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:16,030
physiology and controlled environments

42
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:18,280
using them to study

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,610
things that are much broader than the

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,530
controlled environment themselves so you

45
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,050
can see what he's gonna talk to us about

46
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,550
today

47
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:32,010
professor hips is pretty excited to hear

48
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:37,980
about cannabis research with this then

49
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:42,359
so please welcome mark the nurse'll

50
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:45,039
[Applause]

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,840
thank you Bruce and I'll pleb on this

52
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,519
mic and so Bruce talks about hybrid Vega

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,099
I might refer to it slightly as

54
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,129
inbreeding given that I'm coming back to

55
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:59,169
the University where I did my postdoc I

56
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,449
had a great time here slightly longer

57
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:04,000
than 18 years ago and I my former PhD

58
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:07,599
student Shu young in the back is the new

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,568
postdoc in Bruce's lab so more not so

60
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:15,789
much hybrid vigorous not just selecting

61
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:17,229
elite lines at this point so I've worked

62
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:19,949
in controlled environment agriculture

63
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:22,509
for a long time and really focus now on

64
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,039
specifically lighting and controlled

65
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,500
environment agriculture is a vague term

66
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:30,429
so when I talk about that I'm basically

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,810
talking about greenhouses and vertical

68
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,700
farms and when I started on this project

69
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,670
about five years ago I was initially

70
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:42,369
really focused more on vertical farms

71
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:46,149
than on greenhouses because in vertical

72
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,219
farms all of the light that you need to

73
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,219
grow your crop has to be provided from

74
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,930
some kind of an electrical light and why

75
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,709
does that matter why is that such a big

76
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,230
deal well and this is a really dense

77
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,989
engineering report developed by the

78
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:05,018
German Aerospace Center and so they did

79
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,709
a hypothetical design of what it would

80
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:13,090
take to build a massive vertical farm 37

81
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:15,400
floors high and probably given that a

82
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,310
determine engineer sway over engineered

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,530
in many aspects but it would probably

84
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,199
run flawlessly they didn't get the money

85
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,119
to actually build this but they looked

86
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,310
at what it would take to build this land

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,500
they looked at construction cost as well

88
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,000
as operating cost and when they did

89
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,500
analysis of what it would take to

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,949
operate this it turned out that power to

91
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,490
run this building was 60% of annual cost

92
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:44,909
and of that power about half of that so

93
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:49,600
30% of the overall operating cost is

94
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,820
needed to just run the lights those

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,950
lights are going to produce heat and so

96
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,050
the over 30% is pretty much all air

97
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,569
conditioning and that air conditioning

98
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,660
is needed to remove the heat that you

99
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,939
get from the lights and it is needed to

100
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,980
remove water vapor from the air because

101
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:09,819
all of these plants are producing water

102
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:12,250
so it's a massive amount of money so can

103
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:16,509
we reduce how much energy it actually

104
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:19,300
takes to grow these plants but as I was

105
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,430
thinking about this more and more I came

106
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,829
to realize greenhouses are actually a

107
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,650
much more interesting of challenging

108
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:29,620
system to burger Bergin so this is a

109
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:31,810
greenhouse just outside of Charlotte

110
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,639
North Carolina and look at the light

111
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,300
environment that these plants are

112
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:40,360
growing under it's a mess right so how

113
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,040
do you manage light in a greenhouse well

114
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,710
things are constantly changing they are

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,770
spatially clearly highly variable in

116
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:49,418
this case largely because of the very

117
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:51,939
large amount of hanging baskets that are

118
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:54,189
growing but so it's actually much more

119
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,728
complicated to manage lighting in

120
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:59,050
greenhouse compared to a vertical form

121
00:05:56,728 --> 00:06:01,779
any greenhouse you obviously have

122
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,259
temporal variability to so this is just

123
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:08,319
light data from one day in the winter in

124
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,019
our greenhouse and even on a sunny day

125
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,939
like we have here at some point during

126
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:15,159
the day like here and here

127
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,350
you got shading just from the overhead

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,340
structure of your greenhouse so things

129
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:23,290
are highly dynamic in a greenhouse which

130
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,560
makes it really different from vertical

131
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,810
forms and so in the greenhouse industry

132
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,639
we typically just integrate the total

133
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,530
amount of light that you get over the

134
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,050
course of a day we call that the daily

135
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:37,409
light integral and so for growing

136
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,879
different crops we typically make

137
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:43,129
recommendations that are based on the

138
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:49,368
daily light integral this crop needs a

139
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:52,639
integral of Y and so this is 14 years

140
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:55,269
worth of data from Canal University

141
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,848
where a monitor daily line integral

142
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:01,278
every single day and you can see that

143
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:04,158
recessional differences in daily line

144
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:06,918
integral but even in the middle of

145
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:10,368
summer in Canal you can have a daily

146
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,769
light integral as low as maybe six moles

147
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:16,069
per square meter per day and this high

148
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:18,918
as 70 most the square meter per day so

149
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:21,319
again lots of variability so how do you

150
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:22,848
manage that how do you grow a crop when

151
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,968
you don't know what the light is going

152
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:28,668
to be and so can now focus a lot on

153
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:30,860
lettuce research for many years they've

154
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:33,408
worked on that and after years of

155
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,269
studies what they found out is that the

156
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:39,918
one cultivar of lettuce that I actually

157
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:42,949
studied it does best if you give it a

158
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,959
daily line integral of 717 Moore's

159
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:48,079
prescribed meter per day and what that

160
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,649
means is that for every dot that you see

161
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:54,110
below this red line you need to provide

162
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:56,658
supplemental lighting anytime you get

163
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,939
above that red line you need to provide

164
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:01,069
shading and I'm not that interested in

165
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,838
shading I'm more interested in the

166
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,399
lighting part which you can see on how

167
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:06,678
many days you actually would need to

168
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,550
provide supplemental light to reach that

169
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:13,098
target of 17 moles so why does this

170
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,309
matter in the greenhouse industry so if

171
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:17,959
you look at a typical greenhouse that is

172
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:21,439
using supplemental lighting they might

173
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,689
have 500 400 watt high pressure sodium

174
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,959
lights per hectare of greenhouse and

175
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,399
they may run them for 14 hours a day

176
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:31,939
let's just assume that they paid 10

177
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,009
cents a kilowatt hour it turns out that

178
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,589
they pay two hundred and eighty dollars

179
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:39,438
per hectare for they just an electricity

180
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:42,969
to run their lights now if they run the

181
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:47,028
lights for half the year they spent

182
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:50,509
$50,000 per hectare just on electricity

183
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:52,458
so that's a good amount of money then in

184
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,350
a recent Department of Energy report

185
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:56,299
they estimated the total cost of

186
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,009
providing lighting in controlled

187
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,799
environment

188
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:02,590
culture and that 600 million dollars a

189
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,259
year in the United States so that's a

190
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,180
lot of money if we can reduce that by 10

191
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:12,009
percent that's 60 million dollars right

192
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:14,500
that's almost real money so this is a

193
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,809
map that shows the daily lighter

194
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,090
integral in different parts of the

195
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,599
United States and different times of the

196
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,730
year

197
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,120
developed by Jim fast it was now at

198
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,340
Clemson University not surprisingly you

199
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,340
have big changes over the course of the

200
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,399
year and how much light you can expect

201
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,250
to get and this map was initially

202
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,019
developed to try to get some idea of how

203
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,549
much of what crops cook can you grow

204
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,860
where what time of the year

205
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:44,889
how much supplemental light might you

206
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,649
need to provide but this makes it spell

207
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,299
pretty difficult to actually figure out

208
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:52,779
for a particular crop how much light do

209
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:56,139
I need to get in addition to sunlight so

210
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:58,120
in the last two months I worked with two

211
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,970
colleagues at Cornell to develop a

212
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,389
different kind of a map and so what we

213
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,759
did let's let's assume that we are going

214
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,059
to grow lettuce and we want to make sure

215
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:12,970
that every single day of the year we

216
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:16,509
have a daily line integral of 17 moles

217
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,790
of photons per square meter per day we

218
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:21,340
have a supplemental lighting system that

219
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:23,529
can provide an instantaneous for the

220
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,170
synthetic photon flux of 200 micro moles

221
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:29,809
per square meter per second and so using

222
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:34,879
typical weather data from around the U

223
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:37,699
as we calculated the number of hours on

224
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,490
the y-axis here of supplemental light

225
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,830
that you need to provide to grow in this

226
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,019
example lattice and we can easily run

227
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:49,190
this for for whatever crop you're

228
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,990
interested in and not surprisingly in

229
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,160
the southwest you don't need a lot of

230
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,639
supplemental light

231
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,769
likewise in florid I'm not much but

232
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,299
there are big differences in how much

233
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,490
light you need in different parts of the

234
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:04,459
country and it makes it difficult to

235
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,639
come up with general guidelines for is

236
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,129
it actually cost-effective to install a

237
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,809
supplemental lighting system so along

238
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,919
with an agricultural economist at the

239
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:18,199
University of Georgia we try to estimate

240
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:20,299
the return on investment of installing a

241
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,420
lighting system and we did that for two

242
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:27,109
locations so we use Athens Georgia

243
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:29,028
because that's where we live and then we

244
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,460
use Seattle Washington and you can

245
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:33,620
probably guess why we picked Seattle as

246
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,470
the other place it is

247
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,419
well if supplemental lighting is going

248
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,790
to pay anywhere it is probably going to

249
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:44,269
be in Seattle and they don't get much

250
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:46,009
light so in Seattle if you provide

251
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,230
supplemental lighting to lettuce you can

252
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:52,250
expect to get an additional five point

253
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,860
three crops a year by by providing that

254
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,559
light and on a per hectare basis that

255
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,930
means and that you are going to gross

256
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:04,129
two hundred and eighty three thousand

257
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:06,620
dollars per year extra now of course the

258
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:08,299
lighting isn't free so it will take you

259
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,370
about two hundred and twenty thousand

260
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,870
dollars per hectare per year to actually

261
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,539
pay for the lighting and that includes

262
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:18,289
both installation and operating cost of

263
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:19,939
the lighting system but so net you have

264
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:22,250
an additional sixty three thousand

265
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,830
dollars per hectare per year and profits

266
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,500
so that's a pretty nice amount so in the

267
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,080
place like Seattle yes this is probably

268
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,639
going to be a really good investment

269
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,278
when you look at Georgia Athens Georgia

270
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,639
the situation is different so you may

271
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,169
get two point three extra crops a year

272
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,600
which grosses you another one hundred

273
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:42,860
and twenty three thousand dollars but

274
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,620
it's going to cost one hundred and

275
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,339
twenty thousand

276
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,080
dollars so you might expect $3,000 an

277
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,690
extra profit from installing a lighting

278
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,940
system and that is probably not going to

279
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,380
be worth the investment and so what we

280
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,330
are really interested in is trying to

281
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:00,509
help growers make these decisions based

282
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,370
on the local climatic conditions of

283
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:04,830
whether one or the discussed effective

284
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:09,330
for them to actually install that

285
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:11,250
lighting but so I'm a physiologist not

286
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,830
an economist I know nothing about

287
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,190
economics other than that I know that

288
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:19,889
growers make decisions based on expected

289
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,140
return on investment but so my part of

290
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,909
this is to try to make sure that we

291
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,980
provide supplemental lighting in the

292
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:30,360
most efficient way that we can and so

293
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,920
then we start out with a simple question

294
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,889
how do we actually quantify how

295
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,979
efficiently light is being used and so

296
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:40,620
for that well hopefully we all know that

297
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,278
plants need light for photosynthesis and

298
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,799
it's not exactly new so we have just a

299
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,750
very simplistic diagram where we have

300
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,439
sunlight providing life for the light

301
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,720
reactions creating ATP and nadph the

302
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,720
Calvin cycle then uses that ATP and

303
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,910
NADPH to fix co2 to make carbohydrates

304
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,519
which the plant can then use for growth

305
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:07,860
and maintenance processes so initially

306
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,100
the light is used right here in the

307
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,990
light reactions of photosynthesis so if

308
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,540
we really want to study that a

309
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,870
physiological level how efficiently

310
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:22,708
plants use light then this may be a good

311
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,620
starting point and so when light reaches

312
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:27,778
the chloroplast it is absorbed by

313
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,120
pigment molecules it bounces from one

314
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,458
pigment molecule the energy ultimately

315
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,700
is funneled towards the reaction center

316
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,919
where that light energy is used to

317
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,950
transfer an electron you're essentially

318
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,849
creating a current from light energy and

319
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,740
so this diagram shows the entire light

320
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,920
reactions of photosynthesis where we

321
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,360
have a pretty happy Sun on the top left

322
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,870
and it's going to provide us with a

323
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,870
photon

324
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:01,149
there it goes and with the energy from

325
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:02,740
that photon an electron from water

326
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,699
starts moving through the electron

327
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,830
transport chain

328
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,629
they've spots right here because that's

329
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,100
the rate limiting step in the whole

330
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:12,730
process of the light reactions of

331
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,649
photosynthesis and so as long as this

332
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,649
electron is right here inside of

333
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:20,230
photosystem 2 for the system to cannot

334
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,909
accept additional light energy so if

335
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,730
there is an order photon that now gets

336
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:28,779
towards photosystem 2 for the system to

337
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,639
cannot use it from there the electron

338
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,069
moves on and with the help of a second

339
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,250
photon ultimately the electron goes to

340
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,830
NADPH so we are really interested in

341
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,590
this process right here in photosystem 2

342
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:46,000
and how efficiently photosystem 2 is

343
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:49,330
using light energy to move electrons so

344
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,720
not all of the light that reaches leaves

345
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:55,870
is actually used for for the chemistry

346
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,269
or electron transport a lot of the light

347
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:01,480
energy is actually just converted into

348
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,189
heat and essentially lost that actually

349
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,710
is something that is actively controlled

350
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,930
by plants and a pretty crucial way for

351
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,330
plants to dissipate excess light energy

352
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:13,629
and then a very small one to two percent

353
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,670
of the absorbed photons are actually

354
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,759
re-emitted in the form of chlorophyll

355
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:21,309
fluorescence so a plant that you see

356
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,960
anywhere if it is getting light it is

357
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:25,119
actually giving off light as well you

358
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,210
can't see it because it is so little

359
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,549
light so it's if you have a green laser

360
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,580
pointer and you shine it on a leaf you

361
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,589
can actually see a red glow coming from

362
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,889
the leaf it's pretty neat we're going to

363
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,509
see that so it turns out that

364
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,899
chlorophyll fluorescence is something

365
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:48,669
that is really easy to measure you just

366
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:50,769
clamp the sensor here on a leaf of sweet

367
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:52,959
potato right here and you can measure

368
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,340
how much fluorescence is coming from

369
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,950
that leave and I'm not going to go

370
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,320
through the theory behind fluorescence

371
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,820
but you can calculate lots of things

372
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,290
from chlorophyll fluorescence

373
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,549
measurements and one thing that you can

374
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:08,680
calculate as the dark adapted or maximum

375
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:11,319
quantum efficiency of

376
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,529
system - so you do that in plants that

377
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,450
have been in the dark for fifteen to

378
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:17,710
thirty minutes you can take a

379
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,480
measurement and it gives you an

380
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,430
indication whether or not for the system

381
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,460
- its healthy if for the system - is

382
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:26,740
damaged that maximum quantum efficiency

383
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,380
the photosystem two decreases and it

384
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,440
indicates that the plans are some kind

385
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,780
of stress what is more interesting is

386
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,330
that you can also measure the intrinsic

387
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:40,000
quantum efficiency in the light how

388
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:43,000
efficiently is that leaf using the light

389
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,970
that it is absorbing and so from that we

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,009
calculate something that we call Phi ps2

391
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,799
or the quantum yield a photosystem two

392
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:53,769
and it is the fraction of absorbed light

393
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,149
that is used for photo chemistry and so

394
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:57,430
when you think about supplemental

395
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,740
lighting we would of course like that to

396
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,470
be high we want plants to use the light

397
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,500
that we give them to use that light for

398
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,809
photo chemistry if we measure the

399
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,029
quantum yield of photosystem two we can

400
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:12,849
actually calculate the rate of electron

401
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:14,710
transport through photosystem two using

402
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:17,469
a pretty simple equation we look at the

403
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,420
efficiency of photosystem two we

404
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,150
multiply that by the amount of light

405
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,730
that is absorbed by the leaf and we

406
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,410
assume typically that leaves absorb

407
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,900
about eighty four percent of the light

408
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,480
that hits them and then we divide that

409
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,340
by two because we need two photons to

410
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,309
move one electron all the way from water

411
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:38,289
ultimately to NADPH so we can calculate

412
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:42,099
the electron transport rate pretty

413
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:45,430
easily and so my graduate student Jeff

414
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:47,829
Weaver did a relatively simple but

415
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:50,500
pretty interesting study well about two

416
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:52,720
years ago now well he just monitored the

417
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,730
photochemical efficiency of ladders

418
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,059
grown in the greenhouse so for 30 days

419
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:02,589
he was growing lettuce from seedlings to

420
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:04,389
full-size plants and every 15 minutes he

421
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:06,309
measured the quantum yield of

422
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:09,550
photosystem 2 calculated the electron

423
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:11,319
transport from that and so when he took

424
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:15,099
all of those data points plotted them

425
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:17,769
together we see that with an increasing

426
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:20,529
photosynthetic photon flux the quantum

427
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,309
yield of photosystem 2 decreases so the

428
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,410
more light you give a plant the

429
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,240
as efficiently it's being used there's

430
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,580
nothing new about this this is well

431
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,890
known I think we may be the first ones

432
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:33,949
who have monitored this over such a long

433
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:37,850
period so frequently this is not really

434
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,440
what we were after but an important

435
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:41,209
take-home message here is that the more

436
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,970
light a plant gets the less efficiently

437
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,130
it uses that light we can use these data

438
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,220
to calculate the electron transport rate

439
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,350
and we see an asymptotic increase in

440
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,309
electron transport rate with an increase

441
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:58,669
in photosynthetic photon flux with an

442
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:00,529
asymptote of about 130 micro moles of

443
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,039
electrons per square meter per second

444
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:06,230
and overall I'm actually surprised that

445
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,180
every day we measured a different plant

446
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,920
that when we measure all of these

447
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:14,360
different plans it still follows that

448
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,490
overall trend pretty nicely so what we

449
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,789
were really interested in was death

450
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:22,250
graph so on the y-axis we have the daily

451
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:24,619
photochemical integral that's a term

452
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,589
you've never heard of because we made it

453
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:29,479
up but what we did very similar to the

454
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:32,089
daily lighter integral is over the

455
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,670
course of an entire day we integrated

456
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:36,859
all of the electron transport rates to

457
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,170
get to this daily photochemical integral

458
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:43,039
how many electrons are moved through

459
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:45,259
photosystem 2 in one single day and then

460
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,710
we plotted that against the daily light

461
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:50,960
integral and once again we get this

462
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,900
asymptotic increase and daily for the

463
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,779
chemical integral with an increase in

464
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,430
daily light integral and what was

465
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:02,029
interesting when we looked at these data

466
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:05,330
is that when we look at 90% of the

467
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:08,359
asymptote which is about 3 moles of

468
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:12,220
electron transport per day and we look

469
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,219
at the daily light integral that we need

470
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:19,730
Gladys we get a daily light integral of

471
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:23,619
18 moles per square meter per day so

472
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:26,960
that's took us 30 days to do come Nell

473
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:29,928
using four or five years of data on

474
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,538
growing lettuce drew the conclusion that

475
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,280
for lettuce you need 17 moles per square

476
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:36,048
meter per day so pretty much the same

477
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:39,859
light level so this correlates really

478
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:43,058
well with what canal fund so we think

479
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:45,979
that a daily photochemical integral of

480
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:50,058
three is a really good target for

481
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:53,120
growing lettuce plants and different

482
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:55,720
crops are differently so we did similar

483
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,158
studies using impatience which is a

484
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,980
plant that typically grows in the shade

485
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,580
and so you see the same general decrease

486
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,710
right here with increasing

487
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:08,808
photosynthetic photon flux and then we

488
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,200
did geraniums which is a high light plan

489
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:14,029
that you can see that with geraniums the

490
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,980
quantum efficiency or quantum yield the

491
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:18,649
photosystem 2 is much higher it has a

492
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,690
plant that is adapted to hide light

493
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,780
levels and it can use like more

494
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,990
efficiently in itself not that shocking

495
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:28,730
when we use the same data to calculate

496
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,029
the electron transport rates you see

497
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,890
that the Sun adapted geraniums can

498
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:37,069
achieve much higher electron transport

499
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,870
rates than the shade species impatience

500
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:41,928
so it's just important to keep in mind

501
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:44,689
that draw big differences among species

502
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,788
this also has some interesting

503
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,429
implications for how you're going to

504
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:52,308
manage supplemental lighting so let's

505
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,650
say you're a grower and you have lights

506
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:57,408
and you want to make sure that the light

507
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,600
that you provide to your crop is going

508
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:04,000
to use it's going to be used with at

509
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:07,158
least a 60% efficiency well for

510
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,909
impatience that efficiency drops below

511
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,919
60% at a light level of about 150

512
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:17,750
microvolts per square meter per level a

513
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:22,820
per second for geranium that efficiency

514
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:26,690
doesn't drop below 60% or 0.6 till you

515
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,990
get to a light level of about 530 micro

516
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,090
most

517
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,940
square meter per second so that means

518
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,990
that you're white might want to manage

519
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,420
supplemental lighting for these two

520
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:40,160
different species very differently based

521
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:43,340
on the physiology of those plants to

522
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,740
show it at a different way for

523
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,720
impatience you wouldn't want to provide

524
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,240
more supplemental light than to reach

525
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,120
this level right here 150 micro moles

526
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,670
per square meter per day well for

527
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,129
geranium you can go up to much higher

528
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,650
light levels and the geraniums can still

529
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,090
use that light that you're giving them

530
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:06,950
efficiently for the light reactions of

531
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:09,019
photosynthesis so in conclusion for this

532
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,860
part there are big differences among

533
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:14,329
species so you should take that into

534
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,759
account when you develop lighting

535
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:18,769
strategies but the main take-home

536
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,589
message that I want you to remember is

537
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:24,558
that light is used most efficiently when

538
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:25,789
PPF or light intensity is low and that

539
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,558
means that you want to provide your

540
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:30,109
supplemental lighting when there is

541
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:33,230
little ambient light available and to

542
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:35,178
illustrate that so this is a light

543
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,000
response curve for electron transport

544
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:40,220
grade of lattice and so if you add 200

545
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,109
micro moles of supplemental light the

546
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,269
lattice plans that are in the dark right

547
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:46,279
here you can increase the electron

548
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:49,129
transport rate by about 60 micro moles

549
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,619
per square meter per second if you have

550
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,510
200 micro moles of sunlight and you add

551
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:57,079
200 micro moles of supplemental light

552
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:58,940
you only get an additional 40 micro

553
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,649
moles per square meter per second of

554
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,330
additional electron transport for the

555
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,400
same amount of light that you're giving

556
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:07,220
and the higher the ambient light level

557
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,390
is less efficiently the crop is going to

558
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,579
be able to use that and so because we

559
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,880
know that plants use light more

560
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:19,399
efficiently when you provide it at low

561
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,160
light levels we wanted to look at the

562
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,890
effect of photo period on electron

563
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,040
transport and lattice so Claudia Elkins

564
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:30,770
a new master student in my lab just

565
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:34,670
finished up a study where what she did

566
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:36,589
was she provided a certain total amount

567
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,230
of light at certain daily light integral

568
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:40,459
over a range of different photo periods

569
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,099
ranging from

570
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,870
seven to twenty two hours and she tested

571
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:48,909
this with two daily light integrals of

572
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:51,919
15 and 20 moles per square meter per day

573
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:56,029
so this was known in growth chambers

574
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,730
there is a picture in a minute but we

575
00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:00,139
had a data logger that made sure that we

576
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,599
maintained the light level at a

577
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:06,680
perfectly stable level over the entire

578
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,819
photo period and then Gloria collected

579
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,670
chlorophyll fluorescence measurements

580
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:13,339
every 15 minutes over the entire photo

581
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,810
period so this is an example of what

582
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,909
that looked like inside of the growth

583
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:20,899
chamber with the sensing out of the

584
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:23,180
chlorophyll for Amida right here and so

585
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,050
when you look at one day worth of data

586
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,570
there is average for a few replications

587
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:30,649
it looks something like this where

588
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:32,509
typically early in the day when the

589
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,180
lights just come on the electron

590
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:38,569
transport rate tends to be pretty low

591
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:42,080
and then it reaches a steady level after

592
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:43,730
about 20 minutes or so and there was

593
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,740
actually not a whole lot of change after

594
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,720
that it becomes pretty boring when you

595
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,490
measure this for hours in a row and the

596
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,220
values come out the same every single

597
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,349
time so with these data and what we

598
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,860
could do then once again is calculated

599
00:26:54,349 --> 00:27:00,889
daily for the chemical integral the area

600
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:03,109
underneath this curve as well but when

601
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,360
we look at them instantaneous quantum

602
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:08,419
yield and this is actually averaged over

603
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,479
the entire photo period and we plot that

604
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,160
against the photosynthetic photon flux

605
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,220
we see once again just like in the green

606
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,070
eyes that we get a decrease in the

607
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,140
quantum yield of photosystem ii with

608
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:24,169
higher light levels and so higher light

609
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,180
levels are associated with shorter photo

610
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,980
periods because we had less time to

611
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,990
provide these plants with the same

612
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,210
amount of light and they don't matter

613
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,220
for this relationship right here

614
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,870
if the daily light integral that we

615
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,839
achieved over the entire photo period

616
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:42,500
was 15 or 20 moles per square meter per

617
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:46,579
day really big change here in quantum

618
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,559
yield from about 0.68 to about 0.28 at

619
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:50,809
high light levels so life had a

620
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,289
tremendous effect on the quantity of the

621
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:58,879
photosystem 2 and so much less efficient

622
00:27:54,289 --> 00:28:00,859
at higher light levels and so we

623
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,480
calculated electron transport rates and

624
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,519
just like we saw in the greenhouse we

625
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,980
got this asymptotic increase in electron

626
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,889
transport rate with increasing

627
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,289
photosynthetic photon flux but what

628
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,300
we've more were more interested in than

629
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:16,909
the instantaneous values of quantum

630
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:19,159
yield or electron transport is how do

631
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,110
these treatments affect the daily

632
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,540
photochemical integral how much total

633
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:26,449
electron transport can we get with a

634
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:29,359
certain amount of of light that we

635
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,250
provide them so here we have the daily

636
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,559
for the chemical integral as a function

637
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,269
of photo period and so you can think of

638
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,389
for the period here as we go towards

639
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:41,000
longer photo periods the instantaneous

640
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:43,220
light level is lower right so all of

641
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,380
these treatments over the course of the

642
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,470
photo period got the same amount of

643
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:51,260
light and DLI of 15 and keep in mind

644
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,600
this is what we use in the greenhouse

645
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:56,000
industry to make recommendations for

646
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,709
light levels how much light a crop needs

647
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,769
when we look at the daily for the

648
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:04,309
chemical integral it goes from about 2.6

649
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:08,299
to maybe 5.2 with the same amount of

650
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:10,639
light we get about twice as much

651
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:14,210
electron transport if we provide that

652
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,920
light over a longer period so what that

653
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,140
means is that not all photons are the

654
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,820
same the longer periods you spread those

655
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,530
photons out over the more efficiently

656
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:23,059
the plants news lit and the more

657
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:25,490
electron transport you get and

658
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:27,019
presumably the more for the synthesis

659
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,170
and the more growth you can get out of

660
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:32,059
that and the daily light integral of 20

661
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:35,240
moles per square meter per day the

662
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,879
effect was even more pronounced so the

663
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,759
plants have much more electron transport

664
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:47,480
with longer photo periods without giving

665
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:49,970
a more light so the question after we

666
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,799
found this is this is actually matter

667
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,289
from a practical perspective do you get

668
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:56,930
better growth if you provide the same

669
00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:00,079
amount of light over a longer photo

670
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,759
period because ultimately the growers

671
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,740
that I work with don't seem to care very

672
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,470
much about electron transport through

673
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,069
photosystem 2 I try to avoid that term

674
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,380
and I talk to them

675
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:12,809
they want to see what impact that has on

676
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:17,910
growth so in order new graduate student

677
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:21,179
in my lab Shane Palmer he just finished

678
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:23,790
up a study looking at the effects of

679
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,160
photo period on the growth and some

680
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:29,700
physiology of leafy greens produced

681
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:33,120
inside of a vertical farm like system

682
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,630
and so his basic hypothesis was that

683
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,369
longer photo periods where the lower

684
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,700
photosynthetic photon flux will result

685
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,689
in more biomass faster growth than

686
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,850
shorter photo periods with high

687
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,279
photosynthetic photon flux because

688
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:52,289
plants can use lower light levels more

689
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:54,420
efficiently so he worked with mizuna

690
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:57,200
which is a Brassica is an interesting

691
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:00,900
plan because it grows unbelievably fast

692
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,360
and he suggested that that we use that

693
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,960
crop it worked previously at Kennedy

694
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,849
Space Center growing mizuna and then we

695
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,279
have lettuce here he also worked with

696
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:13,679
basil but we don't have those data yet

697
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,539
but we grew to his inside of a

698
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,980
controlled environment chamber walk-in

699
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:23,069
chamber 20 degrees C co2 enrichment we

700
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,230
used white LEDs and all plants received

701
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:28,589
a daily light integral of 16 moles per

702
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,329
square meter per day but provided over 6

703
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:34,139
different photo periods ranging from 10

704
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:36,449
to 20 hours and so to summarize the

705
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,150
treatments so we have the photo periods

706
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,799
here so we go from 10 to 20 hours and

707
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,660
that meant that the photon

708
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,980
photosynthetic photon flux range from

709
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:49,830
220 to 444 micromoles per square meter

710
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:54,140
per day per second to make sure that all

711
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:54,139
of these plants received the same

712
00:31:54,269 --> 00:32:00,750
mount of light and this graph doesn't

713
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,058
look very good but I haven't had a

714
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,619
chance yet to get my hands on the raw

715
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:08,069
data but the measured light and

716
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:10,229
perception by the mizuna over the course

717
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:11,759
of this study and I just want to draw

718
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,980
your attention to the middle part of

719
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,910
this graph where you can see right here

720
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,250
this teal greenish colored line are the

721
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:23,519
plants grown under the longest photo

722
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:26,220
period and the red and blue right here

723
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,250
are the plants grown in the two shortest

724
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,039
photo period so we saw halfway through

725
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,259
the study that the plants grown and the

726
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:38,549
longer photo periods were intercepting

727
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:40,230
more of the light and that may suggest

728
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:41,730
that the plants were bigger it was also

729
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,890
interesting to see that the morphology

730
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,349
of the plants was really different

731
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,030
depending on the photo period because

732
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:50,759
the plants that were grown in the long

733
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:52,740
photo period and low instantaneous light

734
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,230
levels they were spreading the leaves

735
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,480
out and they look like solar panels that

736
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:01,470
were deployed to try to capture as much

737
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,990
light as possible well the plans that

738
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,240
were grown with the short photo periods

739
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,549
and high instantaneous light level they

740
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,220
were like this they didn't want light

741
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:13,109
they did seem to be avoiding light and

742
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,640
that's not just reflected in the

743
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:16,500
morphology of the plants when we looked

744
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,780
at chlorophyll levels in this plant and

745
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,000
we just used the non-destructive meter

746
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:23,069
we didn't do a true quantification but

747
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,089
we have the chlorophyll content index as

748
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:28,678
a function of photo period so the plants

749
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,779
grown with short for the period

750
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:34,410
highlight intensity at much less

751
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:36,389
chlorophyll then plants grown with long

752
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,179
photo periods low light intensity so

753
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,850
that's consistent with the idea that

754
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:45,890
these plants were trying to capture as

755
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:49,649
much light energy as they possibly could

756
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:53,309
and then we measured the quantum yield

757
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,110
of photosystem 2 and we see that with

758
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:57,149
high light intensity short for the

759
00:33:55,109 --> 00:34:00,509
period the quantum yield is

760
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:04,740
significantly lower than it is with long

761
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:06,539
photo periods and low light intensities

762
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,799
but when you look at the differences

763
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,860
between treatment

764
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,920
here and here these differences are much

765
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,720
much smaller than they were in the

766
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,429
previous 30 that was done by Claudia

767
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,649
Elkins that I showed she's so much

768
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,720
bigger effects and that is probably

769
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,730
because these plants were grown

770
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,989
constantly under these different light

771
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,389
levels and they had a chance to

772
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,219
acclimate to the specific light levels

773
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:31,769
Claudia grew all of her plants on the

774
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,599
wine light level and then exposed them

775
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,920
to a different light level so those

776
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,730
plans weren't a collimated to the

777
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:40,500
conditions so much smaller effect here

778
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,650
and then he collected driveway data and

779
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,980
we see a general trend towards increased

780
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:49,829
dry weight and mizuna with longer photo

781
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,559
periods 28% increase that's actually

782
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:53,969
pretty substantial but it was

783
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,949
unfortunately a lot of variability so it

784
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,139
wasn't quite specifically significant

785
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:00,869
and so when I was working on this

786
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,219
presentation early last week I looked at

787
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:04,559
this and I thought well that's a bummer

788
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:07,980
and so last Friday

789
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,960
Shane weighed the lattice plants for me

790
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,900
so that I could look at those data and

791
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,659
for lettuce we see a smaller absolute

792
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,970
increase but for lettuce we do see a

793
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:20,009
significant increase in the dry weight

794
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:22,589
of the plants as we grow them with

795
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,630
longer photo periods and again just want

796
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,130
to be emphasized all of these plans got

797
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,200
the same amount of light so that

798
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,410
suggests that daily light integral in

799
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:35,269
itself may not be all that useful

800
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:39,000
there's a predictor of crop growth so

801
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:41,610
longer photo period resulted in a more

802
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,130
light interception higher quantum yield

803
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,289
the photosystem 2 so combined that means

804
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,010
a lot more electron transport a lot more

805
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:51,840
light energy harvested and four letters

806
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,880
are significant the fact for mizuna and

807
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,640
closely significant effect on the

808
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,650
biomass of the plant so I actually think

809
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,599
that looks very promising and hopefully

810
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,380
next week we'll have to base the basal

811
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,059
data as well to go with this so this was

812
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,990
indoors and I mentioned earlier I'm

813
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,199
actually getting more and more

814
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:12,209
interested in greenhouses right because

815
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,179
greenhouses have this dynamic light

816
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:18,510
environment so Jeff Weaver who I

817
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:20,789
mentioned previously this spring did a

818
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,430
study where he looked at the effect of

819
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:23,469
photo

820
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:26,109
on the growth of greenhouse ground

821
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:27,369
lettuce and so in history too we wanted

822
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,800
to make sure that all of these plants

823
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:32,409
got the same daily light integral that

824
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,330
is really easy to do when going in an

825
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:36,670
indoor environment and you don't have to

826
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:39,880
worry about the Sun it becomes a lot

827
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,200
more difficult in a greenhouse where you

828
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,730
don't know how much sunlight you're

829
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,069
going to get over the course of the day

830
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:48,490
so how do we actually make sure that all

831
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:50,860
of these plants get the same amount of

832
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:53,259
light by the end of the day with a

833
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,030
highly variable background from minute

834
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,990
to minute and day to day in the amount

835
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:02,710
of sunlight so we have developed a

836
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:06,699
lighting control system that can do that

837
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,650
for us in my spare time I like to

838
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:11,289
pretend that I'm an engineer and I like

839
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,090
to put things together this actually

840
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:14,679
came out of a class project where I told

841
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,200
the previous graduate student in the lab

842
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:19,809
David Jeannine oh this is your project

843
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,119
for this class you go build it and so

844
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:24,099
what we do is we measure the

845
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,639
photosynthetic photon flux density at

846
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:29,889
the canopy level using a data logger and

847
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:33,039
then we want to control the amount of

848
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:34,509
light that we provide using LEDs based

849
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:38,320
on how much light the crop is actually

850
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:40,210
receiving so we can use the system to

851
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,760
either make sure that the plans get a

852
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:46,240
completely stable photosynthetic photon

853
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,490
flux density all day long or we can use

854
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,219
this to make sure that by the end of the

855
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:53,589
photo period the plants have received a

856
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:55,059
specific daily light integral and I'll

857
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,200
show you in a few minutes how we

858
00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:01,210
actually do that but the principle is

859
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:04,119
actually pretty simple so we have a

860
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:07,179
light and LED light right here we have

861
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:11,289
the Sun a quantum sensor a data logger

862
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:14,980
and the dimmable driver and this right

863
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:17,920
here is the beauty of LEDs you can dim

864
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:20,619
LEDs very very accurately and

865
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,230
instantaneously and it doesn't affect

866
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,029
the longevity of the LED so in a matter

867
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,980
of microseconds if you want you can

868
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,100
completely change the light output from

869
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,990
LED lights and it is really easy to do I

870
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,219
probably shouldn't tell people that it

871
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:35,389
is easy I should pretend things is

872
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:38,989
really difficult but in reality

873
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:41,239
actually pretty simple so when you have

874
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:43,278
a certain amount of sunlight the quantum

875
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:44,808
sensor measures that signal goes to the

876
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:47,690
data logger and then the data logger

877
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:50,839
calculates how much supplemental I do we

878
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,849
need to provide from the LED and that

879
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:56,869
allows us to give a specific amount of

880
00:38:52,849 --> 00:39:02,019
light to the crop so when the Sun there

881
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:07,190
gets brighter the LEDs automatically dim

882
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:10,159
and so in this particular study

883
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:13,039
Jeff grew lettuce green towers and

884
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:16,038
regular greenhouse trays one week after

885
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,740
the seedlings germinated he spouted two

886
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:23,480
lighting treatments and grew the plants

887
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:25,308
for 22 days under supplemental light all

888
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,949
treatments received a daily light

889
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:29,500
integral of 17 moles per square meter

890
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:33,199
per day based on the canal

891
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:35,510
recommendations but they got that light

892
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:39,379
and for the periods that range from 12

893
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:44,299
to 21 hours we had a control treatment

894
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:46,519
that on average received about 8 moles

895
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:49,190
per square meter per day and I could

896
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:52,250
have put standard deviations with these

897
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:54,139
treatments but so the plants in these

898
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,789
treatments that received 17 moles per

899
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:58,848
square meter today the standard

900
00:39:55,789 --> 00:40:02,019
deviation on 17 moles was I believe 50

901
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:04,190
micro moles or something like that the

902
00:40:02,018 --> 00:40:06,469
inaccurate that we have in this control

903
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,539
system are much more related to any

904
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:10,669
inaccuracy that we may have in the light

905
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:14,119
sensor itself than in our control we

906
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,588
can't control the light perfectly so we

907
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,329
measure the light level every two

908
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:19,190
seconds because that's the fastest the

909
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:22,009
data logger can do everything it needs

910
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:24,349
to do and so every two seconds the data

911
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:28,400
logger calculates a new lighting

912
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:30,559
threshold that we want to maintain so by

913
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,710
the end of the day we want to have 17

914
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,990
million micro moles we subtract from

915
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,329
that how much light the crop had already

916
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:40,189
received so now we know how much more

917
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:43,039
light needs to be provided over the rest

918
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:45,230
of the photo period and we divide that

919
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,299
by the amount of time that is left in

920
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,719
the photo period and so now the data

921
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:51,059
logger need a nose

922
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,189
how much light the crop needs to receive

923
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:55,980
and it can control the LEDs to make sure

924
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,200
that that happens so this is just a

925
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,699
picture of what that looks like in the

926
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:03,449
greenness so we have the light sensor

927
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:08,189
right here light bars donated by fluence

928
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:10,529
bioengineering this is a picture of the

929
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,139
whole setup at night no plans in this

930
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:15,420
case Jeff just took this picture to show

931
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:17,819
that you can see the different amounts

932
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:21,869
of light that are provided by the LEDs

933
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,550
and the different treatments so this is

934
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:25,740
a picture near the end of the study of

935
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:28,200
plants that were grown with 12 and 15

936
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:30,809
hour photo period so the light level

937
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:33,029
here in general was higher than here and

938
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:34,920
I hope you can see that but here too we

939
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,650
saw that the chlorophyll content in

940
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,809
these plants grown under shorter photo

941
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:43,440
peers and higher light levels were

942
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:46,108
actually lower than in plants grown with

943
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:52,349
longer photo peers very similar to what

944
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:54,150
we saw indoors and so I don't have all

945
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:57,359
of the data from the study yet but jeff

946
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,710
has the driveway data for this so the

947
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,029
plants that were grown without any

948
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,000
supplemental lighting they looked

949
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,880
absolutely horrible and that drive dry

950
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,559
weight was really really low we weren't

951
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,240
really interested in that treatment it's

952
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,969
just a reference for everything else but

953
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,639
so with supplemental lighting and again

954
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:18,659
all the same daily light integral we can

955
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:21,539
see that with longer photo periods there

956
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:23,309
was an increase in the biomass of this

957
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:27,179
of these plants and in this case we saw

958
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:29,940
a 43% increase in biomass just by

959
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:36,559
providing the supplemental light over

960
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,559
longer photo periods so I'm pretty

961
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:43,039
about this because that's a very large

962
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:44,778
growth increase and it has lots of

963
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,819
practical applications for managing

964
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:50,119
supplemental light so if you have a crop

965
00:42:46,818 --> 00:42:51,558
that is for a period and sensitive you

966
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,230
really should be spreading out the

967
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,289
supplemental light over as long a period

968
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,519
as you can and in some cases you can go

969
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:01,160
up in many cases you can actually

970
00:42:58,518 --> 00:43:04,399
provide light over 24 hour periods if

971
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:07,568
you choose to do so the advantage

972
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,769
another advantage of providing lower

973
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:11,989
instantaneous light levels over longer

974
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:13,608
periods is that you can install a

975
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,528
smaller lighting system because you

976
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:17,798
don't need the same power to provide

977
00:43:15,528 --> 00:43:20,119
high levels of instantaneous

978
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:21,788
light so it actually makes the whole

979
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,079
installation of a lighting system

980
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:26,089
cheaper if you can spread your light out

981
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,769
over longer photo periods so it's not

982
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:30,710
just the physiology that makes sense

983
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:35,719
that actually I think has direct

984
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:37,309
business implications as well and so I'm

985
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:39,108
a big believer in this company so

986
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:42,589
shameless self-promotion I recently

987
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:45,558
started a company with a friend of mine

988
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:47,808
and we just got a USDA grant to actually

989
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,460
develop a lighting controller that can

990
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:52,339
automatically implement these kind of

991
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:56,059
lighting strategies for you so this is

992
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:59,298
our prototype control system there is a

993
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:01,430
light sensor I believe right here and

994
00:43:59,298 --> 00:44:04,460
then I have no idea what the rest of

995
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:07,578
that stuff is but it works so with this

996
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,889
what you can do using your phone and

997
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:11,778
bluetooth you can tell the controller

998
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:14,328
I want this daily light and to grow I

999
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:16,250
want this photo period and then you walk

1000
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,769
away from it and the controller will

1001
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:22,699
actually then take care of managing the

1002
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:25,929
lights for you so overall conclusions of

1003
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:28,699
this longer photo periods have

1004
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:31,460
interesting physiological effects higher

1005
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:33,230
quantum yield greater electron transport

1006
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,528
rate over the course of the entire day

1007
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:38,028
so we grade on daily photochemical index

1008
00:44:35,528 --> 00:44:40,309
increased light interception because of

1009
00:44:38,028 --> 00:44:43,690
morphological responses at least partly

1010
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:47,119
morphological responses to low light but

1011
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:50,190
from a practical perspective that also

1012
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,260
results in faster growth so what

1013
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,329
were able to do in this series of

1014
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,160
studies they're starting with basic

1015
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:59,639
physiological measurements trying to

1016
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,859
understand how plants use light in the

1017
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:05,009
light reactions of photosynthesis but

1018
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,809
subsequently actually then come up with

1019
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,700
practical recommendations and even a

1020
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:12,389
commercial product that came out of this

1021
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:14,250
and that can now implement or take

1022
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:17,339
advantage of the physiological knowledge

1023
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:20,130
in a production setting and with that

1024
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,980
I'm going to wrap it up I would like to

1025
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:25,500
thank the companies and agencies that

1026
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,760
have funded this mug and I would be glad

1027
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:34,440
to take any questions

1028
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:34,440
[Applause]
