1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,679
I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments. This is a series of

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,399
seminars on principles of environmental measurement. I'm not sure what number

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,519
we're on but today we're going to talk about photosynthetically active

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,890
radiation. To me every single component to this is critical to understanding

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,730
plant growth. This is one that I've been particularly involved with for a long

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,270
time in my career, and I want to give credit to Mark Blonquist who is

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,010
the chief scientist at Apogee. He and I have worked on this together for more

8
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:46,769
than 10 years refining this measurement and understanding its effects on plant

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:55,350
growth. So, let's get started with this, first thing we want to look at is what I

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,100
consider to be the eighth cardinal parameters for plant growth. So, what are

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,239
these eight parameters? So,

12
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:09,670
here we have a plant, and we always want to show the anatomically correct roots

13
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,759
of this plant. Well let's take the below ground parameters, first, of all we have

14
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:30,079
nutrients. That's one. Second, we have water. Third, we have

15
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:40,549
oxygen. Three parameters below ground that are critical to excellent plant

16
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,799
growth. How about the ones above ground. Well we have temperature and I'm going to

17
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:58,750
abbreviated that temp. We have humidity. So, 1 2 3 4 5 not necessarily an order of importance.

18
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:14,459
Carbon dioxide; critical parameter. 7- wind. We got eight, we're

19
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:30,400
missing one. The elephant in the room is radiation, and I'll put that in a giant box up here. We can

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,459
measure all of these parameters better than the plants can sense them but in the

21
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,819
case of radiation the plant is so exquisitely sensitive to that that our

22
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,709
best sensors are only equal to what the plant sees. So, I should put some

23
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:52,900
arrows here for radiation coming in and specifically today we're going to talk

24
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,879
about photosynthetic radiation, a subset of this, but I put this slide in here to

25
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,669
really emphasize how critical it is to do

26
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:09,439
radiation. All of these sensors, we can tell temperature by it's cold its

27
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:16,859
warm. We can feel the soil for water. we can tell if its high humidity. We think

28
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,440
we can tell temperature and we can tell radiation, but our eyes are a terrible

29
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:28,729
light meter. Our irides contract when we go out in bright sunlight and we don't

30
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:32,919
realize how bright it is. Then come back  inside they expand.

31
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,949
We have a very poor ability to tell the amount of light and the result of that

32
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:44,419
is, I'm going to draw another little figure here.Here's our plant outside, now

33
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:54,869
we get that same plant that looks like this, tiny leaves. People say oh your plant must be

34
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:02,230
low on potassium, it is low on light. And, anytime you have indoor plants you

35
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:07,969
really need to understand radiation. So, I can't emphasize more the importance

36
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:14,139
of really understanding that. So, let's take a look at this, multiple sources of

37
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,858
lights to measure plants. Right, we have the Sun. Here these are different types of

38
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,319
electric lights: high pressure sodium, ceramic metal halide,

39
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,579
compact fluorescent all with different colors of light, and there's a whole body

40
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:33,779
of studies about what's the right color of light for plants, and I'm not going to go

41
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,009
into that. But, our research says there's not as much difference as you might

42
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:47,579
think among colors of light. But, we're missing one key color on here and that is LEDs,

43
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:55,288
light emitting diodes. This is a picture of some plant growth chambers with different

44
00:04:55,288 --> 00:05:01,319
colors of the LEDs. There's a tremendous amount of research going on with the

45
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,478
colors of LEDs and people are using them for plant growth. So now look, a sensor

46
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,259
has to integrate all these different types of light, and accurately predict

47
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,430
radiation for plant growth and that's the focus of this seminar. How do we do

48
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,639
that, what are the options for doing that, and making accurate measurements of this

49
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,150
so we can predict the rate of plant growth?

50
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:31,459
Alright, so a couple of definitions. First, and these confusing a lot of

51
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:37,949
people P-A-R is photosynthetically active radiation and that just means that

52
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:44,978
radiation that drives photosynthesis. UV light, that's radiation but

53
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:50,259
plants filter that out, it doesn't result in photosynthesis. Near-infrared light

54
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,370
doesn't have high enough

55
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,790
energy for photosynthesis this is the radiation for photosynthesis, and we'll

56
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:08,229
come back to this again, it's 400 to 700 nanometers. This is close to

57
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:13,379
the visible range as well what are eyes see that's the radiation that drives

58
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:19,629
photosynthesis. Alright second definition, photosynthetic photon flux or

59
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:25,379
photosynthetic photon flux density. Now these two things

60
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:31,029
refer to the same thing in the next slide I'll explain the use of

61
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:36,448
these two terms. This is the whole amount of radiation again between four and

62
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:41,280
seven hundred nanometers. So, really all of these terms refer to the same thing.

63
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,339
They're all this radiation that drives photosynthesis, these terms here are

64
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:57,589
technically a little more exact and PPF and PPFD. So we get then to

65
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:04,329
what's a quantum, and this gets back to Einstein and quantum physics. A quantum is

66
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:10,889
a mole of photons and this mole is Avogadro's number of photons so it's

67
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,610
these particles coming in and we know from the Stark Einstein Law

68
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,479
that one photon excites one electron and that's the first step in

69
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,918
photosynthesis so we're really interested in measuring, with these, moles

70
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:31,500
of photons and that's what the sensors measure, and we'll talk about that in the

71
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,610
next slide. But quantum sensor then, is a sensor to measure all this stuff

72
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,819
that's when we say quantum sensor we could say a PAR sensor, we could say a PPF sensor,

73
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:47,870
or PPFD, they're all the same thing, but that's where this word comes from

74
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:54,449
quantum sensor. Or, if the sensor is connected to a meter then it's a quantum

75
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,710
meter. Now I'll show you some examples of that.

76
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:07,810
In fact I'll show you an example right now. Here is a quantum meter, sensor plus

77
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,959
the meter, and reads out all by itself you can buy just the sensor and hook it

78
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,729
up to a data logger and then it's a quantum sensor. That's all it means

79
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,080
between the two of those definitions.

80
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,009
All right now, I want to talk about this issue of flux, and I've given myself a

81
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:38,549
nice white board to do this. Flux, if we are to talk to our physicist colleagues flux has

82
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:43,709
two definitions and you would think by this time in the evolution of science

83
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:54,629
read out this term all worked out. One definition is per time and in the case

84
00:08:54,629 --> 00:09:05,149
of photosynthesis this would be moles M-O-L-E-S per second, that's one

85
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:14,019
definition of flux. Moles of photons per second, but equally valid is per

86
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:31,919
area and time. Together.  And this means moles per meter squared per second.

87
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,240
Even in physics

88
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,680
these two things are used interchangeably. If we use this

89
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:50,569
definition per time we would have PPF and then where's the area in here, we

90
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,750
better add D for density to this definition to make sure we've got the

91
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,190
area. If we use this definition

92
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,070
and we said PPFD

93
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,760
well wait a minute we've got per area and per area again, so this D could be

94
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:19,110
redundant. We wouldn't need it. If you look through the literature on this half

95
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:27,659
of the people say PPF and the other half say PPFD, the terms are used

96
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,259
interchangeably.

97
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:35,080
They mean the exact same thing, but it's been confusing to people

98
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,000
just as it's confusing to physicist. Is it flux only per unit time or does it

99
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,970
mean per unit area and time? There's the difference. For the purposes of this we

100
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:52,889
don't need to worry about it PPF and PPFD are equal. All right, now, let's go to what

101
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,039
we're looking at. Here's photosynthetically active, photosynthetic

102
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:03,199
photon flux,  photosynthetic photon flux density it means radiation between 400

103
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,509
and 700. Sharp cut offs. Now, remember that Stark Einstein Law that you're

104
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,189
remembering for the test,

105
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,840
equal weighting of all photons 1 photon excites 1 electron. Every photon

106
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:23,490
coming in up here gets equal weighting on this chart. These are blue in here,

107
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:32,060
this is ultraviolet, this is blue, this is green in the middle, and then red, and

108
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:37,979
then right after 700 its infrared, IR. Thermal radiation doesn't

109
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,180
cause photosynthesis its just this here with equal weighting of protons. T his is

110
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:49,139
what we're after a sensor that can get this sharp cut offs on the end so we can

111
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,409
predict photosynthesis and plant growth by measuring this. Right let's take a

112
00:11:54,409 --> 00:12:00,750
look at how we do this. Here is our quantum sensor we just talked

113
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:08,419
about very simple. One detector, right here, one filter and one output if we ran it

114
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:12,839
over here to a meter. This is a quantum sensor,

115
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,950
but this has to be designed with filters to get all of these colors exactly right

116
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,370
and that's a tricky business, very hard to do. If we make the jump to lightspeed

117
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:29,659
now we have a spectroradiometer and a prism it breaks up the light and we have

118
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:34,850
lots of arrays down here and this goes off to a meter. This is more

119
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:41,170
accurate it's also more than ten times the cost. So, we're going to look at these

120
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:46,120
how accurate are these compared to a spectroradiometer and comparing back and

121
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,310
forth. This is two options to do this quantum sensor, spectroradiometer. Okay. Here

122
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:57,399
is what they look like these are quantum sensors one from Licor, one

123
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:03,490
from apogee, and the apogee spectroradiometer, little bigger a lot

124
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,149
more stuff going on in here.  If we did x-ray vision we'd

125
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:16,169
have a prism and here. The light comes in it breaks the light up into multiple

126
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:23,399
detectors down here, and these have a single filter. These are

127
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,259
the most widely sold in North America Licor and Apogee. Licor came out with

128
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:35,399
a new sensor, they have a better head. It sheds water better now, than this one

129
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:43,909
which tended to trap water.  It has a nicer cable, it has a cable like

130
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:47,850
this. But, I'll talk about the new sensor in the old sensor they're

131
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,450
both equally accurate. It's just how it sheds water and how rugged it is

132
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:01,460
for outside. So there's the comparison, about ten times the cost

133
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,540
for this. So if you need very accurate measurements, this is the instrument of

134
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:11,279
choice. But, let's talk about how close we can get with these. Alright here's our

135
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,389
box again

136
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:19,069
equal weighting of photons. Kipp &amp; Zonen is widely sold in Europe, and

137
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,060
here's the Licor. Look at how closely they match the curve now this is

138
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:25,879
really good

139
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:32,309
sharp cut offs because there is multiple colors of light. It's real important to

140
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:37,869
have a sharp cut off here. These are their two model numbers. There's the new

141
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,740
Licor looks a lot like the old Licor and it's equally accurate to this.

142
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,289
Now let's look at the original Apogee sensor, that Apogee is short for some

143
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:49,969
time

144
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,910
here's the curve. It comes up a little slow in the blue and look how it cuts off

145
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:03,019
here, at about six hundred and sixty so what misses this radiation. That's not

146
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:09,419
serious because it's calibrated to light sources, unless you get a light source

147
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,490
with a lot of radiation right here. Now let's take a look at an example of that.

148
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:23,899
LEDs may come into the picture, this is a red LED and its called

149
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:30,439
deep red cause it's very close to this cut off I'm going to put deep red here but

150
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,670
this is common in some LEDs. Of course this is a blue LED, but

151
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:42,949
look at the problem it cuts off before it can capture that deep red LED. So, this

152
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:49,210
is an excellent sensor for all types of light sources except when there's a deep

153
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:55,300
red LED in the light source. So what can we do about that? Let's take a look this

154
00:15:55,299 --> 00:16:06,740
is the original Apogee that blue line that we just looked at. Apogee developed

155
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:14,740
a full spectrum quantum sensor

156
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:27,490
that's this gold line right here, that cuts off here. So you can see the gold the green and the

157
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,409
blue line are all very similar comes up better here. So if you need to measure

158
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:41,569
red LEDs or LED spectra this is better than the original, but the difference in

159
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,830
cost for this full spectrum is about two times as expensive, so all of

160
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:53,610
these are quite a bit more expensive than this. But, if you measure LEDs you

161
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,209
need them.

162
00:16:54,208 --> 00:17:01,059
Let's take a look at this here is the original black sensor. Many people

163
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,649
have this. Here's the new one it's slightly taller slightly bigger head.

164
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,910
Because it's a higher end sensor it's a gold color instead of a black color,

165
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,990
that's what the two sensors look like. Original and full spectrum. Now let's go

166
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,870
back to that graph and here's the difference again, right here. Now let's

167
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,729
take a close look at the accuracy of all of these sensors and to do that we

168
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,819
need to use this fancy integrated method originally developed in 1966 where it

169
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:35,369
takes all the colors of light and it multiplies this by the accuracy of the

170
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:40,219
spectral accuracies of these. This is something that Mark Blonquist has done

171
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:46,110
in great detail for all these. This is the equation to do it. I'm not going to go

172
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:51,419
into that now except let's look at the results how close do we get. Kipp &amp; Zonnen,

173
00:17:51,420 --> 00:18:01,190
Licor and this is also the 190 R, is very close to this, and then the original

174
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:14,630
Apogee and the new Apogee. Sunlight and cloudy,

175
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,929
these are all tiny errors, so you really don't need the full spectrum to be

176
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,259
accurate if you're just doing sun light measurements. Any errors less than

177
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:30,759
certainly 1% are very tiny, even 2% errors are fairly

178
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:38,119
small for these. All right, now we take cool white fluorescent lights. All these

179
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,649
errors, less than 2%. This is calibrated here. They are

180
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:49,850
calibrated to be 0. Small errors. Small errors. Now look at the original Apogee

181
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:58,449
here's LEDs. Red and blue LEDs. Remember it didn't capture that red peak? Big errors.

182
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,059
If you're not using it under there it's fine, but if you need these

183
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,490
you need for spectrum. We jump to full spectrum and everything gets better.

184
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,720
Metal halide a little better. High pressure sodium, better. But these errors

185
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,690
here in particular are small and you take a close look at this, and positive

186
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:23,870
video and study it. You can see that the errors between Kipp &amp; Zonnen, Licor, and

187
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:30,339
the full spectrum Apogee are all really small under all of these different types

188
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:35,740
of light sources. This one has an asterisk   because it has separate

189
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,500
calibrations for Sun and electric lights. That's explained on the Apogee website.

190
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,660
All right let's take a look at the next slide here.

191
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:54,870
Spectroradiometer,  remember the ten times, bigger, more expensive sensor? It nails every single

192
00:19:54,869 --> 00:20:01,549
source. 0 errors, because its measuring every color individually. So if you

193
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:10,169
really need excellent accuracy you need to spectroradiometer to do this, but most

194
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,890
people if they have two or three percent accuracy that's good enough for their

195
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:25,480
applications. Okay, I'm going to conclude on this slide Apogee also makes a line

196
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,930
quantum sensor and it looks like this. When we want to measure radiation

197
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,690
underneath the canopy it's really variable,

198
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,779
there's bright light and shadows. This sensor averages the light over the whole

199
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:47,359
length of this. If you start to cover some of these

200
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:55,009
it gives you a proportionately reduced reading. This is something that is

201
00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:00,680
helpful for people for transmitted light. Of course I have examples here

202
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,720
hooked up to meters.  I guess I should put them in the same order

203
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:16,279
as this, but the old and the new sensors. Again the new one is full spectrum and

204
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:22,009
more accurate under all the different colors of light. I hope this overview

205
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:28,400
of some terminology and some differences among meters is helpful to understand

206
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,170
and make more accurate measurements of photosynthetically active radiation. We

207
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:41,590
look forward to another session on other topics in environmental biophysics

208
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:43,109
thanks for listening.
