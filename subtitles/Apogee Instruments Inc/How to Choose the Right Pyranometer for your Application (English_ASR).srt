1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,879
hello my name is Skylar Schmidt and

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,250
we're going to talk about Parana meters

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,009
from Apogee instruments choosing the

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,089
right sensor for you so we're going to

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,699
cover today

6
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:13,259
what the pyrometers measure the

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,320
difference between our different series

8
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,990
the 100 200 500 series the output

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,149
options for these sensors and what the

10
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,799
SP 420 is and then we're just going to

11
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,948
list a couple of common applications

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,469
that people use our parameters for so

13
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,990
the pyrometer measures shortwave

14
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,299
radiation and it does it in units of

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:37,140
watts per meter squared that's also

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,299
known as energy flux density all of our

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,250
sensors are calibrated to match the

18
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,099
spectral response of high-end blackbody

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,619
thermo-pile pyranometers there's a link

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,469
there to the traceability but what we

21
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,359
want to show is what that means so here

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,520
in the background we have the solar

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,780
radiation spectrum into the red and the

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,260
black lines there so our SP 100 and 200

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,489
series measured from 360 to 1120

26
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,978
nanometers that's what the spectral

27
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:09,929
range is the spectral range of the

28
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:11,879
thermo-pile parameter is 385 to 2105 but

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,100
the range that all of our parameters

30
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:19,859
both the silicon cell and the blackbody

31
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:23,099
is from 285 to 2800 nanometers the way

32
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,618
we do that is we use these set these iso

33
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,359
classified secondary standards and these

34
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,569
are the standards that we reference all

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,478
of our parinama ters - and then we send

36
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:36,298
those iso classified parameters into the

37
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,280
National Renewable Energy Laboratory to

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,140
be calibrated there which then

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,868
references back to the world radiometric

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,519
reference in Davos Switzerland and so

41
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,259
that's how we're able to calibrate our

42
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,048
sensors that have a smaller spectral

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,920
response to match the output of high-end

44
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,780
blackbody thermo-pile pyranometers so

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,879
what is the difference between the

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,009
thermo-pile parameter and the silicon

47
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,078
cell parameter well there's an extra

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,368
excellent video put out by my colleague

49
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,438
mark Blomqvist

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,409
and you can click there click up in the

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,669
corner and you can watch that video and

52
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,909
that's going to explain the advantages

53
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,679
of the thermo-pile parameter but to

54
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,780
break it down simply

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,609
and clear sky conditions the silicon

56
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,049
cell Parana meter works great and is

57
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,810
going to give you very accurate readings

58
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,629
in cloudy conditions and overcast

59
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,949
conditions the thermo-pile pyrometer is

60
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:28,679
going to be the best most accurate

61
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:31,138
sensor for you so if you know about the

62
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,090
shortcomings of the silicon cell and are

63
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,849
aware that then that one might be what's

64
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,250
what's going to work for you but in all

65
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,899
applications the thermo-pile is going to

66
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,449
give you those that more accurate data

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,310
and then down below is just a comparison

68
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,009
chart you can click on that if you want

69
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,658
to see that on our website we also are

70
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:52,798
going to have that same chart on the

71
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:57,358
video here in a minute so the SP 100

72
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:59,188
series the silicon cell based spectral

73
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,810
response we talked about its self

74
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:05,519
powered it means that the output is

75
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:08,459
between 300 0 and 350 millivolts and so

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,158
the SP 230 has that same output where

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,408
its self powered but it has a heater

78
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,628
built in so that the rain the do the

79
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:18,780
frost can be melt off with just 12 volt

80
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:20,878
input all of these sensors are we are

81
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,908
interchangeable the SP 110 and the SP c

82
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,009
30 so if you have SP one tens right now

83
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:28,348
but you'd like the heated version the SP

84
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,120
230 you can just change those out and

85
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:32,158
they'll have the same calibration factor

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,908
of 5 watts per meter squared per

87
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:39,060
millivolt the SP 200 series has the same

88
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:41,128
sensor as v SP 100 it's just the

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,098
amplified versions so we have a zero to

90
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:46,469
2 point 5 volt version 0 to 5 volt

91
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,959
version and 4 to 20 mili-amp version

92
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:51,959
those do require to be powered by 5 to

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,150
24 volts and they're interchangeable by

94
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,549
type so an SP 215 is going to have the

95
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,979
same calibration factor as another SP

96
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:04,379
215 the SP 500 SP 600 series these are

97
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,379
all thermopile sensors the larger

98
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,598
spectra response there self-powered and

99
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:12,120
so they have a smaller signal than our

100
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,488
other self powered one 0 to 114

101
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,220
millivolt built-in heater in both

102
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,019
sensors and then each one does have an

103
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,570
individual calibration factor so they

104
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,968
are not interchangeable like the SP 100

105
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,560
and 200 series if you change the sensor

106
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,000
you do need to change the calibration

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,220
factor as well

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,980
and this is that chart I referenced

109
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,600
before you can pause if you want to look

110
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,790
at something specific we're just going

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,879
to going to go through and look at the

112
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,340
output and the model number so so for

113
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,269
the SP 110 is a 0 to 350 millivolt

114
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:50,000
output SP 110 0 to 2 point 5 volt output

115
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:55,199
SP 212 4 to 20 milliamp output SP 214

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,319
you had a 5 volt output SP - 15 0 to 350

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,409
millivolt with the heater SP 230 and

118
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,529
then the thermo-pile parameter the SP

119
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:08,610
510 is the upward looking model and then

120
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:11,539
these are approximate the approximate

121
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,540
sensitivity on that

122
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:18,599
alright the SP 420 is the same silicon

123
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,180
self sensor is the SP 100 and SP 200 it

124
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,010
just has a USB output so that it

125
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,889
connects straight to a computer and you

126
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,050
can use the computer as they logger and

127
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:30,870
so it requires a computer tablet to

128
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,579
display the output and then it also in

129
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,139
comes with the Apogee Connect software

130
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,259
is included when you purchase this

131
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,969
sensor this example of what the software

132
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,279
looks like you can see the instantaneous

133
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,140
output here just after you have the

134
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,509
software downloaded and it's connected

135
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,849
and then if you want to do logging mode

136
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,680
you just set up your logging sampling

137
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,470
interval logging interval and then it

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,329
will show you the logging information

139
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,950
over there and then where that logging

140
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:59,430
information is saved is right here in

141
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:02,399
the CSV file so this is fantastic

142
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,110
for for residential homes if people want

143
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,120
to put this up on the rooftop next to

144
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,310
their solar panels and see the amount of

145
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,699
available solar radiation compared to

146
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,370
what their solar panels are producing so

147
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,829
a couple of common applications just

148
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,168
what I just mention their

149
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:21,060
evapotranspiration calculation as far as

150
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:23,219
the amount of solar radiation being

151
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,439
calculated for that weather station

152
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,180
solar irradiance so you can see the

153
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,899
amount of solar radiation hitting a

154
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,709
particular spot the energy balance this

155
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,000
would use our SP 510 SP 610 and that

156
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:37,918
would help you calculate the amount of

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,069
available or the amount of shortwave

158
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,329
radiation coming in

159
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,389
and the amount of shortwave radiation

160
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:44,800
leaving and then to estimate the solar

161
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:46,899
thermal load on commercial building

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
we've had some customers buy these and

163
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:50,979
put them inside windows to see what the

164
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,230
