1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,028
hi I'm mark Blanc with the scientists at

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,429
Apogee instruments and I'm here to talk

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:11,370
today about a relatively new product in

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,870
Apogee it's a new thermal pile pyrometer

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:18,809
the model number is SP 510 before I talk

6
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,079
about the specifics of the sensor I want

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,549
to talk a bit about the motivation for

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:26,848
creating a new thermal pile sensors

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,028
Apogee is traditionally manufactured and

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,130
marketed silicon cell pyrometers so I

11
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:35,700
have some data here three different

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,510
plots on the graph on the x-axis is

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,059
wavelength from about 300 to 2500

14
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:44,429
nanometers and on the y-axis is either

15
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:49,259
normalized irradiance or spectral

16
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:53,670
response the red data set is a clear sky

17
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:57,599
solar spectrum the blue data set is an

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,120
overcast sky solar spectrum both of

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,460
these data sets are normalized at 500

20
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,658
nanometers so you can see the shape

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:11,099
comparison how the spectrum changes from

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:13,799
overcast skies and clear skies the black

23
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:17,609
data set is the spectral sensitivity of

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:21,090
a silicon cell pyrometer and silicon is

25
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:24,299
sensitive from about 350 to 1100

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,060
nanometers so it captures much of the

27
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,850
radiation coming from the Sun but it's

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,290
not sensitive to the the wavelengths out

29
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:36,839
here beyond 1100 nanometers and when we

30
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,969
go from clear sky to overcast sky

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,359
conditions often that's where the

32
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:44,099
largest changes in the spectrum occur so

33
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:48,180
if a silicon cell sensor is calibrated

34
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:50,849
to measure accurately under clear skies

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,479
as the sky gets cloudier and cloudier

36
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,949
this can do introduce errors and so if

37
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,500
we have these three pieces of

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,890
information the clear sky spectrum an

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,409
overcast sky spectrum and the spectral

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,590
response of this sensor we can actually

41
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,469
predict what the error will be assuming

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,569
calibration to one of the conditions so

43
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,870
if we assume calibration to the clear

44
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:18,119
sky spectrum

45
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,500
the theoretical error prediction for the

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,718
overcast sky spectrum is about 10% so

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,688
what this means in practice is shown in

48
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:29,968
these data here and just have two

49
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:30,840
consecutive days from September of last

50
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:33,509
year

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,819
the black plot if you can see it

52
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:38,009
underneath the red one there our

53
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,468
measurements from a secondary standard

54
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,289
blackbody thermal pile pyrometer on the

55
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:47,908
rooftop of the apogee building then the

56
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:51,090
red plot is data from an Apogee SP 110

57
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:53,098
silicon cell pyrometer mounted next to

58
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,188
the secondary standard also on the

59
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:59,699
rooftop of the Apogee building so if we

60
00:02:56,188 --> 00:03:03,299
calculate the error on a daily total

61
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:07,858
basis the silicon cell matched the

62
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:11,489
secondary standard no error on the clear

63
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:14,129
sky day on the cloudy day however there

64
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,609
was about an eight percent error and you

65
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:21,378
can see the the percent differences in

66
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:25,229
this lower plot here these are 15-minute

67
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:27,509
averages then compared relative to the

68
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:31,139
secondary standard to provide a error

69
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:34,098
measurement so these data as I mentioned

70
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:37,049
were collected with an Apogee SP 110

71
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:39,688
silicon cell pyranometers but you would

72
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,000
find similar results for any silicon

73
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:44,340
cell pyrometer and it's because the

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,109
limited spectral sensitivity of silicon

75
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,829
as we mentioned and showed on the

76
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:53,189
previous slide it's only silicon is only

77
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:55,139
sensitive from 350 to 1100 nanometers so

78
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:58,709
it's not capturing all the changes in

79
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:01,009
the solar spectrum silicon cell sensors

80
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,348
traditionally have been quite popular

81
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:06,539
because of their low cost they do work

82
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:09,719
relatively well as long as people

83
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,158
understand that these errors exist when

84
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,158
going from clear sky to cloudy

85
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:16,798
conditions silicon cells can be useful

86
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,529
they're often found in state Mesonet

87
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,968
networks for example or in plain of

88
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:26,129
array measurements for solar panels so

89
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,509
at Apogee we've often tried to to

90
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:30,719
maximize

91
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:33,120
formants and minimized price so our real

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,780
goal in building the new thermo-pile

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,090
pyranometers the SB 510 was to make

94
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:43,079
something that improved upon these

95
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:45,629
cloudy or overcast sky airs with silicon

96
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,750
cell centrists but still kept the price

97
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:51,980
similar to silicon so and I have one

98
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:55,740
here to display you can see it's small

99
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:59,610
compact and similarly shape to the

100
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:03,689
standard Apogee silicon self-censor to

101
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:07,139
show you how it performs we actually

102
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:10,439
have data for an Apogee SP 510 for the

103
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,529
exact same two days that we showed for

104
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:18,689
the silicon cell so again if we compare

105
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:23,819
daily total errors we get no error on

106
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:26,519
the clear day and minimal error on the

107
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:30,269
cloudy day only about 1% you can see

108
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,919
down here that the 15-minute periods the

109
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:36,089
errors are much smaller for the

110
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,250
thermo-pile sensor just to give you an

111
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:42,109
idea of some more of the the features

112
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,250
and performance of this particular model

113
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,780
we've had seven replicates of the SP 510

114
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,970
some prototype sensors that have been

115
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,829
deployed continuously on a rooftop for

116
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,110
three and a half years we've been

117
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:58,529
comparing them to secondary standard

118
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,060
Pyron ometer all of the seven replicates

119
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,799
have been stable none of them have

120
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,589
changed by more than one percent per

121
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,470
year some of the features it has a low

122
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:09,869
thermal offset less than five watts per

123
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,770
meter squared because it doesn't have

124
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:16,920
the traditional glass dome of a standard

125
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,779
thermal pile sensor has a diffuser more

126
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,939
like a silicon cell and we can better

127
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,069
thermally bond that to the thermal pile

128
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,540
detector itself and it reduces the

129
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:30,269
thermal offset all of the SP 510 s come

130
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,730
with internal heaters these can be

131
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:35,039
controlled by the user so the heater is

132
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:38,580
optional but the heater can certainly

133
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,290
reduce error caused by precipitation Dew

134
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,289
and frost

135
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,900
and also as I mentioned previously we've

136
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,970
targeted low-cost were offering the this

137
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,449
particular sensor and only 30 percent

138
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:56,610
more than the standard Apogee silicon

139
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:59,279
cell heated model the SP 230 so the the

140
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,139
new thermo-pile Perrin ometer from

141
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,079
Apogee instruments is really targeting

142
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,060
markets where silicon cell pyranometers

143
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,979
have been traditionally used but where

144
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,899
higher accuracy is required and also any

145
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,350
application where thermo-pile

146
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,319
pyranometers have been used in ISO

147
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,460
classification is not required

148
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,750
appreciate the opportunity to present

149
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,750
thanks for your time
