00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,670
When repairing or lengthening an instrument cable, making a proper wire

2
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:19,929
splice that is durable and weatherproof is easy when you follow these instructions and

3
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:25,600
use an Apogee Instruments wire spice kit. Before you begin to gather these

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:34,730
suppliers: wire cutters, wire strippers, a  heat gun, soldering iron and solder, and

5
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:39,019
an Apogee wire splice kit, which includes solder sleeves and polyolefin adhesive

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,340
lined heat shrink. In the following demonstrations will be using 26 gauge 2

7
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,370
conductor shielded cable. For other kinds of wire the process is the same, but you'll

8
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,929
need an additional solder sleeve for each conductor. Step one, strip the outer

9
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,869
cable insulation five eighths of an inch while stripping and tinning the individual wires

10
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:59,000
one-quarter of an inch.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,030
Note that tinning the individual lead wires helps to eliminate cold solder joints by cleaning

12
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,519
the individual strands and allowing solder to flow more freely. Step two, slide the

13
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,978
solder sleeves on to the wires making sure the tinned ends are inside the solder rings.

14
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:17,469
Step 3, slide the outer heat shrink onto  one of the cables to the side of the

15
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,069
splice.

16
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,879
Be sure to slide it up far enough under the cable away from the joint so that the

17
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,849
heat gun will not heat it up before your finished with the next steps. Step four, slide the

18
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,369
cable that is to be spliced into the other end of the solder sleeve, making

19
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,680
sure the tinned ends are inside the soldering. Verify the wires matchup for

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,320
example red to red, black to black, and so on.

21
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,559
Step 5, heat the solder sleeves using a heat gun until the solder flows. Remove

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,460
the heat and be careful not to pull the cable, on the individual wires until

23
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,019
solder is set.

24
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:52,078
Step six, slide the polyolefin adhesive lined heat shrink over the

25
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,078
junction of the wires. This will seal the splice from the elements.

26
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,239
Allow an extra one inch of coverage by the heat shrink on the outer jacket of

27
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,978
cable to ensure a good seal. Use the heat gun and notice that the heat shrink is forming tightly

28
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:06,670
to the cable and splice. The adhesive lined heat shrink will have a glossy

29
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,000
look once the glue has followed. Be careful not to overheat the heat shrink.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,639
If overheated it will start to warp and eventually melt away. Allow all the parts

31
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,348
to cool before moving. Please note that the heat shrink will be flexible when left

32
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:22,949
warm but will hold an angle if left bent while its cooling. There may be a small

33
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,500
amount of adhesive coming from the heat shrink ends this is normal, and done

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,769
properly cable splice can be just as weatherproof as the jacket itself. In fact

35
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,760
We use Atum brand heat shrink and have conducted tests showing that it's at

36
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,489
least as impermeable to water ingress as the cable's santoprene jacket. Unless

37
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,140
otherwise noted adhesive lined heat shrink has a difficult time adhering to

38
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,179
teflon cable, also known as PTFE.
