1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:29,189
This follows up nicely with net radiation because we just talked about

2
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,859
the fluxes at night. Mark said what happens at night. The incoming is 0

3
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:42,030
and if the sky is colder than the ground there's a continuous flux of radiation

4
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:50,549
to the cold night sky, and the surface can get very cold. It's under

5
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,538
appreciated how cold surfaces can actually get at night when the sky is

6
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:05,250
clear. One of the examples of the power of this is if you build an insulated box

7
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:14,599
especially a tall box. I'm going to draw this here. If we build

8
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:23,849
a circular cylinder like this, and it's well insulated.We fill

9
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:30,359
this. This is open on the top but it's full of insulation. Now we put at the

10
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:40,140
bottom, a dish of water. We paint this black to have a high emissivity. This is

11
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,450
open. We take this cylinder and we put it outside in in the summer on a clear

12
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:56,280
night. This a PhD comprehensive exam question I like to ask. What happens to

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,549
the water? This is room temperature. I should have little blue for

14
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,080
the water, and a shallow dish of  water.

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,060
The air temperature out here, let's  say  it's 30

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,530
degrees C, it's a pretty warm night but it's clear. What happens to the water?

17
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:33,360
Does it change temperature? Yes. Does it get hotter or colder? Colder. It's

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,850
radiating to the clear night sky. When we went outside with those things and it said the

19
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:49,169
sky temperature is -30 or some cold temperature. The incoming radiation is

20
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,169
real tiny because it's cold. It can't warm up by conduction and convection

21
00:02:54,169 --> 00:03:00,239
because we insulated this thing. If if the wind is blowing, it'll keep it

22
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,400
warm, but if it's a calm night and it sits there... I read this in

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,719
some physics book a long time ago. So I built this in my backyard,

24
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,430
and got all the instruments, I put thermocouples in here and sat out there

25
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,920
at night and measured this thing... It gets colder and colder. It's continuously

26
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,750
radiating to the sky and even when the air temperature is 30 degrees the water

27
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,620
freezes inside this column.  It's coming to equilibrium with the sky,

28
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,370
a super cold temperature. This isn't just a physics experiment. People can use

29
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,020
this in the tropics to keep food cold. You can radiate to the sky at night and

30
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,120
then in the daytime you just cover it, and you cool it down at night. No

31
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,680
electricity just the physics of radiation to the sky. This gives you a

32
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:01,740
sense of the power of longwave radiation at night. What happens to a

33
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:09,989
surface, a leaf of a plant or a surface, at night when it's clear? If it's cloudy not

34
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,020
much happens because the clouds are low and they're similar to ground

35
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,949
temperature, but if it's clear they cool off.

36
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:22,289
You run models because we if you buy a net radiometer and you measure it and

37
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:30,150
model it. We see conditions where it's easily five degrees C below air

38
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:37,109
temperature and there's cases when it's in 10 degrees C below air temperature

39
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:47,580
at night. That led us to make this sensor, a radiation frost sensor, which is

40
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,389
a way cheaper version than having to buy a net radiometer and run all these

41
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:58,409
models any way to predict surface temperatures at night. It's black so

42
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:04,650
it has a high emissivity. It's similar, like 0.96, it's similar to leaf

43
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:11,879
surfaces, black disc. Then we put it outside and we measure then the

44
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:18,750
temperature of the surface of that disc with a tiny thermistor. I'll show you

45
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,139
some data in a minute but you can see how this simulates a leaf temperature. Or

46
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:31,129
there's another sensor here and a tiny little thermistor, for a bud of a plant.

47
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:37,829
This is called when a surface freezes and the air temperature never

48
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:44,310
got below freezing that's called a radiation frost. It's a huge deal

49
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,680
worldwide for commercial fruit producers where the sensitive flowers are

50
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,730
coming out, you can see those in the background, little buds in the spring

51
00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:00,390
coming out on that plant and if those get below freezing they can lose

52
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,639
millions of dollars in commercial yield because they're flowers freeze.

53
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,349
Because it's such a big deal they start wind machines, they start sprinkler

54
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,550
irrigation to freeze water, they do all kinds of things to protect their crop,

55
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,189
but they need to know exactly when to start this. I call this radiation

56
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:26,639
frost sensor or also a nighttime surface temperature sensor. It measures these

57
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,629
physical principles of radiation transmission

58
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:42,709
and temperature. I think my next slide, we don't have one of these here.

59
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:52,439
We could have picked them even worse data than this but this is a

60
00:06:52,439 --> 00:07:00,269
typical data for a night in our spring in the northern hemisphere where this is

61
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:05,370
that sensor and the temperatures are all coming down together but it's a clear

62
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,819
night hours from midnight ,we're getting close to midnight, now look at that big

63
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:16,079
leaf sensor cooling off, a little bit. When it's calm wind this is wind

64
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,699
speed it really starts to diverge a lot. The wind will warm it back up

65
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,050
when it gets cold but if there's not a lot of wind it just keeps getting

66
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:31,050
colder. Right in here somewhere if you are only measuring air temperature

67
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,240
you wouldn't be worried about a frost. The air temperature is + 3

68
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,639
degrees C but the leaves are already starting to freeze. It gets bigger

69
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,029
and bigger, and finally four hours after midnight the air finally gets below

70
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:53,669
freezing but the plant has been below freezing for quite a while. Frost is

71
00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:00,210
the big economic thing for freezing of sensitive buds, but it's also gives you

72
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:04,439
an indication of nighttime surface temperatures. We talked about

73
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,730
measuring those in the day and predicting water loss at night. It's more

74
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:15,450
of models and predicting rate of development of plants. If we understand

75
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,250
the night temperature, we can predict rate of development. It's a pretty

76
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:26,279
simple sensor it's it's not an expensive sensor and it's been particularly useful

77
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:34,829
to commercial tree crop producers to tell when to turn on their fans to

78
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,770
protect their crop at night. This is a pretty simple story once

79
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:48,319
you understand the concept of net radiation.
