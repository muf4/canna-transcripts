1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,819
summarize this and I remember to get my

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:11,009
space blanket out of my car so now you

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,000
can all understand how I can get nice

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,000
and warm in here

5
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,750
everyone should carry one of these for

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,368
emergencies like in their back pocket

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:27,750
they might become more important than

8
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:31,039
your cell phone yeah but and I think

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,539
mostly you can buy these at camping

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,539
that's where people end up using them

11
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,339
but I think these are so good car

12
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,019
manufacturers should all have a be

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,430
required to have a little pocket in the

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,590
door and they're one of these comes with

15
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:48,030
the car in the pocket if you ever get

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,929
stranded in a cold place and you can use

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,030
it we ended the last lecture talking

18
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,570
about radiation for us on a gift some

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,730
examples of that here's a picture of a

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,189
radiation frost detector just a flat

21
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,338
black disc so you can see how nicely

22
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,560
that radiates to space doesn't work at

23
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,480
all in the day because it keeps way up

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,879
above air temperature but it's designed

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,560
to only do at night so here's an example

26
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:20,548
graph of what this looks like at night

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,810
and this was a few years ago air

28
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,880
temperature bud and leaf now bud

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,149
temperature is a single little sensor

30
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,609
about the size of a fruit bud and here's

31
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,649
a classic example of this there is

32
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:40,140
everybody's above the zero Celsius so

33
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:44,670
we're all happy but right here the air

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,840
temperature is +3 and the wind this is

35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,320
there's wind speed the wind died oh can

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,320
I go back

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:10,569
I'm going backwards here let's see we

38
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,569
got it we got to get back to that page

39
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:28,699
we were close to there we get to start

40
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:33,620
now all the way back okay

41
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:36,849
it opened up as a damn page so we can

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,849
there we go

43
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:47,180
here we go thank you the wind dies and

44
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:49,549
the the temperatures separate and we

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,770
have the beginning of a leaf starting to

46
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,850
freeze because it's below air

47
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,550
temperature so now the wind picks up and

48
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:00,500
not enough it's still calm wind and then

49
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,600
the wind dies here and these separate

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,969
and now clear these leaf has been below

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,729
freezing for several hours and then

52
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:11,569
finally the little tiny bud even goes

53
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,949
below freezing so the blue line or at

54
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,439
least the red line is what a grower

55
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:17,719
ought to be after not just the black

56
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:24,979
line and historically they've used the

57
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:31,430
black line so now we can go back to our

58
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:34,399
our camera what a growers do to protect

59
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,730
against frost this is a huge industry

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,520
and it's common to have problems that's

61
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:43,789
why fruit orchards are located on this

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,439
tops of valleys on the edges because the

63
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,389
cold air drains to the middle and

64
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,459
they're somewhat protected by elevation

65
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,779
we don't have fruit orchards in the

66
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,000
middle of the valley they're up along

67
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:58,310
the benches took perked up for that

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,569
reason many years ago and I remember

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,670
this as a kid growing up in Minnesota

70
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,370
reading about the Florida fruit growers

71
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:10,488
oranges in Florida and they would get

72
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:15,610
these dross late spring Foster's tender

73
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,610
buds are out so here is a picture of

74
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,298
some fruit trees

75
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:29,288
somewhere don't have to be in Florida

76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,519
the most common way to protect your

77
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:38,620
fruit trees was to light this thing

78
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:40,779
called the smudge pot and it was

79
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,639
designed to burn really inefficiently

80
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:46,089
and make a whole bunch of black smoke

81
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,350
and they never got all that hot but this

82
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:52,750
black smoke would go up like this

83
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,419
and guess what they've just blocked the

84
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,550
cold night sky and this was effective

85
00:04:55,418 --> 00:05:00,639
for protecting trees against this

86
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,819
radiation Frost because that emissivity

87
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,610
was blocked and these were used for

88
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,439
decades by fruit growers and they'd have

89
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,800
them all over their orchards and they'd

90
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:14,680
go out and light the smudge pots and

91
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,129
well they really make bad air pollution

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,569
so they were banned and now what are the

93
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:27,370
growers gonna do to keep their fruit

94
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:32,288
crops alive well if they could increase

95
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,908
the wind that would help them so I don't

96
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:38,310
have a picture here but they're not hard

97
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:41,589
to find the smudge pots go away and

98
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:46,180
there are pictures on the internet of

99
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:49,899
huge towers they look like reverse

100
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,750
electric wind generators blow and wind

101
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:55,810
over their crops all through the orchard

102
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,610
to mix the air and these are cooling by

103
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,629
radiation but they're warming them back

104
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,729
up by wind

105
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:04,629
so they both prevent inversions because

106
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:07,029
the wind but they also mix the air so

107
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,129
that they the airflow over the leaves

108
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:11,500
warms them up and they don't have a

109
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:16,120
radiation for us they just have leaves

110
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:21,098
similar temperature the air so when is

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,389
is a solution but these wind generators

112
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,939
and I've talked to some of the fruit

113
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:29,218
growers in Utah

114
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:32,560
they tell me they cost $10,000 per hour

115
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:34,658
to run that these are big wind

116
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,269
generators and if they're super

117
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:38,509
expensive

118
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:40,159
and of course I'm going geez you know

119
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:42,139
wouldn't you like to just put a few

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,910
thousand into a lot of really careful

121
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,800
monitoring because if you could just not

122
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,380
run this for an hour you've paid for

123
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,150
your whole weather station so we're

124
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:52,009
getting there but better better

125
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:54,560
monitoring so they can pinpoint when

126
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,030
they have to turn these on but this they

127
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,360
pay for themselves the value of the

128
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:01,309
fruits so much but now there's the third

129
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,569
technique that's getting more and more

130
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:08,780
popular and you're gonna love this

131
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,848
picture this was the cover of the

132
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:16,549
American Society for horticultural

133
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:19,310
science a few years ago and this is a

134
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,439
fruit tree crop I think this was in

135
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:25,788
Florida Dorf fruit trees are in pots and

136
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,250
it's the first thing in the morning and

137
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:29,860
you would go oh a lot of bummer you know

138
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,550
his crop is ruined

139
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:39,830
but this grower is so happy and you see

140
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:43,310
that sprinkler right there this is using

141
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:46,968
latent heat of condensation to keep his

142
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:50,060
trees warm they go below freezing he

143
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:53,240
turns on the sprinkler and this is cold

144
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,218
water but when that water freezes it

145
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,418
releases heat and it warms the leaves

146
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:01,250
only once you start this you have to

147
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:03,348
keep going all night long because it

148
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,228
can't stop but he keeps running the

149
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:08,689
sprinklers the water keeps freezing

150
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:10,490
doesn't pollute the air doesn't cost ten

151
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,348
thousand dollars an hour he's just

152
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,500
running his sprinklers but it's using

153
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:19,668
physical principles to prevent frost in

154
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:22,189
his crops and this is now the most

155
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:24,379
widely used method of frost protection

156
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:27,079
it makes a mess there's mud everywhere

157
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,060
in a yacht uses water but it uses water

158
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,068
in the early spring there's usually more

159
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,349
water and it's way way cheaper than

160
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:35,479
running these vans so it depends on the

161
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,658
orchard this is harder to do of course

162
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:43,278
if the trees are big but it's a great

163
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:47,328
principle and when I saw this and

164
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,889
started thinking about this I think I've

165
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:53,269
a data logger in my

166
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:55,549
and I run the wire out and my yard at

167
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:59,000
the thermocouple and put it next to my

168
00:08:55,549 --> 00:09:00,799
garden and I didn't want to automate

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,340
this because well I miss all the fun I

170
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:06,740
had to turn on a radio when the

171
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,840
temperature got below freezing so I get

172
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,480
up and put on my slippers and go turn on

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,769
my irrigation controller and this is a

174
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,080
picture of my garden in 82 Crockett

175
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,850
Avenue on one morning after a radiation

176
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,740
frost it's a little glarry but this

177
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,460
looks like those orchards all covered

178
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,159
with ice

179
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,340
nothing froze I had tomatoes that made

180
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,959
it through the night it was a great

181
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,280
achievement and of course I'm monitoring

182
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,110
how the temperature went with

183
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,209
thermocouples out in my garden so this

184
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,919
isn't just a theoretical thing you can

185
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,050
do this in your yard to keep your

186
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,549
Tomatoes going longer in the fall and

187
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:45,859
all you have to do is pay for the water

188
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:49,129
bill no it just it just sits there and

189
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:52,370
freezes it protects them it doesn't it

190
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:54,620
it could I suppose but it's if it if it

191
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,470
got a heavy and a branch broke off it

192
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,330
could damage the plant but but it

193
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,420
doesn't happen all at once it's just

194
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:17,000
little tiny freezing and it gradually

195
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:18,620
builds up so this our frost sort depends

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,139
exactly where you left when the Frost's

197
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,090
are there there later campus than they

198
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:25,460
are in the middle of the valley but in

199
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,930
the middle of Lu or sometime in

200
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,129
September and into early October but the

201
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,989
problem is you get one frost and then

202
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,490
you might get where you hold that Indian

203
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,769
summer two or three weeks of nice

204
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:41,899
weather you can take advantage of that

205
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:44,949
if you if your client didn't freeze yep

206
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,949
late September

207
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:54,569
yes so that so the question is what

208
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,399
happens in the day well now the Sun

209
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,590
comes up in the radiations more

210
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,539
favorable and the Sun shines on it and

211
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,759
it melts the ice and they're fine

212
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,349
yeah you could you could probably keep

213
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,259
irrigating and

214
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,940
melt it off or something but but if the

215
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,549
Sun melts enough and that's actually

216
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,870
kind of important that it doesn't throw

217
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:19,859
up immediately but it's typically a cold

218
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,500
clear night is followed by a sunny day

219
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,080
it's clear at night it's clear the next

220
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,019
morning so it warms up and you can melt

221
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,360
all the ice and the temperature swings

222
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,939
are big so and it just barely went below

223
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,399
freezing so the next day is it pretty

224
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:40,530
easily melts all the ice the next day so

225
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
this is one of those things you got to

226
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:43,199
try this at home

227
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,240
because it works and you just need a

228
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,280
little controller to tell when it to

229
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,769
turn the sprinklers on you need to know

230
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,539
when to turn them on because you make it

231
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,939
worse if you turn them on too early it's

232
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:56,009
not freezing no it's wet and now it

233
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,870
makes them colder it only makes a

234
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,600
mourner when there really are a below

235
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,759
freezing so you want to get the timing

236
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,409
just right and calculate the leaf

237
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,110
surface temperatures and when they're

238
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:11,370
freezing then you start and then they

239
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:14,339
have plants can take minus one below

240
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:17,399
freezing but they can't take minus 2 or

241
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:22,190
3 and this keeps them right close to

242
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,189
freezing so

243
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,879
a couple other follow-up things on

244
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:40,159
conduction and convection this is an

245
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:44,000
article from a few years ago a newspaper

246
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,769
article nice concise summary but many

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,950
people know and everybody knows about

248
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:52,730
wind chill and if you grow up in a

249
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,620
really cold place and it's windy and the

250
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,320
winter the wind chills way colder than

251
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,028
the air temperature and when I was a kid

252
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,150
growing up they closed schools because

253
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:05,210
the windchill got so cold that they just

254
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:08,299
closed the school well it turns out the

255
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,639
windchill factor was initially a really

256
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:13,009
crude factor by a guy in our Antarctica

257
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,809
put in a can of water out and then

258
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:17,149
looking at wind and how long it took the

259
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:20,509
water to freeze and he made this crude

260
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:24,470
index so much later people came along

261
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:27,740
with biophysical principles of heat

262
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,100
transfer and made a new wind chill

263
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,379
factor and what they found was this guy

264
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,200
overestimated it and so it's really not

265
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:40,639
as cold as it seems when we have the

266
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,259
corrected index and people were slow to

267
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,600
use the new one because everyone likes

268
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,519
to brag about how cold it is and really

269
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,209
not as bad as it seems but this is a

270
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,250
short summary of this and calculating

271
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:54,079
the the windchill we do that by the way

272
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,169
on campus we have a line for windchill

273
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,970
and the winter how cold it gets but it's

274
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,458
it's a great and now this is widely used

275
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,980
I mean now people when they do school

276
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,979
closings they don't use the embellished

277
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,120
windchill factor they use the real one

278
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,120
this is a nice summary of that

279
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:30,279
so I've had these beads up here for a

280
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:33,339
for a couple of days can you see those

281
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,899
Gris and this and this thing and I

282
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:40,509
forgot to show these to you the other

283
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:42,610
day I had occurred to me to make this a

284
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:46,210
couple years ago when I was asked to do

285
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,870
a TED talk on water and I wanted to find

286
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:52,450
ways to emphasize what's in the air and

287
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,830
so we went to El Sporting Goods and

288
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,110
bought a bunch of these little white

289
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,280
pellets and then we had to paint them

290
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:03,810
colors to get this but this big jar

291
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,809
represents the nitrogen in the air

292
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:13,210
twenty point nine five percent this is

293
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:17,759
the oxygen in the air this one is the

294
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:23,019
carbon dioxide there's 10,000 of these

295
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:26,919
bb's to every four and and the point is

296
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:29,199
wow the plants have to find those four

297
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,419
molecules - for photosynthesis that's

298
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,160
just remarkable and here's what we get

299
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:35,649
to work with we have twenty point nine

300
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:39,699
five percent for our breathing but

301
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:41,049
here's the other thing water you look at

302
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,840
what's in the air and nobody ever

303
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:45,849
mentions water because water is so

304
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,170
variable these are other ones are very

305
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:52,870
constants and now we had water to this

306
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:59,909
so if you counted these I made this

307
00:15:52,870 --> 00:16:03,970
example three percent water which is a

308
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:05,319
typical day in the summer if this was

309
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,629
air in the winter

310
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,460
and if this was a real thing I could

311
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:11,519
take this and I would just pour a bunch

312
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,410
of these out so there's just a few left

313
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,569
winter air hardly has any water in it it

314
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:19,750
is so cold the water can't hold anything

315
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:23,440
so this jar would just have a few water

316
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:26,198
molecules in it if we made hot humid air

317
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,579
this could get could this could double

318
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:31,929
this amount of water vapor in the air

319
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,750
but I've always liked this because it's

320
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:39,758
a nice concise visual demonstration of

321
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:41,980
nitrogen oxygen water vapor and co2 and

322
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,199
all the other stuff like there's a

323
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,170
little argon and the other stuff we can

324
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:51,309
ignore but we certainly can't ignore

325
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:53,438
these four Co twos when I was a kid

326
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:55,899
there's a there would have been three in

327
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:57,610
this jar now you know how old I am

328
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,828
old enough to remember when there were

329
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:03,459
three in this jar and now we got this up

330
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:05,139
to four and we're working another twenty

331
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:08,859
thirty years we might get it up to five

332
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:11,230
in the jar that's that 400 parts per

333
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,658
million for in that jar but it's a great

334
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,588
visual demonstration of what's in them

335
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:20,020
air I suppose I could do this with some

336
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:22,269
leaf and have these inside the leaf and

337
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:23,949
in the air and then you could even have

338
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:25,808
them kind of falling out of the leaf to

339
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:28,298
show transpiration rate and there's

340
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:30,668
probably a lot you could do with bee

341
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:36,490
bees from else trophy or else boarding

342
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:39,880
goods it's a great thing now I want to

343
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,500
switch a bit ome another miscellaneous a

344
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,600
couple other miscellaneous things are

345
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:48,069
interesting this came up the other day a

346
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:50,019
little bit comfort box on a psychometric

347
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:52,269
table I'll look this up this here's the

348
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:55,119
same psychometric chart this is for the

349
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:57,220
space station humidity and temperature

350
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,308
interact so they say we try to get in

351
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,990
this box and then people are comfortable

352
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:05,109
and it varies a little bit with humidity

353
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,819
so when when you do building control you

354
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:08,798
try to arrange your humidity and

355
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:15,129
temperature to be in the comfort box or

356
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:21,038
the room it also came up the effective

357
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:24,159
pressure on this psychometric chart so I

358
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:27,490
thought of a way to show this this is a

359
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,470
psychometric chart for sea level I

360
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,319
probably can zoom in just slightly on

361
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,929
this and it looks exactly like the ones

362
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,789
we handed out now this has other factors

363
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,040
in here has enthalpy and things

364
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:44,619
but this is the chart for sea-level now

365
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:48,639
I made a transparency of the exact same

366
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:51,369
chart for our elevation I didn't make it

367
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,410
I looked it up and printed it so I'm

368
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:57,039
going to lay this on top of this and

369
00:18:53,410 --> 00:19:00,640
trying to line up the zeros and they

370
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,579
look pretty close they're not exact but

371
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:13,000
they're pretty close so when you look at

372
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:17,019
these this shift is like this as you go

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,769
to high elevation this saturation curve

374
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:22,420
shifts up

375
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:26,639
and here's 1500 meters in here sea level

376
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:31,810
and I looked at the numbers for 28c and

377
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:35,650
the absolute humidity 100% at 28 C at

378
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:38,619
sea levels twenty four point six and in

379
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:43,600
in Logan it's 29 now that's a big

380
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:48,039
difference but after you divide for air

381
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:51,490
pressure this number is 86 percent of

382
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:55,629
that number and our pressure is 86

383
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:58,839
percent of sea level so when this chart

384
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:02,070
is per kilogram it's a different chart

385
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:05,799
everything shifted if this chart is

386
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:08,889
saturation vapor pressure and you divide

387
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,230
by pressure its then it's the same chart

388
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,540
you don't need charts for elevation they

389
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:18,069
only differ when you have amount of

390
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:21,309
water per weight of air not per volume

391
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:23,139
of air um you could see when the when

392
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,730
the pressure is less that that air

393
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,030
dilutes and it's the same amount of

394
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,490
water

395
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:33,190
so these that's why we simplified that

396
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:36,390
whole chart to just do that saturation

397
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,390
vapor pressure curve

398
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:45,778
now I want to talk about in in closing

399
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,839
implementation of all of these

400
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,278
principles we've been talking about in

401
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:54,058
what's called the pennmen Monteith

402
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:57,329
equation we use this two guys Penman and

403
00:20:54,058 --> 00:21:00,599
Monteith we used this equation all the

404
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:02,730
time to calculate evapotranspiration and

405
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,939
i'm going to show you the equation and

406
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:10,499
say how do these principles go into this

407
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:15,210
equation to do this perhaps the best

408
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:20,608
book for this is this book called food

409
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:23,190
and agriculture organization fao 56 crop

410
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:26,489
evapotranspiration guidelines for

411
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,970
computing crop water requirements so

412
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:31,079
this is full of step by step

413
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:35,399
implementation of these principles I can

414
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:37,349
probably put this right here and it

415
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:39,839
occurs to me that with this thing I

416
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:42,748
could just open the pages in and show

417
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:47,868
the pages instead I made some I copied

418
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:51,419
some of the key graphs out of this yes

419
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:52,858
that this thank you and this the

420
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,109
question is there's a website for this

421
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:57,839
and you can get the whole book on the

422
00:21:55,108 --> 00:22:00,480
web I think the book the paper copy cost

423
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:14,788
quite a bit but the website is free and

424
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:22,440
yeah so let's jump right here - mmm the

425
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:27,009
pennmen monte here it is I have to fold

426
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:31,570
this to make it fit

427
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:31,569
I'm gonna zoom in just a bit

428
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:42,170
so now we can I could probably soo-min

429
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:46,490
even more get this big so here's the

430
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:48,620
pennmen Monteith now this varies the

431
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:52,309
coefficients vary depending on the units

432
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:54,889
everything has units and in a rough

433
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:57,289
sense if we took all these energy

434
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,220
balance principles and rearranged the

435
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:02,450
equation they would have a lot of

436
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,950
coefficients like this but let's look at

437
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,740
the difference so first of all this is

438
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,990
with the units in here

439
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,509
reference evapotranspiration now what

440
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,450
this means is the maximum you could get

441
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:18,559
for the conditions in millimeters a day

442
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:22,039
so you could do that with this then look

443
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,990
at the next components net radiation -

444
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,369
soil heat flux now we didn't put soil

445
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,829
heat flux in here but it wouldn't be

446
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:30,229
hard we could just say sums disappearing

447
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:32,949
in the ground and sums coming back out

448
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:37,450
of the ground so there's net radiation

449
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:40,819
right front and center in this equation

450
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:45,980
then we go air temperature that's that's

451
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:48,980
jump to a saturation minus iere so

452
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,620
there's our leaf - air difference in

453
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,660
this equation the rest of these

454
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:58,429
coefficients without going into this in

455
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:04,150
detail are units conversion to get this

456
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:05,529
- net radiation and resistance to water

457
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,780
flow

458
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:12,500
here's another key thing that people

459
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:14,690
don't think about in this U is wind

460
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,769
speed that's the universal symbol for

461
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:20,720
wind speed this is in the numerator this

462
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:22,579
is in the numerator as these get bigger

463
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,000
transpiration gets bigger look at wind

464
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:29,899
speed it's in both the numerator and the

465
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,720
denominator of this now we have wind

466
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,890
speed is just up here house wind speed

467
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,890
in the numerator and denominator

468
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,920
if you ask the question does wind

469
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:47,990
increase transpiration this wind

470
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:50,769
increased transpiration true or false it

471
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,230
depends

472
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:56,450
there could be no change - that's a

473
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,509
tricky question and in fact it turns out

474
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,580
I heard this was a part of a law case

475
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:06,349
once with somebody suing somebody else

476
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:10,970
over water rights and the wind if the

477
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:15,139
leaf is already well watered and it's

478
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:18,110
close to air temperature the wind will

479
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,850
end it or if it's especially below air

480
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:22,579
temperature the wind will definitely

481
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:24,500
increase transpiration by a lot because

482
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:27,259
it's warm and the wind warms the leaf up

483
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,029
because it's below air temperature and

484
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,369
most of the time when we use this it's

485
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:36,009
for well watered crops and then when

486
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:39,379
does increase it but now imagine a

487
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:42,049
cactus or some plant that's water

488
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,710
stressed the leaves are 10 degrees C

489
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:49,220
above air temperature transpiration

490
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:51,590
minimal but the wind starts to blow the

491
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,440
leaves cool off there's a case where the

492
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:57,259
wind could decrease transpiration if the

493
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,360
plants water stressed and and the wind

494
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:02,329
helps cool the leaves down that's an

495
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,428
exception but it could happen and in

496
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:06,259
intermediate cases you can kind of see

497
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,660
that from here with a numerator and

498
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:10,640
denominator wind doesn't have as big of

499
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,160
an effect on transpiration as most

500
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,740
people think

501
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,590
yet it cools our skin

502
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,049
well we're benefiting from both of these

503
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:23,869
when when we're out and we're hot and

504
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:26,269
the wind breeze blows we cool off but in

505
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:29,109
the case of water we're only we're only

506
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:35,509
worried about this so this book

507
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:39,399
FAO 56 includes this nice graph here

508
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:43,220
figure 10 effective wind speed on this

509
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:46,640
and here's increasing wind speeds hot

510
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:49,710
and dry it's helping but as it gets more

511
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,259
humid that the effect here is effective

512
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,269
example of no effect of all and even

513
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:58,680
this effect is not all that great this

514
00:26:54,269 --> 00:27:02,160
is not a real steep line so this is

515
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:09,890
because wind effects it can cool off the

516
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:15,870
leaves significantly this another useful

517
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:21,480
figure from this here is an example of

518
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:24,209
these components through the day we just

519
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,930
talked about to calculate examples right

520
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:30,750
here at noon but here's our

521
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,900
evapotranspiration and they shall lambda

522
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:36,390
for that symbol H is conduction and

523
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,860
convection H is a common symbol for that

524
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:43,200
and G is storage in the ground but

525
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:45,569
there's the total and it's partition

526
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,269
roughly equal into the two parts and

527
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:53,399
this particular example et was more than

528
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:55,740
this in the mornings when it's cool et

529
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,110
can equal net radiation and then find

530
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,660
the transpiration can't keep up and then

531
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:04,319
sense of then the leaves start to warm

532
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,330
up but you can imagine scenarios like

533
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,829
this where these the partitioning of

534
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:09,809
these changes all over the place

535
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:12,240
depending on water of the plants but

536
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:16,220
it's a nice diagram of how that changes

537
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,220
through the day so

538
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:38,410
we another important aspect of this that

539
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:43,399
is often overlooked this calculates ET

540
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:48,700
but now we have a coefficient with this

541
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:53,960
and as we've run these equations its ET

542
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:55,850
zero or uh or all eto and all you can

543
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,420
think about is optimum this is the

544
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:00,859
maximum that could run and everybody

545
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,870
runs this equation and they calculate

546
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:05,059
the maximum and I think that's what they

547
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:09,139
got to irrigate with and that's the

548
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:11,509
maximum not them not that typical so we

549
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:15,170
have all those components that we just

550
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:17,390
showed in this big honkin equation

551
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,120
measured with great precision with all

552
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:25,310
of our instruments to get the inputs

553
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:30,919
just right in this and then to estimate

554
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:33,559
actual we multiply this by K and a lot

555
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:38,450
of times its Jonas Casey that's a crop

556
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,980
coefficient and it changes with the

557
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,140
amount of ground cover when the plants

558
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,299
are little there's not much of a pore

559
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,470
transpiration they fail in this goes up

560
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:50,990
so this and this number varies from zero

561
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:54,110
and I've seen it as high as one point

562
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,430
two it actually can go above one which

563
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:57,349
says something about whether this is

564
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,830
really the optimal because the crop

565
00:29:57,349 --> 00:30:06,079
coefficient is even higher than the

566
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:10,579
optimal this is a very coarse estimate

567
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:12,859
of the water so even if we get this to

568
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:15,439
three significant digits with the most

569
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:17,809
precise instruments ever we got to

570
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,529
multiply to this which at best is plus

571
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:29,210
or minus 10% maybe 20% so this and then

572
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:32,190
this equals DT of the C of the crop of

573
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:35,919
the actual crop

574
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,359
and not many people think about this we

575
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,090
take a number that we're trying to get

576
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:42,728
super precise and we multiply it by

577
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:45,368
really kind of a ballpark estimate and

578
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:48,999
that leads to a lot of people really

579
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:54,819
over irrigating in the implementation of

580
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:58,600
this this is mrs. F here's a diagram of

581
00:30:54,819 --> 00:31:01,329
that in this book of the reference crop

582
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:07,209
ETO and then you multiply by this factor

583
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:09,158
to get 80 of them Crump and then because

584
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,808
plants aren't always well watered even

585
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:15,580
with all of this this is still for well

586
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:19,210
watered then we try you might show this

587
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:22,089
down here back out just a bit then we

588
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:25,389
try to put an adjustment factor in here

589
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:28,209
for how water stress they are so we have

590
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:31,028
to fudge factors on this precisely

591
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,558
measured et the crop coefficient and

592
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:35,079
then the whoa this is really a water

593
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,989
stress coefficient and we get the crop

594
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,628
coefficient adjusted oh boy by the time

595
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:42,308
we get to this one where it's kind of

596
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:44,108
like spray-and-pray you're hoping you

597
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:46,658
got it in the ballpark for irrigation

598
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:51,478
and meanwhile we're running out of water

599
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:56,739
so there's there's a lot of potential to

600
00:31:51,479 --> 00:32:01,649
calculate water I want to talk about

601
00:31:56,739 --> 00:32:05,858
another technique of calculating this

602
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:09,908
that well first of all there are at

603
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:13,178
least 20 equations in the literature for

604
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:15,789
calculating evapotranspiration from

605
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,769
weather variables all over the place and

606
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:23,108
they're in there in discussed in this

607
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:25,929
book Blaney Krita I forgotten all the

608
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:29,158
names but many many people have worked

609
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:31,869
on this this is becoming the standard

610
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,909
because our weather stations are getting

611
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:36,009
better and we have instruments to

612
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:38,889
measure all the parameters to do this

613
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:41,710
and it is the most biophysical it's

614
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:45,250
based on physical principles so we've

615
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,220
come to trust this but it lots of

616
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:50,680
people don't have all the instruments to

617
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,120
measure the inputs to this so what are

618
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,289
they going to do and what did they do

619
00:32:52,119 --> 00:33:02,259
before the pennmen Monteith was was

620
00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:08,680
usable here is a one-page handout we

621
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:11,799
keep two pages that I wrote this for

622
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,590
them there's some of the introduction to

623
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:20,379
this Utah climate book about ways to do

624
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:24,279
ET and I'm and hopefully easy to read

625
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:26,050
but it shows more than 20 equations have

626
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,000
been developed to do this here's the

627
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:30,639
potential it summarizes all the stuff

628
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,150
then we get to this the Hargreaves

629
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,210
equation George Hargreaves is on the

630
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:42,370
faculty here at Utah State University

631
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:45,400
and of the 20 equations I would say next

632
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:49,209
to the pennmen Monteith his is one of

633
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:52,890
the best it works the best and it is way

634
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:56,920
simpler than the pennmen Monteith to run

635
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:59,140
here's the equation and I've been told

636
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:04,950
this story by Rick Allen who was on the

637
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:07,240
faculty who has written much he has a

638
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,490
award-winning paper called the pennmen

639
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,710
for all seasons and it's about the use

640
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:14,529
of the pennmen Monteith equation in all

641
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,199
conditions all around the world and Rick

642
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,510
tells me even he and Hargreaves died

643
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,480
about two years ago he lived here in

644
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:25,419
Logan he said Hargreaves would come in

645
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,059
his office and that the models didn't

646
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:30,489
match the measurements and and he'd say

647
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:32,559
yeah and the two models wouldn't agree

648
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,449
that our graves in the pennmen monty

649
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,369
'then he'd say yeah well that's because

650
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,019
your models too complicated and you're

651
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:40,418
gonna get bad data in it and if you just

652
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:43,329
use my model it's simple and it works

653
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:44,980
and it does work for a wide range of

654
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:49,929
conditions that look at the inputs to

655
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,969
this min and max temperature Wow

656
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,980
this was from the days when there were

657
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:56,918
no data loggers we just had min max

658
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,400
thermometers that was it that's all we

659
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,339
had to go on

660
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:06,349
and his brilliance in developing this

661
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:11,079
was to empirically correlate min and Max

662
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:14,059
temperature with pan evaporation and

663
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:16,579
he's got mean right here but that was

664
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:19,549
the mean was in between men and Max so

665
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:21,319
he still had men and Max this is the

666
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,830
sport of the point oh five this is the

667
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,140
square root RA he said all he had to do

668
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:30,710
net radiation no he didn't he calculated

669
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:33,469
it based on radiation above the Earth's

670
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,720
atmosphere that was a completely a model

671
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:39,500
based on latitude he didn't have to

672
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:42,409
measure net radiation he calculated it

673
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,719
from the time of year and the Sun above

674
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:49,329
the atmosphere and then here's a

675
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:54,009
coefficient and this equation for ETO

676
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:56,449
works remarkably well and it's way

677
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,220
simpler but we we don't use it much

678
00:35:56,449 --> 00:36:00,379
anymore because we've got lots of

679
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:03,349
instruments and we can use them far more

680
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,110
complex Penman Monteith when you get

681
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:10,940
into the literature on this and you turn

682
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:13,820
the page this is with my colleague Larry

683
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,000
hips talking about this this Hargreaves

684
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:19,880
tends to under predict under high wind

685
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,780
conditions and over predict in high

686
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:27,230
relative humidity so it's not perfect

687
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:29,900
and then when it gets to minus 17.8 C it

688
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,400
goes nuts because it values go negative

689
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,250
but you're not too worried about that

690
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,860
because those are super cold days it's

691
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,639
made for them summer but I show this

692
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:43,010
just because it's a it's a brilliant

693
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:45,519
empirical equation then does a pretty

694
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:48,520
good job match in the evapotranspiration

695
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,519
data

696
00:36:53,369 --> 00:37:02,980
I'm gonna close with this picture as we

697
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:06,669
work and work and work to model this and

698
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:10,690
calculate it we keep going back to Lysa

699
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:14,849
meters a big container that we can weigh

700
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:18,280
water is heavy we can accurately measure

701
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:20,799
transpiration used by weight but you

702
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,840
have to contain the plants in something

703
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,810
you can weigh and all of a sudden you're

704
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,760
into ten twenty thousand dollars per

705
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:30,730
container in the field to set up a

706
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,740
system to weigh the plants so this is a

707
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,590
system in art and the research

708
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:38,109
greenhouses that my students and I build

709
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,420
and each one of these has a load cell

710
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,849
underneath it and here's some corn

711
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:45,670
plants in a bucket to get evaporation

712
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:48,039
low we covered them with tinfoil but we

713
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:51,460
can do various levels of water stress in

714
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:53,469
here using lysa meters and look at these

715
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,559
principles and see how well they apply

716
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:58,869
to different kinds of plants we can do

717
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,759
precision water stress with this because

718
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:03,099
we can bring them down to a low weight

719
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,350
and keep them there just water enough to

720
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:07,750
keep them there we can tell they well

721
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:10,210
how well water stress they are we can

722
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:12,909
determine obviously hourly transpiration

723
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,949
rates with this this is all hooked up to

724
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:17,819
multiplexers and Campbell scientific

725
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:20,619
data loggers too and we watch them

726
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,620
transpire on the screen this has been a

727
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,839
really useful technique of course it

728
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:27,579
constrains the roots so there's our big

729
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,230
interacting factor or what would they do

730
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:31,719
in the field if they had more roots and

731
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:36,159
we can get bigger lysimeter so we can

732
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:39,789
get bigger load cells but they don't

733
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:41,500
have the precision so it's all and then

734
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:47,670
you can't have as many replicates if you

735
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,670
have big load cells so mark question

736
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,910
we have a photosynthesis terming the

737
00:38:51,730 --> 00:39:04,690
energy balance but because

738
00:38:53,909 --> 00:39:06,849
photosynthesis is small this application

739
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,869
you have a higher precision instruments

740
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:15,369
to very accurately weigh the water you

741
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:17,500
know exactly what what water loss is but

742
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:23,170
there's going to be a mass gain because

743
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:28,590
of the carbon right yes yes now we're

744
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:31,000
into the details so the the question is

745
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,100
the way to this will change because the

746
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,929
plants are getting bigger and not just

747
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:37,539
the dry weight but the fresh weight of

748
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:39,639
the plants are getting bigger and we do

749
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:41,739
worry about that and in some cases we

750
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,469
calculate it out in most cases we

751
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:46,269
calculate it out but this brings up a

752
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,919
really interesting opportunity to make a

753
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:49,659
point you would think wow aren't you

754
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,440
using this to measure the size of the

755
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:55,629
plants and not know every the water in

756
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,000
the soil because the weight of the water

757
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:00,640
down here is several orders of magnitude

758
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:06,159
greater than the fresh way to the plants

759
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:10,029
and the water use efficiency of these

760
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:13,259
plants might be one gram of dry weight

761
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:15,700
per thousand grams of water transpired

762
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,220
so that says something about and it

763
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:21,689
might be 10 grams of fresh weight or

764
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:23,709
thousand grams of water but the water

765
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,780
transpiration and the water flux through

766
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:29,710
this is at least a hundred times bigger

767
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,570
than the fresh weight gain and we back

768
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,539
calculate the fresh rate gained by the

769
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:38,800
water lost if we've transpired a hundred

770
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:42,730
grams of water then 0.3 grams of fresh

771
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,840
weight is added to the system so it does

772
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:48,880
matter but it's small because of the

773
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,490
poor water use efficiency because of

774
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,490
waters fluxing through those and the

775
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:56,469
fresh weight gains tiny

776
00:40:54,489 --> 00:41:04,919
if we just go buy this replacement that

777
00:40:56,469 --> 00:41:12,129
you pull 10 grams of 10 grams water

778
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:15,309
that's 1% right yes we were saying maybe

779
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:27,838
2% of the radiation and one percent of

780
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:30,579
the water so very similar yes this so

781
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:33,099
one two hundred it might be fresh wait

782
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:36,338
but photosynthesis makes dry weight and

783
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:38,800
that's more like one to a thousand even

784
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:42,730
a thousand grams of water lost and one

785
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:50,310
gram of dry weight showing up which kind

786
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:55,389
of its small and depending on the model

787
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:58,088
it photosynthesis can be 5% and so now

788
00:41:55,389 --> 00:42:00,069
if we're really tweaking this model we

789
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:02,049
can start to put coefficients in for

790
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:08,080
this but this leads to a larger issue

791
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:10,300
with models at least in my experience we

792
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,699
start putting more coefficients into

793
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,619
this thing and we forget about the

794
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:17,409
importance of the two big things I love

795
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:18,910
simple models you get the relationships

796
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:21,489
right in your head and you start to

797
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:23,710
think about it and then we start to add

798
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:25,509
more coefficients and the tendency is to

799
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:28,000
think we've made a better model because

800
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:30,790
we have 14 coefficients instead of two

801
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,338
and it gets in the way of people's

802
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:37,679
thinking to have extra coefficients and

803
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:40,088
they're in many cases they don't add

804
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,879
they don't fundamentally add to the

805
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:47,349
precision of the model this is obviously

806
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,240
a a big discussion among lots of people

807
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:51,430
as how many coefficients to put and how

808
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:53,858
many are useful I think it's analogous

809
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:54,809
to how many significant digits you show

810
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:57,098
in a spreadsheet

811
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:59,920
well great we can calculate a

812
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:01,809
spreadsheet in Excel put six six or

813
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,000
eight significant digits on every number

814
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:06,019
and now you're scanning that spreadsheet

815
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,150
looking for patterns in the data

816
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:11,480
and all those extra digits are just

817
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:15,230
noise and they they block our ability to

818
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,090
see the big picture of patterns these

819
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:23,240
are all sidebars related to your

820
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:26,329
question but but photosynthesis is in

821
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,699
some of the models and for sure when you

822
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:31,009
apply this to soils now the not yet have

823
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:33,529
storage we didn't talk about storage at

824
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:36,530
all but the book goes into storage

825
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,510
quite a bit and that's a whole nother

826
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,490
subject term getting that storage

827
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,740
component right which is why we have

828
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:45,229
heat flux sensors in the soil to try and

829
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:47,569
measure that and it's hard to measure

830
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:50,570
so we'd model back and forth measure and

831
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:52,780
model and hope we got that part of it

832
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,780
right

833
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:02,259
so I'll end there you've been a great

834
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,550
audience thank you for coming to these

835
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,780
lectures and hopefully you find places

836
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,780
to apply this stuff

837
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:11,940
