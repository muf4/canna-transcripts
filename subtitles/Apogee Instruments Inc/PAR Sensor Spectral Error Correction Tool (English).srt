00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,240
Hello, my name is Ben Crabb.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,440
I do technical sales and support here at Apogee Instruments.

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,550
I’m here to talk about a tool that we put together to help our users of quantum (or PAR)

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,980
sensors to get more accurate measurements under a variety of lighting sources and correct

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,399
for the spectral errors that may occur.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,400
Let’s do a little examination of the quantum sensors that Apogee carries.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:30,919
We carry two basic varieties of quantum sensors: our original quantums and our full-spectrum quantums.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,340
The originals came out a number of years ago.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,560
They are a low cost option that produce very accurate measurements under broad spectrum lights.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,940
Their spectral response drops off a little bit in the red range and the blue range, but

11
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:47,850
they are an excellent choice for most lighting conditions.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,219
The tool that we’ll go over momentarily is most applicable to these original quantums.

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,229
The full-spectrum quantum has a response that more closely approximates the PAR response,

14
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:03,799
which is 400 to 700 nm, which has been defined as the wavelengths of light that plants can

15
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,798
use for photosynthesis.

16
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,780
So this is a look at the spectral responses of those two types of quantum sensors,

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,780
as well as the PAR response.

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,000
The PAR response being shown by this black dotted line.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,879
And the original quantum response being the thick black line.

20
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,568
You can see it drops off in the red range out here from 655 to 700, and it drops off

21
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,590
a little bit in the blue range as well.

22
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,271
So if your light emits a lot of light in those portions of the spectrum, the original quantum

23
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:35,159
is going to read a little bit low, erroneously low.

24
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,329
The full-spectrum spectral response is indicated by this gold line.

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,858
You can see that it nearly approximates, very nicely approximates, the dashed black line

26
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:46,949
of the official PAR response, and so it’s going to provide very accurate measurements under

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,909
any lighting conditions.

28
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,649
Let’s move to the tool.

29
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:57,379
Here is the page for the tool, and we will include the URL in the comments section down below.

30
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,978
Let’s scroll down and examine it.

31
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:01,409
It’s pretty easy to use.

32
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,599
The way it works is you just select your sensor and your light source and this display will update.

33
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,099
The green line indicates the spectral response of the sensor, the red line indicates the

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,550
output of the light, and the black dashed line indicates the official, or the defined,

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,420
PAR response, which is 400 to 700 nm.

36
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,649
And so as we select the different sensor options, we have two different original quantums.

37
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,750
One’s been calibrated to read most accurately under sun; the others been calibrated to read

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,139
most accurately under T5 lights.

39
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:38,639
And then we have our SQ-500, which is one of our full-spectrum quantum sensors.

40
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,750
It’s going to read accurately under any lighting conditions.

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,889
So, as an example, what we have selected here is “clear, sunny” day.

42
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:53,009
This is the lighting spectrum that would be expected on a clear, sunny day.

43
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:58,620
And we see that our sun calibrated SQ-110 original quantum sensor the expected error

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,819
on this guy (let’s unclick this) our expected error on this guy is 0 % and the correction

45
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,699
factor being 1.00.

46
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,399
That just means you take your reading from your SQ-110, you multiply it by the correction

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,000
factor, in this case it’s 1.00, and you get a more accurate PAR reading.

48
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:19,719
Of course in this particular instance, multiplying by 1 you get the same reading because it’s

49
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,289
already very accurate.

50
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:26,400
But if you had used this electric calibrated sensor, original quantum sensor, it’s the

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,230
same sensing technology but it’s been calibrated to read accurately under T5 lights.

52
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,879
Now you take it out in full sun, you measure PAR, and you get a reading that is about

53
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,199
14 % lower than it should be.

54
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,780
So the tool says to apply a correction factor of 1.16.

55
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,650
So you take your reading from your SQ-120, you multiply it by 1.16, and you get a much

56
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,939
more accurate PAR reading.

57
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:51,039
And so that’s the way the tool works, and you can scroll through the different preloaded

58
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,280
lighting spectra we have in this tool.

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,640
You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to go through it quickly if you like.

60
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,439
This little rectangle up here will be color-coded yellow if the error is between 5 and 10 % and

61
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:09,310
red if it’s expected to be more than 10 %, and it will show those correction factors.

62
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,449
One thing to note is that with LEDs, which emit a lot of their light in very narrow spectral

63
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:19,719
ranges, if you use a deep red LED, so the one we have displayed here is a deep red LED

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,350
with a 668 nm peak.

65
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,740
Now this is outside the range of highest spectral sensitivity of the original quantums.

66
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,090
So the original quantum sensor doesn’t pick up much of that light very effectively, and

67
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:36,459
so it’s reading, I mean this one says the expected error is negative 65 %, so it’s

68
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,849
going to be very low.

69
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,240
And you can apply that correction factor, but do it with caution because if the sensor

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,340
is not detecting much of the light, and you try to correct that, you may not get a really

71
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,519
reliable reading.

72
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,490
You’ll be better to get a higher quality sensor such as the full-spectrum quantum.

73
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,810
A couple other things to note on this tool is we have this check box down here to show

74
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,050
correction factor for underwater measurements.

75
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,900
It’s useful for people who like to measure PAR in their aquariums for corals and such.

76
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:18,199
When you select this, the display will update and it will show the expected error in air

77
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,439
and the expected error in water and correction factors for both situations.

78
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,680
So that’s how that works.

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,310
And then we a final functionality of this tool.

80
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,639
You can upload your own custom lighting spectra, or if you don’t find your lights on the

81
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,139
list here, or you know the spectra of your light is different than what we have loaded

82
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,790
here, you can upload your own data.

83
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,490
You just click this browser button and you navigate to the .csv file on your machine.

84
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,329
It expects the first column to be wavelength expressed in nanometers and the second column

85
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:55,519
to be light output.

86
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,870
And when you do that then you just select the custom data from .csv file under the light

87
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,930
source, and that display will update.

88
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,340
In this case we haven’t uploaded any light data, and so it says to upload some data.

89
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,439
Anyway, what else do we have?

90
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,960
… I think that’s all we have.

91
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,449
This tool is under development.

92
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,959
