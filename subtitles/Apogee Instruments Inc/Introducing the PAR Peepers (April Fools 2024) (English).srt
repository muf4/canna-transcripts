1
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,165
Alright looks like we're all rolling.

2
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:10,099
Apogee has been a leader in affordable

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,032
environmental measurement tools for 28 years.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,966
And in that time

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:17,233
we've learned a lot about creating amazing results.

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,300
We work tirelessly developing accurate sensors.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,566
We've designed rugged housings,

8
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:24,166
perfected the lenses, and engineered

9
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,800
multiple ways to make our sensors

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,300
as accurate as possible.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,300
We often find ourselves asking though,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
how do we take our sensors that next level of quality,

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,900
that next level of accuracy.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,533
From extensive research we feel that

15
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,899
that next level of accuracy

16
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,466
will not come from what's in our devices

17
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,765
but rather how we can adapt our devices

18
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:46,199
to control their external environments.

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,865
Our radiation sensors spend years in the field

20
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:52,133
with little to no human intervention

21
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,600
through the measurement process.

22
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,900
Through years of detailed study

23
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,033
we found our greatest measurement challenge comes from

24
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,865
essentially biological sources

25
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,932
sources outside of our control.

26
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,266
In order to prevent excessive,

27
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,899
shall we say, "build up" on our radiation sensors,

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,500
we needed to find a way to deter avian species

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,965
or birds from releasing their payload

30
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:22,099
onto the measurement devices.

31
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:23,900
It took a lot of time

32
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,800
but we developed the perfect solution.

33
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:28,565
Introducing

34
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:31,200
the latest in a long line of environmental monitoring

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,165
innovations from Apogee Instruments

36
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:35,066
the Apogee PAR Peepers.

37
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:37,533
The Apogee PAR Peepers are industry leading

38
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:38,500
animal deterrent

39
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
that reduces errors as a result of animal interactions.

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,966
The PAR Peepers require no additional power

41
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,465
and can be mounted on all Apogee sensors.

42
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,466
The PAR Peeperss use the innovative Scare Tactic

43
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:52,665
Avian Repellant Equipment technology.

44
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,700
This STARE technology

45
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,800
utilizes nonviolent means to keep the birds away

46
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,099
utilizing a bird's natural

47
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,265
instinctive fears of natural predators

48
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:03,266
to keep the birds away from your sensors.

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,299
Through a challenging and iterative research process

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,900
we're able to determine the ideal pupil to iris ratio.

51
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,932
Too small and the deterrent was ineffective,

52
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:18,632
too large and it became excessively adorable.

53
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:20,966
It took some time and effort

54
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,800
but we are able to get it precise and accurate.

55
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:27,433
By keeping the birds away from your sensors

56
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,832
you can have confidence in your measurements,

57
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:33,466
and confident measurements is what we're all about.
