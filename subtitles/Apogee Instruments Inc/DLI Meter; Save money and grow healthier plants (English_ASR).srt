1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,120
this little device could save you money

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,318
and keep your indoor plants looking nice

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,318
and

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,359
healthy it's called a DLI meter and it

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,878
tells you just how much of that sweet

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,038
sunshiny goodness your plants are

7
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:19,118
getting think of it as like a rain gauge

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,720
but for

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,839
sunlight every plant needs to have light

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,518
to grow too little and nothing will

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,559
happen too much and you run the risk of

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,759
stressing your crops now every plant is

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,879
different some need a little light while

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,640
some need a lot more luckily a lot of

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,559
really smart people have done a lot of

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,799
work in determining how much light

17
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,399
specific plants need a good place to

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,078
start is by searching DLI requirements

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,679
on the internet for the specific plant

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,840
that you're trying to grow odds are

21
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,840
you'll see a number like 18 moles per

22
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,360
meter squar per day and often they'll

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,680
say that that light needs to be over a

24
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,799
6-h hour period that 6-h hour number is

25
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,198
called the photo period this DLI

26
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,439
requirement is the amount of light that

27
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:00,000
a plant needs to thrive and be healthy

28
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,399
all right so we've got our DLI

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
requirements we know kind of what our

30
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,198
Target is there's two ways that I like

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,960
to measure DLI with this DLI meter the

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,920
first way is to take the DLI meter press

33
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,559
and hold the button and then it'll

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,799
change it into ppfd readings and you

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,560
take those ppfd readings by holding it

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,600
at the canopy of the

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,680
beans seeing what your ppfd is and then

38
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,118
using a calculator it'll tell you how

39
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,720
much time you need to have to reach that

40
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,840
18 moles the way that I like to do it

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,798
that's a little more simple and doesn't

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,359
require a calculator is to just kind of

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
take the DLI meter and leave it there

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,959
and then come back tomorrow and I can

45
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,158
scroll through the data from yesterday

46
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:44,239
and yesterday it says I had 20 moles

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,960
over the photo period of 13 hours so

48
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:50,438
check I've got it over 6 hours and check

49
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,319
I'm over 18 moles once we know that our

50
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,599
plants have got that DLI requirement

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,038
meant we know that they're happy unlike

52
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,679
the sun outside this light is not free

53
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,439
and depending on the size and the scale

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,439
of your operation these power

55
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,718
requirements can really start to add up

56
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,319
that's why this di meter is so important

57
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,280
this meter can tell you when your

58
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,120
lighting requirements have been met

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,439
here's a few more ways that monitoring

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,080
DLI can help your plants grow their best

61
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,840
sometimes plants need more or less light

62
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,160
at certain stages as they grow by being

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,360
able to closely monitor that amount of

64
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,479
light you can increase the quality and

65
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,120
the yield of your crops if you have a

66
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,959
greenhouse and you're not getting the

67
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,840
light that you need for your plants to

68
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,759
grow you can use a grow light to

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,159
supplement the light that they need so

70
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,120
that way your plants can grow their best

71
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,079
changes in data can act as a canary in

72
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,360
the coal mine for determining larger

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
problems such as fixture failure or

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,239
power outages in the end this meter is

75
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,318
about telling you how much light your

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
plants are getting and when your plants

77
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,479
get enough light you can turn the lights

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,480
off and that saves you

79
00:02:53,479 --> 00:03:00,159
money to learn more about our DLI meter
