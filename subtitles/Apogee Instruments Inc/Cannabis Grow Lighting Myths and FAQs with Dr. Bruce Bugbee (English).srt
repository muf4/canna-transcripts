00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:11,724
I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments, and also professor of Crop Physiology at Utah State University.

2
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:20,310
In this video today, we're going to talk about the basics of lighting as it applies to cannabis.

3
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:32,341
This is profoundly misunderstood. The database is filled with a lot of myths that we have studied over the past year.

4
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,261
And so we're calling this Cannabis 101.

5
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:41,214
This first part of the series is just focused on lighting, which is one of the key parameters.

6
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:49,983
Apogee has spent decades refining instruments to quantify light, the types of light, the intensities of light.

7
00:00:49,984 --> 00:01:00,651
In my experience, those instruments are underutilized to help refine the cultivation of cannabis,

8
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:06,680
and part of it is just because people don't know how to interpret the data and how to make the measurements.

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,694
As a company, Apogee Instruments' motto is “we help people make measurements.”

10
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:22,377
And part of that is our ongoing education to help people interpret the data that they get, make sure the measurements are high quality.

11
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:27,415
And that's what this video is about, with a focus on cannabis.

12
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:35,018
We're not focused on all the other crops, like lettuce that's grown under electric lights. Just cannabis.

13
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:47,875
Utah State University is one of the few agricultural universities that now has a license to study hemp at the university.

14
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:53,164
And when I say cannabis, I mean both hemp and marijuana.

15
00:01:53,164 --> 00:02:00,468
Our license isn't for marijuana. It's only for hemp. But the studies apply to both types of cannabis.

16
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:05,234
So I’m going to talk about cannabis in this video.

17
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:15,926
So, it’s pretty hard to underemphasize the importance of light when you’re growing a crop.

18
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:23,366
And this next slide, which I've used many times in many talks, really focuses on that.

19
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:33,907
Here's the nine cardinal parameters. If you were to take a university class, you would be reviewing each of these parameters.

20
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:45,544
Four of the parameters are in the foliar environment: temperature, humidity, air velocity or wind, and carbon dioxide.

21
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:51,640
Four are in the root zone environment: we have temperature down there, amount of water, nutrients, and oxygen.

22
00:02:51,639 --> 00:03:03,899
We teach whole classes on each one of these parameters, and we may do a series on cannabis on each one of these parameters.

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,745
But today we're going to focus on the one that is absolutely critical, and that's light.

24
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:24,467
And we put this right at the top—let's see if we can get this back, and then let's go to pen tool—there. There we go.

25
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:29,971
Light—and let's see if we can get that yellow to emphasize the light.

26
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:42,621
Light is coming in from all directions on this plant and it drives the optimum levels of everything else.

27
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:49,417
If you turn the light up, you have to give the plants more water because it drives the flux of water through the plant.

28
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:56,721
I should have drawn this in yellow or in blue for water flux through the plants.

29
00:03:56,721 --> 00:04:03,447
You turn the light up, you need more nutrients, you need more oxygen in the root zone. It drives everything.

30
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:14,704
So often we get questions from people saying, “My light must be too high. My plants are turning yellow, or purple, or some color.”

31
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:21,567
What it really is is an imbalance between the amount of light and the optimum levels of all these things.

32
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:27,560
It's like a race car. Cannabis is a race car that can go incredibly fast.

33
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,098
If everything is optimum, you can give cannabis exceptionally high levels of light.

34
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:42,483
And I'm going to go into how we measure that and quantify it. If all of these other parameters are also optimum.

35
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:52,534
If you give it more light and you don't have the right nutrient balance, or the right water, or you don't have elevated CO₂, you're going to have problems with the plant.

36
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:58,381
But it's not fundamentally caused by the light. It's caused by inadequate levels of the other parameters.

37
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:08,948
It'd be like a race car. You've got a giant engine, you're out at the Utah Bonneville Salt Flats, you're going 700 miles an hour, and the tires blow on the car.

38
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,852
And you say, "Ah dang it! The engine was too big."

39
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:16,365
No the engine wasn't too big! You didn't have the right tires for that big of an engine.

40
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:21,771
That's the analogy of how important it is to get the lighting right.

41
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:29,250
So, let's start with how we even measure light.

42
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:41,462
So many people say, "How much light do I need?" And they'll say, "Oh, keep your plants about 30 centimeters, about a foot, away from the lights."

43
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:47,075
Let me show you how bad that is as a measurement of light.

44
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:55,875
And in order to do this, we have set up—here in the Apogee studio—two lights of different wattages.

45
00:05:55,875 --> 00:06:00,774
And I'm going to do a demonstration now to show you how important that is.

46
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:07,257
So I’ve got to step over here and plug the light in.

47
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:10,766
Wheel this in.

48
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:18,706
Now, here's two lights. Let's get them right in the screen.

49
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:25,076
Two different wattages of lights. They’re both LEDs. I could turn them toward the screen, it'd be incredibly good.

50
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:34,519
Now we've set this up so we can measure—if I can do this—right there.

51
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:42,314
We can measure the intensity of the light from these. Here's the number right here. We’ll get into what this means in just a second.

52
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:51,755
But it's 27 µmols of photons—now, that's the light from the studio. If I put this over here, 7 µmols.

53
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:58,790
Now 7 µmols is plenty of light for humans to work in. A well-lit office has 7 µmols.

54
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,254
That is way too low to grow cannabis.

55
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:12,550
You can tell these are a little brighter. What if we said it's 7 µmols here, how bright is it over here? Oh it might be 50 µmols over here.

56
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:20,961
Let's take a look. We're going to go under this light. Now let's see if we can do this. Can you see the screen? I think you can.

57
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:25,605
I'm going to hold this right here about a foot away.

58
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:29,993
You see the number we're getting? 300 µmols.

59
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:40,672
A well-lit office is 7 to 10 µmols and this is 300 µmols? And it looks a little brighter, but it doesn't look 20 or 30 times as bright.

60
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:42,883
It's much, much brighter.

61
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:50,858
That's a foot away. What if that was our measure for cannabis, and we say here's another light, let's go a foot away?

62
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:58,111
Now we put it under this light. Look at this. I got to get it centered.

63
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,316
3,000 µmols.

64
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:14,204
Depends on exactly how far away, but we're approaching 3,000 µmols. If I go a hair closer there it is, 3,000 µmols under this light.

65
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:20,433
And we go under this light. Same distance. We're down around 300 µmols.

66
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:32,370
That is almost an order of magnitude more photons under one light than the other, and the only difference is the input wattage.

67
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,557
This is a low input wattage. This is a high input wattage. It's not color of light, it’s input wattage.

68
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:50,480
So I hope you can see that just saying "Put your plants some distance away from the lights" is a very inadequate way to precisely grow cannabis.

69
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,735
You've got to have a meter. Our eyes are one of the worst meters for plants.

70
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:07,634
Our pupils contract to reduce the amount of light getting to our retina in bright light.

71
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:17,860
So we're a terrible light meter in terms of intuitive estimating of light. We really need an instrument to measure it.

72
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,950
So this is a demo of the fact that you can't do that.

73
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:31,739
Now remember that number. Let's take 300 µmols, and how much cannabis could we grow with that?

74
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:37,211
Now I'm going to stop here and take these out of the way so we can interpret the data.

75
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:45,143
Now we're back with a white screen that we can take a look at what we just measured.

76
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:59,865
So, first of all, let’s draw what we call a light response curve for plants in general, and then we'll draw a light response curve for cannabis.

77
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:11,514
So, as students in my classes know, over the years I draw a lot of XY plots to take an input variable here and look at response.

78
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:20,661
So what we're going to put over here is Pn. This stands for net photosynthesis.

79
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:33,479
And over here we're going to put PPFD: Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density. That's what we just measured with that Apogee meter.

80
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,308
This graph starts at zero here and zero here.

81
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:51,980
If this was Introduction to Plant Science and we asked this question, everyone would say, "Well, of course, light, or photon flux, drives photosynthesis."

82
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,139
So that curve is going to look like that.

83
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:03,250
And if this was Plant Science 101, we would count that as a correct answer.

84
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:13,678
But if it's a more advanced class, we know that the higher the light, this doesn't keep going up forever.

85
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:21,501
Plants can't keep using all those photons. So a more correct answer looks like this.

86
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:29,301
And we can even erase this top incorrect answer and go back to this.

87
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:33,591
There's a more correct answer because it levels off at high light.

88
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:44,721
Now notice I didn't put any tick marks on here yet, because we just measured 300 µmols and almost 3,000 µmols out of that other light.

89
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:54,120
But there's one more thing that makes this curve even more accurate, and I'll put that in blue.

90
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:02,388
If you take a plant and put it in the dark, it gradually respires and dies.

91
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,041
You can't keep it in the dark for weeks or months.

92
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:18,408
So this line doesn't go through zero right there. In the dark, we get a negative number. The plant is shrinking. It's dying.

93
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:24,586
And we turn on the lights, and it goes like this.

94
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:30,293
So there's some point right here where there's just enough light to keep the plant alive.

95
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:37,452
This, by the way, is called the "light compensation point" when there's enough light to get it to zero.

96
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:50,478
Now let's put some tick marks on this axis. Photosynthesis—let's make this go to 60 up here.

97
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:59,624
Now the units for this are µmols per m² of leaf per second of time.

98
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:03,714
This is how fast it's fixing carbon and dry weight.

99
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,207
Now let's put some tick marks on this.

100
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:16,421
If we go up to here, what's full sunlight? If we went outside in the summer at noon, what would we get for high light?

101
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:24,883
We would get 2,000. That's an important reference point, 2,000.

102
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:35,478
These units are µmols of photons per m² per second.

103
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:44,397
And this over here could be just yield of the plants, but these are the units that we’re measuring to get the light.

104
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:54,561
Now if that's 2,000, 1,000 is right here, and 500 is right here.

105
00:13:55,201 --> 00:14:03,350
The way I drew this graph, wow. We have to have 400 µmols just to get above zero.

106
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,829
Now this only happens in a dense crop.

107
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:21,674
But let me see if I can erase these lines, and I'm going to draw two lines on here.

108
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:27,529
Let's go back to green. We're going to fill this back in.

109
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,846
Here's our green. There's 500. Now let's go to blue.

110
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:39,576
If we did these measurements for lettuce. Lettuce is a widely grown crop, very widely studied.

111
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:48,152
It is also a low light plant. Lettuce grows fine in much lower light than cannabis.

112
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:59,856
So if we draw a curve for lettuce, first of all it starts here. It goes up, and at about 500 µmols lettuce is done.

113
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:06,404
And it might even go down out here with really high light. This is lettuce.

114
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:15,520
There. Now what if we put cannabis on here?

115
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:26,759
Cannabis is life in the fast lane. It takes a lot of light. You can grow cannabis much faster. We're going to put cannabis in red.

116
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:36,153
First of all, it doesn't really have a low gear. It has a high respiration rate. Cannabis looks something like this.

117
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:42,980
Look at this curve! Look at that curve! Wow! This is cannabis.

118
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:54,862
It keeps going up until 2,000 µmols. So cannabis is a very high-light crop.

119
00:15:54,863 --> 00:16:01,849
You can give it a lot of light, but you've got to have all the other inputs optimized.

120
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:12,139
For sure, you need elevated CO₂ for cannabis and ample water. It's usually automated watering.

121
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:18,115
It's a balanced nutrient solution. That's a topic of a whole other talk.

122
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:25,875
But our data don't indicate cannabis needs unusual nutrients, but it needs a balanced nutrients. And not too much.

123
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,848
Usually there's toxicities from too much nutrients.

124
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:36,934
And if you have this high of light, and the water is going through the plant that fast, you have to be careful not to have too much nutrients.

125
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:40,406
But the point is, look at cannabis.

126
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:45,857
Corn is like this, too. Corn is a very high-light field crop.

127
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:49,591
So now we get a meter to measure this.

128
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:58,081
And if the leaves are green, we're using the photons efficiently, and we have high photosynthetic rates.

129
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:06,230
Let's take a look on this now. A closer look at this unit down here.

130
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,122
This is generally a widely used unit, but it's not universal.

131
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:18,182
And let's take a look at this. And I can do that on the next screen.

132
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:21,716
Now let's go back to green.

133
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:40,050
Multiple acronyms are used to measure light. And the most common one is P-A-R and that stands for Photosynthetically Active Radiation.

134
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:50,081
Let's go to a slightly smaller line size—that's a pretty fat line.

135
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:53,151
All right. Now we've got a PAR.

136
00:17:53,151 --> 00:18:01,484
This is a generic term for all photosynthetically active radiation. But it could mean watts per meter², and that's confusing.

137
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:14,943
So a more rigorous term is P-P-F-D. That stands for Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density.

138
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:22,326
And this always means that number from the previous one, moles of photons.

139
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:30,000
And you think of photons as like tiny little marbles falling out of the sky to fill a box. They can be colored marbles, but they're all marbles.

140
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,201
We're measuring this flux of photons coming into the plant.

141
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:43,771
Per meter² per unit area of a surface area per unit time, and we always use per second.

142
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:56,090
That's the unit for PPFD. Now this is a big number. A mole. And so it's really a µmol. Ten to the minus six moles per second.

143
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:05,307
And this number ranges, we just showed that in the other slide. Zero up to 2,000 µmols. It's a huge range.

144
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:14,826
Remember those lights we measured? One was 300 µmols. One was over 3,000 µmols because it was a high wattage light and we're real close to it.

145
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:25,470
These are the keys. Now we'll come back to this later, but PPFD is the number that we’re after here for light.

146
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,399
Now let's go to another screen.

147
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:36,634
We're going to take our same screen here.

148
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:45,265
And we had PPFD. Zero µmols. Let's go all the way to 2,000 µmols.

149
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:51,524
This is very bright light. We rarely get this high of light under electric lights, but we could.

150
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:56,415
And over here we're just going to put yield.

151
00:19:56,971 --> 00:20:03,056
Not photosynthesis anymore because photosynthesis leads to yield.

152
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:11,127
How much light is necessary? What's really key about this is not the instantaneous light.

153
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:15,342
We're going to put our graph on here again.

154
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:24,833
Something like this. The exact shape varies with different cultivars, but it doesn't vary very much.

155
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:37,697
It turns out it's not exactly the PPFD, it is the DLI. Daily Light Integral.

156
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:48,205
So as this implies, an integral means we add up all of the photons. This is per second and every second we accumulate them.

157
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:54,615
What if this was rainfall? PPFD would tell us the rate. How fast is it raining per second?

158
00:20:54,615 --> 00:21:00,686
But usually what we want to know is how much did it rain yesterday? The total amount of rain.

159
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:05,982
And that's the Daily Light Integral called DLI.

160
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:11,415
Let me show you how to convert. Once you see this you'll know it forever.

161
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:16,979
Let's put 1,000 in here.

162
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:21,203
We're going to convert from PPFD to DLI.

163
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:32,518
1,000 µmols per m² per second.

164
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:44,860
Now we want to know per day. Well there's 3,600 seconds per hour. So this is 3.6.

165
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:59,810
Now notice, this is 1,000 and that's 3,000, and when you multiply these together, the thousands cancel. And this is 3.6 moles.

166
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:05,471
Now no micro anymore because we just multiplied two big numbers together.

167
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:15,471
3.6 moles per m². Now this is per hour. We're still not there. That's per hour.

168
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:29,638
For cannabis, when it's in the flowering stage, we would typically give it 12 hours per day.

169
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:39,306
Multiply these two together: 3.6 and 12. I know this because I've done it so many times.

170
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:50,646
That comes out to be 43.2 moles per m² per day.

171
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:58,829
And that number right there—this is so important, we'll put it in red—is the DLI.

172
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:09,560
If you had 1,000 µmols per second continuously for 12 hours, you get 43 a day.

173
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:17,524
This is high light, but cannabis responds to this. In our studies, we can push them even higher than this.

174
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:28,252
We've never gone to 2,000 µmols, but we've gone close to it. We've gone to 1,800 µmols up to where we've gotten this number close to 60.

175
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:42,363
Outside in the summer under full sunlight on sunny days, DLI can get to 60 moles per m² per day. That's an incredible DLI.

176
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:47,142
Cannabis grows outside in full sunlight, and it loves it. It responds to it.

177
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:52,352
So you can run the DLI up extremely high. Now how low can you go?

178
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:58,042
Well here would be 500 µmols. And you see the point here.

179
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:05,144
There's some diminishing returns. The line still goes up, but it's curving over.

180
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:16,953
So 2,000 µmols doesn't give us twice the yield of 1,000 µmols, but it's still higher. So we keep raising this—here would be 500 µmols right here.

181
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:26,828
But the point is, you’ve got to know this input to have reproducible studies. And to get it, you need to measure it.

182
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:34,085
Let's take a second to review some of the instruments that Apogee uses.

183
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:41,373
All of them are a little sensor. Here the quantum sensor is blue. That's the one we used a minute ago to measure these.

184
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:50,107
This one plugs right into a laptop. Here's a USB cable, and you can plug right in.

185
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:58,117
You’ve got to remember to take the cap off of these. The optics here are really rugged, but we still ship them with the cap to keep them perfect.

186
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:02,678
Plug this right into a laptop, just like I did, and you'll see the numbers on the screen.

187
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:10,518
If you want something more portable, here is a handheld meter with a separate sensor.

188
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:15,726
These also come with the sensor right in it. That's another option.

189
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:26,025
And one of the options that's big and catching on fast is Bluetooth. This is a Bluetooth module. It’s like a datalogger.

190
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:33,179
It measures and stores the data, and then you just transmit this data right to your cell phone.

191
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:40,561
So this is a powerful option and there's plenty of graphics associated with this for measuring the light.

192
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,659
All of them go to this sensor.

193
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:53,008
If you jump up another level, this gold cube is a spectroradiometer, which gives you all the ratios of colors.

194
00:25:53,008 --> 00:26:00,792
But these other instruments are down in a few hundred dollars. This instrument is over $2,000.

195
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:09,165
This is much more sophisticated, but this is what researchers use to get everything exactly right in all of these.

196
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:18,330
So we get questions all the time on issues relating to light.

197
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:24,285
And I just addressed one of them: daily light integral.

198
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:36,741
We can push daily light integral easily to 30, to 40, to 50. And the yield keeps going up if everything's optimal.

199
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:45,914
In terms of how much light it tolerates, this is true even for young seedlings.

200
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:58,181
One of our research projects right now is to push the rooting of cuttings of cannabis with very high light. This just sounds amazing.

201
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:03,832
But for years and years we keep plants in really low light with cuttings because they didn't have any roots.

202
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:09,486
We're finding if we can keep them watered, we can even push a cutting with very high light levels.

203
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:13,111
And certainly a young plant. You can push them hard with high light.

204
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:18,995
Again, as long as the other inputs are not limiting growth.

205
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:23,440
What about darkness?

206
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:31,218
Let's go to another screen. Another topic. We'll put this one in blue.

207
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:38,414
Now we're going to do hours per day.

208
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:49,726
It's a different graph. Hours. Here's noon. Here's midnight.

209
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:53,227
And here's midnight.

210
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:57,875
And, of course, here's PPFD.

211
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:07,888
We have no evidence that suddenly turning on the light shocks the plants. They can get out of bed and go right to work. They don't need to ramp up slowly.

212
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:17,883
But let's say we turn on the lights at 6:00 AM. We run them high until 10:00 PM.

213
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:23,046
This would be 16 hours of light.

214
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:39,941
Now if we're in flowering phase—let's go back to red—if we're in flowering phase, we might run them from 8 AM to 8 PM like this.

215
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:43,927
And this is a 12-hour photoperiod.

216
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:47,049
So there's really just two photoperiods for cannabis.

217
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:56,695
A 16, and even an 18 hour, photoperiod for veg. And in fact some of our data indicates this could even be 24 hours for veg.

218
00:28:56,695 --> 00:29:03,841
Just get the plants growing with a high DLI. And then when we want them to flower, we switch to 12.

219
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:10,204
Now, here's the question. So this is all fine. What about right here?

220
00:29:10,203 --> 00:29:19,796
This number right here is darkness. How dark does it have to be for cannabis at night?

221
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:26,455
This is something we're actively studying right now in my laboratory at the University.

222
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:35,196
There are some literature reports that indicate that cannabis is exquisitely sensitive to trace amounts of light pollution.

223
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:40,002
Just a little bit of light will cause problems with cannabis.

224
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:47,816
We have a wealth of literature on poinsettias. They're one of our most sensitive crops to light pollution.

225
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:56,986
Without excellent darkness, those top leaves of cannabis don't turn red. They're called Brax. They don't turn red.

226
00:29:56,986 --> 00:30:06,782
Is cannabis more sensitive than poinsettias? We don't know yet, but we know it needs to be very dark.

227
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:12,000
We call this reagent grade darkness, and it's like somebody sleeping.

228
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,490
Some people are bothered by a tiny light when they sleep and for other people it doesn’t matter.

229
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,493
But we think cannabis is quite sensitive to this.

230
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:34,128
For this reason, Apogee has made an extended range quantum sensor that’s calibrated to rigorously measure light pollution.

231
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:40,793
Now remember we were doing µmols per m² per second and we're getting numbers in the hundreds?

232
00:30:40,794 --> 00:30:52,005
This particular sensor can measure 0.01 µmols per meter m² per second.

233
00:30:52,005 --> 00:31:00,118
It's a unique meter that can detect trace amounts of light. And it helps you determine whether it's absolutely dark.

234
00:31:00,117 --> 00:31:10,562
It's an extended range sensor. It even picks up the photons from security cameras, which there's possibilities for those to affect cannabis.

235
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:13,277
That's a topic for another video.

236
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:18,652
So extended range quantum sensor for light pollution studies.

237
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:26,760
This is getting down around full moonlight, and we know that full moonlight doesn't affect cannabis or any other plants.

238
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,122
But it might not take much more of that to be a big deal.

239
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:36,596
Let's talk about cultivars. Differences.

240
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:46,024
Many people say, "Gee, this happened in one, and something else happened in another." We have an emerging number of different cultivars for cannabis.

241
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:54,108
As you probably know if you're watching this video, I won't write them up here. They're all cannabis sativa.

242
00:31:54,108 --> 00:32:02,019
And underneath that we have indica and sativa. So it's cannabis sativa sativa.

243
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:09,671
Our studies at the University indicate there's definitely differences in those. Leaf width. Leaf size.

244
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:18,875
But in terms of response to all these parameters I'm talking about, there's not a significant difference between the types.

245
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:27,727
You can push both types of cannabis with high light. They both love high light. They both evolved out in the field.

246
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:32,971
The differences can be in yield. They can be in photoperiod sensitivity.

247
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:40,958
Some cultivars of cannabis we think can take 13 hours of light over here. Some might be able to take 14.

248
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:46,132
But in terms of pushing them with high light, they're all similar.

249
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:50,007
Let's think about some of the other cultivars.

250
00:32:50,007 --> 00:33:03,916
Some of the other questions we get include: what about light quality and the synthesis of what we call cannabinoid compounds?

251
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:10,676
That's THC, CBD, CBN, CBG, all the different cannabinoid combos.

252
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:14,357
Then in another class of compounds, there's terpenes.

253
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:21,967
What about light quality? And it could be a whole other talk, and I have given other talks on this.

254
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:30,508
They’re in other videos on the Apogee website. So if you're interested in this, look for other videos on this.

255
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:44,917
Here's the take home message. We don't have evidence that changing the colors of light makes a significant difference on cannabinoid synthesis.

256
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:48,205
Let me say that again, this is an amazing statement.

257
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:54,968
Light quality does not have a huge effect on the ratios of cannabinoids.

258
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:59,526
This is in spite of many people claiming it does.

259
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:05,238
Our data in general don't support that there's big effects.

260
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:09,474
I didn't say there was none. We just don't see big effects.

261
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:17,376
We're still actively studying that, and stay tuned because we're looking at all kinds of different ratios.

262
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:27,735
Now, let me conclude on one part of light that is enormously important.

263
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:32,885
And we're going to go to a new screen. Last slide.

264
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:40,015
I don't like to draw those. I’m going to draw the axes in blue.

265
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:47,018
This is 400 to 700 nm.

266
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,315
And this is the wavelength of light.

267
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:55,833
If you're going to get a degree—an honorary degree—in cannabis science, you got to memorize these two numbers.

268
00:34:55,833 --> 00:35:02,293
We use lambda to express this. And the unit here is nanometers.

269
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:10,455
So this is colors of light. This is what you would use this spectroradiometer to measure.

270
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:13,447
So I think most people know, but let's review this.

271
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:25,673
Right here if we do 500 and 600 nm. This area right here, 400 to 500 nm, is blue.

272
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:36,438
It looks blue to the human eye, and we call that range blue. Now we go to 500 to 600 nm, and that range is green.

273
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:43,481
And now we go to 600 to 700 nm, and that range is red.

274
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:47,311
For many of you this is review, but it's important to have the basics.

275
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:56,324
Alright, photosynthetic radiation stops right here.

276
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:05,397
Our historic and classic definition of this is 400 to 700 nm. Period.

277
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:13,574
If there's a photon at 701 nm, we don't count it. If it's at 399 nm, we don't count it.

278
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:19,970
Is that right? Really? The big chop? No, they don't chop off like that. We've known that for years.

279
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:26,278
This is just a useful approximation of photosynthetic radiation.

280
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:38,525
But, now that we have LEDs that we can fine-tune all these wavelengths, we are re-examining what we have used for half a century.

281
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:41,501
And there's two specific wavelengths that are huge.

282
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:50,994
I think I'm still on red. Right here—no let's go to red—right here this is far-red.

283
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:56,739
If I can get that up here—FR. Rar-red. Now we're going to look at far-red.

284
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:02,768
And that is out here to 750 nm. This zone right here.

285
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:12,567
Our eyes have trouble seeing this. It's just like a dull glow of a red burner on a stove of an electric burner.

286
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:21,403
You couldn't read a book by this. But it has powerful effects on plants and it adds 750 nm.

287
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:29,438
Our data indicate that these photons cause photosynthesis. They certainly cause changes in plant shape.

288
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:35,335
We can make plants branch more. We usually make them taller with more far-red.

289
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:44,543
But these photons are critical. Because of that—well before I get to that—let's talk about the other end down here—blue.

290
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:53,542
These photons, especially 350-300 nm. This of course is all ultraviolet.

291
00:37:53,543 --> 00:38:00,651
Our eyes don't see this. Historically electric lights we try to get rid of this. We try to get rid of this.

292
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:11,844
They're not useful for human lighting, but they have powerful effects on plants. Especially this region at 350 nm right here of UV.

293
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:16,949
Our data indicate these photons cause photosynthesis as well.

294
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:26,444
So I think we're going to see an emerging change in the definition of photosynthetic radiation, maybe from 350 to 750 nm.

295
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:38,113
We'll see. Multiple laboratories are studying this. Because of this, Apogee has come out with what we call an extended range quantum sensor.

296
00:38:38,112 --> 00:38:44,681
And that is a sensor that measures everything from 350 nm way out here.

297
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:52,856
It picks up—here’s security cameras, they have a big peak out here that's centered around 830 nm.

298
00:38:52,856 --> 00:39:00,242
That extended range picks up all these photons. And for some kinds of lights these photons are critical.

299
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:05,991
You want to know what they are. Even though the classic quantum sensor doesn't include them,

300
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:12,344
the Apogee extended range quantum sensor does include them.

301
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:22,132
So UV photons have the potential to reduce disease in plants. They have the potential to trigger cannabinoid synthesis in plants.

302
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:32,000
So we're putting a lot of energy into studying the potential use of UV photons in plants. Again stay tuned.

303
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:43,260
And one more thing, we get a lot of questions about optimum ratios of colors for both growth and photosynthesis and for cannabinoids.

304
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:53,328
And let me fall back on the one principle here that has guided us, and that's the percent blue photons.

305
00:39:53,327 --> 00:40:01,177
And let's do this in a different screen, here's my marker.

306
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:24,143
For years, before we had LEDs, people said you want to do metal halide for veg before they became reproductive.

307
00:40:24,143 --> 00:40:32,768
And you would typically be giving maybe even an 18 hour photo period during that time. During veg.

308
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:50,641
Then the prevailing wisdom was to switch to high pressure sodium during the reproductive phase. And that's flowering.

309
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:59,892
Now many people said, "Oh that's all a myth." Not exactly.

310
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:13,556
Metal halide has 30% blue photons.

311
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:19,375
This is having trouble—30% blue.

312
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:25,121
The higher the blue photons, the more compact the plant.

313
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:30,569
So metal halide was very effective at making nice, compact plants.

314
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:41,219
High pressure sodium, on the other hand, only has about 4% blue photons.

315
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:44,432
Sunlight has about 30% blue.

316
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:51,628
They switch to high pressure sodium because it's a much more efficient light, and you can get bright intensity. But it had low blue.

317
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:57,240
But the blue didn't matter so much during flowering because the flowers kept the plants short.

318
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:08,355
So there was a reason to go with a high blue light during veg and then a very efficient light during flowering.

319
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:18,594
And we've seen that in cannabis. It's a ratio of blue photons for plant height and then the efficiency of the light after that.

320
00:42:18,594 --> 00:42:24,971
So what we like to see are very efficient lights.

321
00:42:24,971 --> 00:42:37,320
The ratios of colors are less critical. We do like to see lights with enough green photons so you can diagnose plant disorders.

322
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,008
Those green photons usually come from white LEDs.

323
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:48,727
It's important to look for microscopic insects. Subtle disorders. You’ve got to be able to see the plants to do that.

324
00:42:48,728 --> 00:42:52,896
But after that, it’s just the efficiency of the light.

325
00:42:52,896 --> 00:43:02,353
If you search for design light consortium on the internet, the acronym is DLC.

326
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:11,063
That is an independent company that has now been listing many lights from many manufacturers

327
00:43:11,063 --> 00:43:18,844
and their test results from independent test laboratories for the efficiency of the light.

328
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:37,722
The unit for light efficiency—and I'm running out of room—is µmols of photons out per Joule of electricity in.

329
00:43:37,722 --> 00:43:45,947
The really efficient lights, LEDs, are now getting up to 2.5 µmols per Joule and even higher than that.

330
00:43:45,947 --> 00:43:53,932
They're incredibly efficient. Ten years ago, we were half of that efficiency for lights.

331
00:43:53,931 --> 00:44:03,140
But it's critical to get an efficient light and a broad spectrum light so you got enough colors to see the plants.

332
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,989
Thanks for listening.
