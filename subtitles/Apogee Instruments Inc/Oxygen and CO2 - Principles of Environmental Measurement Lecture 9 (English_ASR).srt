[Music]

2
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:27,198
because now we're talking about not

3
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:31,308
radiation or wind or reflectance but a

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:36,058
measurement of gases in the air and

5
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:38,910
particularly oxygen and this is so

6
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,679
powerful because gases are used to

7
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:46,709
measure metabolic rates of bacteria of

8
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:49,939
plants of people and particularly of

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,289
course oxygen and co2 we measure

10
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:57,359
photosynthesis with by measuring co2

11
00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:01,230
changes but oxygen also changes and

12
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:06,329
oxygen sensors are far cheaper than co2

13
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:10,920
sensors so we have four sometimes sold

14
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:13,140
this oxygen sensor and this is a picture

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,868
of what it looks like buried in soils

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,439
one of the common applications putting

17
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:23,009
it in soil to measure soil gas

18
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,289
concentration obviously if a plant is

19
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,989
growing and it's healthy and it's

20
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,650
consuming oxygen in the soil the oxygen

21
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,750
goes down in the soil so number one we

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,368
want to understand how low that is but

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,879
number two the rate at which it goes

24
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:41,400
down helps us tell the respiration rate

25
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,188
of the root system of the plant which

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,240
tells us something about health of the

27
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:54,899
plant so it's both to monitor oxygen and

28
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:57,560
to do metabolic rate studies this sensor

29
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,320
fundamentally it's a galvanic cell

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,560
sensor so it causes a chemical reaction

31
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,379
with the oxygen gas which creates a tiny

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,560
voltage and it's measured by a data

33
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,049
logger so that's the general physics of

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,189
the signal transduction of this

35
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:21,280
changing of the gas it has a screen on

36
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:24,219
the end I don't know if we have a oxygen

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,890
sensor here Peter do you know if we have

38
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:30,550
an oxygen sensor here we could pass one

39
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:32,469
around that's a and it that helps keep

40
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,500
the water away from the sensing tip but

41
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:40,569
also to measure a bigger volume of soil

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,949
these are a few hundred dollars I mean I

43
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,509
can't remember the exact price but

44
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:45,489
they're not thousands so that means

45
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:48,969
they're much more accessible to many

46
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,330
more people to have multiple sensors I

47
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:55,030
think I have a couple example pictures

48
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,540
of this and then I want to talk about

49
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,099
how they work here's one application in

50
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:03,879
the lab we've used this quite a bit in

51
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:06,310
my lab there's a petri dish sealed the

52
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,439
tip drill it drill a tiny hole put the

53
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,949
sensor in there and we're measuring the

54
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,960
change in oxygen in this petri dish

55
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:17,259
which is an indication of the metabolic

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,390
rate of these seats at real sensitive of

57
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:21,280
this there's another one in a jar drill

58
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:25,509
a hole put the sensor in the top now in

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,669
this jar there's no respiration going on

60
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:30,189
it's clear water it's not it's

61
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:31,929
metabolically inert but if we run the

62
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:34,719
temperature up and down we would like to

63
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,879
get zeros in that jar and all kinds of

64
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,000
things are changing that humidity in the

65
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,280
jar is changing which dilutes the oxygen

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,889
but we want to make the appropriate

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,259
correction factors so we can get a clean

68
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:50,019
zero in a jar where the really isn't any

69
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:53,500
respiration so this is a laboratory use

70
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:58,570
of this but it also has a similar uses

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:01,379
in the field just a review I'd love to

72
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:04,239
show this equation this is the health

73
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,879
students this is the most important

74
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,930
equation in the world to a biologist

75
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,430
this is respiration going this way and

76
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,239
photosynthesis going this way and if we

77
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:19,480
can measure the rate of oxygen depletion

78
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,060
or the rate of co2 build-up we know the

79
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,479
metabolic rate and that's as simple as

80
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,589
that

81
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:29,649
one mole of oxygen disappearing

82
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:32,709
one mole of carbon has been metabolized

83
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:36,159
in respiration so we can precisely

84
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:40,120
calculate metabolism and you can do that

85
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,139
with either oxygen or co2 first up

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,730
background of oxygen is much higher

87
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,769
there's a this is a picture of it with

88
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:52,930
the meter and the sensor on the end so

89
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:55,959
now to come full circle and the very

90
00:04:52,930 --> 00:05:00,340
first talk I talked about relative and

91
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:05,349
absolute humidity that's a water vapor

92
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:09,009
in air that same principle applies to

93
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:11,410
all the gases in air we have relative

94
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:14,949
measurements which are listed here and

95
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:19,240
we have absolute units listed on the

96
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:22,029
other side relative not surprisingly its

97
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,150
percent the same is exact concept is

98
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:28,388
relative humidity we can call that mole

99
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:30,519
fraction the pressure of oxygen divided

100
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:33,750
by total pressure parts per million

101
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:37,509
another measure the same thing but in

102
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:40,750
this case in the case of humidity the

103
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:43,750
sensors measure relative units and we

104
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,660
calculated absolute units in this case

105
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:52,350
the sensor is measuring the absolute

106
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,350
units and we convert to relative units

107
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:01,690
but these Conte's units are exactly the

108
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:05,259
same the moles or mass of the gas per

109
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:08,860
unit volume so let me go through a

110
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:13,990
couple of examples of how this affects

111
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:16,990
us now this all comes from what we all

112
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,900
learned in even high school chemistry PV

113
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,569
equals NRT pressure and volume equals

114
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:25,149
the moles times ideal gas constant times

115
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:27,579
absolute temperature and if you're

116
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:30,638
making these measurements you get good

117
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:33,490
at making those conversions so you can

118
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,639
calculate metabolic rate here's the

119
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,439
sensors respond to absolute and

120
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,589
recalibrate and

121
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,199
two parametric pressure affects the

122
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:46,679
concentration of gas in the air it's

123
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,300
easy to measure pressure and easy to

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,340
measure it electronically I'm not going

125
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,400
to talk about her sensor but it easy to

126
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:56,369
measure it if the pressure changes and

127
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,649
gets higher pressure that gas gets more

128
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,689
dense and you conclude that there's

129
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:03,659
respiration but there's not it's it's a

130
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,079
change in pressure here's a great way to

131
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,650
show it

132
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,569
elevation barometric pressure is the red

133
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:12,500
line as we go up the top of Mount

134
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:16,170
Everest and the unit over here is

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:20,310
concentration of gas now there's another

136
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:23,460
test question so we know virtually

137
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:27,209
everybody needs compressed oxygen to

138
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:29,069
climb Mount Everest what's the percent

139
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:32,310
the percent oxygen at sea level is

140
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:34,439
twenty point nine five percent what's

141
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:40,199
the percent oxygen on the top of Mount

142
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:41,850
Everest it's exactly the same so if it's

143
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,219
just twenty point nine percent why we

144
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,340
need oxygen well low pressure the

145
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,790
density of oxygen molecules is way less

146
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,519
and that's an example of the correction

147
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:56,189
for pressure so when we're measuring

148
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,949
this we often measure pressure with it

149
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:03,918
so we can correct for differences in

150
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:06,569
pressure and sort out metabolism from

151
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,849
everything else pressure doesn't change

152
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,860
that much high pressure front slow

153
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,250
pressure fronts this is a high altitude

154
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,350
pressure but still pressure from highs

155
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,199
to lows only changes the density of gas

156
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:22,830
air about one percent and maybe two

157
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,569
percent on extreme events so our our

158
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,909
pressures even though they have a huge

159
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:31,560
effect on our weather only have a small

160
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:34,200
effect on the density of gas but we

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,940
measure and correct for that so now we

162
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,110
put this sensor in soil and we want to

163
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:45,420
measure the changes in oxygen and soil

164
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:48,899
soil is very close to a hundred percent

165
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,049
humidity all the time because it's all

166
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:56,220
these wet surfaces all

167
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:59,069
in equilibrium with the gas what happens

168
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,149
if you put a sensor in soil like this

169
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,850
it's got it it's a tiny gore-tex

170
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:09,509
membrane that's gas permeable but it

171
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:11,519
doesn't let water into the sensor if you

172
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:14,458
put that in soil and you just leave it

173
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,379
sooner or later it gets condensation on

174
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,569
the membrane because 100 percent

175
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,328
humidity and the soil temperature is

176
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,959
cycling well the sensor stops working

177
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:28,409
that's the membrane is got water on it

178
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:32,759
gas can't come in so we heat the sensor

179
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:35,039
just a little bit just 1 degree C above

180
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,528
background and that prevents

181
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,379
condensation it's not enough to change

182
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:44,458
the metabolism but it is enough to keep

183
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:47,399
the condensation off the sensor the

184
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:52,828
other factors recent water vapors a big

185
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,889
deal is water vapor is maybe three

186
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:57,599
percent of the molecules in the air but

187
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:01,289
as the humidity and temperature go up

188
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,019
and down the oxygen gets diluted these

189
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:06,389
water vapor molecules come in and again

190
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:10,259
it's apparent respiration only because

191
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:12,629
of dilution of the gas and I won't go

192
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,448
through all the details of this but it

193
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:19,230
you have to correct for the temperature

194
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:21,899
of the soil to get the absolute oxygen

195
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,350
concentration and this is happening in

196
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:29,519
the background in software the of the

197
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:32,430
sensor to sort out what fraction of the

198
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,009
change in signal is true metabolism by

199
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:38,399
plant roots and what fraction is just a

200
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:41,759
parent caused by changes in the gas

201
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:48,208
composition obviously if this thing in

202
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:50,818
air and it gave us a 21% and then we put

203
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:53,818
it in a hundred percent humidity it

204
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:57,139
starts to read lower because of all the

205
00:10:53,818 --> 00:11:01,129
oxygen and all the water vapor molecules

206
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:03,899
diluting the oxygen molecules

207
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:06,059
there it is same thing and that's how we

208
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,759
do this test and the corrections for it

209
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:12,629
and finally the third thing is

210
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:15,179
temperature PV NRT this is absolute

211
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,669
Kelvin temperature but as the

212
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,250
temperature goes up and down and also

213
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:25,289
changes the density of the air and the

214
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:28,259
oxygen in the air that's then there's a

215
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:30,559
temperature effect on electronics of the

216
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:34,080
sensor we had a correct floor and then

217
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,909
gas liquid partitioning the amount of

218
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,500
gas and solution and the mount in the

219
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:43,379
air and here's enough the temperature

220
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,610
and the parent change in reading this is

221
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:55,159
at 19 to 22 degrees it's a big effect of

222
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:57,810
temperature and this is also the this

223
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:00,209
written red line is the effect on the

224
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:05,909
electronics and fortunately it's pretty

225
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:07,980
flat in here from about 15 to 35 C but a

226
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:10,799
hot and cold temperatures we need to

227
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,870
correct for temperature temperature

228
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,149
affects almost every single sensor we

229
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,759
have that there's hardly any sensor that

230
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,559
doesn't have some temperature

231
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,210
interaction and we're always measuring

232
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,579
those and correcting for them and

233
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,740
software or trying to build sensors that

234
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,150
are so robust they have a minimal

235
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,149
temperature effect

236
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:38,448
and now couple slides since the final

237
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:40,399
slides I'm going to close with it people

238
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:42,679
have suggested sensors we might build

239
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,379
and as a company we're constantly

240
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:49,099
thinking of what's our next sensor we're

241
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:51,799
gonna work on and what how do we decide

242
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,899
what kind of sensors to work on well

243
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:58,159
I'll tell you it's no it's not brain

244
00:12:53,899 --> 00:13:00,019
surgery how many we gonna sell how many

245
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,328
people would buy a sensor like this if

246
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:05,419
we build it if it's 10 we probably won't

247
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:07,669
build the sensor if it's a hundred then

248
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:10,360
we decide how much R&amp;D will it take to

249
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:13,819
make the first one and it's a ratio of

250
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,699
investment costs for Rd to the number

251
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,910
sold and when that gets favorable we

252
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:23,448
decide to work on the sensor but it's

253
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:25,278
also how much Rd will it take that I

254
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:27,500
don't know mark come along we've been

255
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:33,980
working on that net radiometer I mean we

256
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:36,860
we got it yeah we got a lot of money

257
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,740
invested in making the first one and so

258
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,350
we're just now getting them on the on

259
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,879
the market so you hold your breath as a

260
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,829
company and hope people will buy the

261
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,990
stuff that you build otherwise you're

262
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:49,838
gonna be out of business

263
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,360
here's here's a sensor that we're

264
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,000
looking at we've done some preliminary

265
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,829
testing and I could make a joke and say

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,899
don't tell our competitors about this

267
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:01,519
but even if you told them they'd say

268
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,049
well that's a hard sensor to build we're

269
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,919
not going to make it because it's too

270
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:08,990
much of a risk they there's a lot of R&amp;D

271
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,338
if we can make a sensor in soil that

272
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:15,818
both measures carbon dioxide and oxygen

273
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:19,670
together we can get what's called

274
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:22,818
respiratory quotient and that tells us

275
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:26,870
what materials are being metabolized by

276
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:28,370
the bacteria in the soils and I'll give

277
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,528
you some examples of respiratory

278
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,740
quotient but here's an example of a

279
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:36,649
bucket and some oxygen sensors and a co2

280
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,500
sensor so remember that equation that I

281
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:41,230
might have that yeah there's our

282
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,970
equation

283
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,938
this is when this goes that way this is

284
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:50,360
one that's one that means the

285
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:54,409
respiratory quotient is one but what if

286
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:58,639
the bacteria were metabolizing lignin

287
00:14:54,409 --> 00:15:02,870
and now lignin is ch2 with hardly any

288
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:06,680
oxygen or fats fats hardly have any

289
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:12,318
oxygen substrates change in the ratio of

290
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:14,958
C h2o and that changes the ratio of co2

291
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:17,208
and oxygen and with such a sensor we can

292
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:23,208
tell what's being metabolized in the

293
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:28,729
soil here's a couple there's a

294
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:32,119
background this is the advantage of

295
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,250
measuring co2 they're so little in the

296
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,379
background it's easy to measure a change

297
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,600
I mean this is just point oh four

298
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,430
percent co2 in the air we can easily

299
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,278
measure change this is a huge background

300
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:46,099
so it's hard to measure tiny changes in

301
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:53,049
oxygen it's easy to measure tiny changes

302
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:57,350
in co2 anytime we do these metabolic

303
00:15:53,049 --> 00:16:00,169
measurements we have bicarbonate effects

304
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,058
and that's a whole other lecture which

305
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:04,990
I'm not going to talk about but co2 goes

306
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:07,250
in and out of solution and it's not

307
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,829
metabolism and we've got it correct for

308
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,688
that and then oxygen is also the sensors

309
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:17,808
much lower cost although we're working

310
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:18,860
with some co2 sensors now that are we

311
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:22,639
think they're going to be done around

312
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:26,000
300 dollars back to do this or cost us

313
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,629
co2 sensors is coming down so this would

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,639
normally be one-to-one but look at this

315
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:35,629
this is this respiratory quotient

316
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:39,680
carbohydrates one proteins point eight

317
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:41,778
fat's point six and lignin point two so

318
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,179
we could begin to start to see what's

319
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:47,350
being degraded what type of material is

320
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:50,120
being degraded if we can develop this

321
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,220
sensor so we we think this would sell a

322
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,529
lot and

323
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,779
it's it's one we're slowly working

324
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:59,419
toward to develop there so there's

325
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,759
people that there's that windy windy

326
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:05,088
silver every year how does that sensor

327
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,740
coming along she's really anxious to buy

328
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:10,188
him as soon as you announce it here's

329
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,160
another huge deal we know that we put

330
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:15,259
ammonium on and even in an ecosystem the

331
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,230
degradation makes ammonium and the

332
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:22,099
bacteria gradually oxidized this to

333
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,529
nitrate this respiratory quotient uses

334
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:27,409
two oxygen it doesn't make any oxygen

335
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:31,269
it's zero so we can begin to tell what

336
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:40,700
forms of nitrogen the bacteria are

337
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:42,289
utilizing in a soil so sometimes we

338
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,390
don't like to say what we're working on

339
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:46,250
people get so excited they want to

340
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,230
happen in next year and it's way down

341
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,630
the road and we have a big problem as

342
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,690
our company and others of wouldn't you

343
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,880
say when a sensor is going to be ready

344
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:58,250
because people get anxious to buy it and

345
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,320
it sometimes it you think it's going to

346
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,700
be ready next month and it still takes

347
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:07,789
six more months it you keep you keep

348
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,400
working on refining the technologies but

349
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:16,940
this is this is one that's in the early

350
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:19,280
idea stages so that's one of my favorite

351
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:24,289
slides but I'm gonna conclude with that

352
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:26,420
I hope this gets you excited about

353
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,839
making more measurements with more kinds

354
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,210
of sensors it's it's a it's a joy to

355
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,740
collect data and and you get you know

356
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,180
how the world is supposed to work and

357
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,750
then you try and measure it and see if

358
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,210
it really works like that and linking

359
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,829
back to those very first quotes I showed

360
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:48,049
if theory and measurement don't agree

361
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:50,569
you've got a red light and eat that but

362
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:52,609
an amazing thing is the theory is wrong

363
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:55,399
sometimes and your measurements are

364
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:59,029
rock-solid and and you can get a Nobel

365
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,429
Prize for turnover turning some things

366
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:03,829
we thought we knew that we really don't

367
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:04,640
know so well and after all that's what

368
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:08,960
re

369
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,670
search is re searching take stuff we

370
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,860
thought we knew and see if we really

371
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,830
know it and a lot of that's a huge

372
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,839
danger of if we think we know something

373
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:19,808
and we're pretty sure we know it and

374
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:24,319
we're wrong that's one of the worst

375
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:26,210
problems of all of science and with

376
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,909
measurements getting better and better

377
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:34,519
and better we can revisit some things

378
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:37,460
that we thought we knew so hope you get

379
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:41,629
an opportunity to use these instruments

380
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:44,900
and and in your research and hear all

381
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:48,000
your endeavors and we look forward to

382
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,960
the potential of working for you

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,960
