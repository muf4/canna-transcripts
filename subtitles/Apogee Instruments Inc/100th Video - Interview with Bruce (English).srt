1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,260
We have a special guest to  celebrate our 100th episode.

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,509
We have Bruce with us here today in the studio.

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,841
Thanks Ben for setting this up.  I'm thrilled to be here.

4
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:19,881
Well we're glad to have you here.

5
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:24,746
Bruce some of your videos have done very very  well and received a lot of attention.

6
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:29,557
In fact, the video with the most views is the  "Cannabis Light Myths and Facts" video.

7
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:34,039
It has, as of this morning, just under 3 million views.

8
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:39,410
We're about 50,000 views away  from from reaching 3 million views.

9
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:43,086
Did you ever think you'd have  a a video with 3 million views?

10
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:51,037
Of course not, when things happen in the world,  that I guess we could say this went viral.

11
00:00:51,037 --> 00:00:57,343
It's little tiny things that just just answered  a lot of questions for people.

12
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:04,525
And in this field, of course,  they're besieged  by advertisements from lighting companies.

13
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:06,552
Here's our magic spectra

14
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:11,427
and you know in science we don't have a  lot of things we call magic

15
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:14,709
Ben - Science and magic really are kind of, you know, counter points for sure.

16
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:20,802
So here's the principles. But, it's not like  "buy this light" it's here's the guiding principles

17
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:23,406
to figure out what kind  of lighting you need.

18
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:25,700
And then you figured out from the principles.

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,292
People ask me that lots of strange things.

20
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:33,420
I mean, I heard that you should always plant at the full moon,

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,516
and I don't tell them that's crazy. I tell them well  we don't have any data to support that.

22
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,951
Oh would we get sometimes into it that doesn't  the lunar pull do something to water

23
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,545
and yes but these are super minor things.

24
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:51,059
There's a lot of diet. Diet is like that.

25
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:55,180
There's thousands of diet books and  people swear by certain diets.

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,326
Same thing with nutrition in plants.

27
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,671
They swear by certain ratios of nutrition.

28
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:04,424
Whereas we go by just principles of nutrition.

29
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,644
And Is this consistent with the principles that we know.

30
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:12,210
So Bruce this is our 100th video

31
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,974
and so along the way is there any moments  that kind of stand out

32
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:20,036
from from filming these videos?

33
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:26,723
Certainly, one of them is that "Myths of Cannabis Lighting" video that that went viral.

34
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:31,560
That was my first experience of something  doing something that became popular.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,430
and then you realize that it's not just the number on the screen.

36
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,567
But if 1% of those people send me emails I get a lot of emails.

37
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:46,536
"Could you just elaborate on this" and on you know. I can't possibly respond to all of them.

38
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:53,527
So I my graduate students reply and that led  to us teaching a course at the University.

39
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:58,480
It's called the and we're teaching we're getting ready  to teach the third edition of this now.

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,889
It's called the "Science and Technology of Medical Cannabis Cultivation"

41
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,129
and that's been a big hit with people that really want to dig deep

42
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,599
and get get into the physiology and genetics of cannabis.

43
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,914
Ben - From a much deeper level

44
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,546
A deeper level.

45
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:21,467
How is it Bruce that you kind of got into to research and and studying

46
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,342
and even starting a company and building sensors?

47
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:26,298
How did that all happen?

48
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,445
People sometimes have asked when you know how I get started in what I do.

49
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:36,622
and I grew up in a very rural area of Minnesota Paynesville Minnesota.

50
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,176
I worked on farms as a kid but my family ran a resort.

51
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,378
A family entrepreneurial thing,

52
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,281
and everybody worked in the resort but it wasn't agriculture.

53
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,409
It wasn't until I got to college.

54
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:56,957
I started College engineering cuz I was good at math in high  school so you do engineering and mechanical and electrical .

55
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:06,387
And at that time I the the students I was there  with were pretty straight arrow Engineers.

56
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:11,757
I mean, I don't know, you know,  The stereotype is a white  shirt and a narrow black tie or something.

57
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:12,808
Ben - Very sharp pencils

58
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:17,838
Yeah pocket full of pencils and maybe a pocket protector  and all that stuff .

59
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:21,575
I took a class in plant biology

60
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:25,141
the subject matter fascinated me

61
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:30,170
but I think I was also drawn by the  kind of students that were in that class.

62
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,304
They were interested in ecology and lots of different things.

63
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:38,853
And I changed my major at some point

64
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:44,514
and started to just do more plant biology,

65
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:54,311
Then I went to graduate school in plant biology horticulture.

66
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,621
and more specifically I moved. I always wanted to go to California.

67
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:03,799
There was just Mystique of there's no absolute truths in California.

68
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:06,727
We reevaluate everything every day. You know.

69
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:10,971
And that to me as a teenager was really interesting.

70
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:14,521
So I got into UC Davis to graduate school,

71
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:19,007
and then I really dug into physiology and things.

72
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,793
But I was always interested in controlled environments

73
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:25,338
and it was for me, it was a synthesis of the engineering.

74
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:29,517
How do you build a box to control the environment to  make plants grow faster?

75
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:33,994
And that's so intriguing with this control systems.

76
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:39,572
And back then, it wasn't a thing to grow food indoors.

77
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,559
It was just a research tool.

78
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:46,216
We build these and we'll understand how to modify the environment.

79
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:49,129
How do plants respond to the environment.

80
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,204
It was all about that.

81
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:58,923
And, Oh gosh, I wrote a paper in a class on this specialized Greenhouse.

82
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:03,038
It was called The Morning Glory Greenhouse.  It had big reflective panels that closed at night

83
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:04,625
and opened in the day.

84
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,257
It was all the energy, and It produced a lot of heat cuz it reflected in

85
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:10,918
and you could heat all these buildings with the heat.

86
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,705
Then at night they closed. That paper which was for a class,

87
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:20,377
got picked up by a journal called "Alternative Sources of Energy"

88
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:22,686
and they said we'd like to publish this paper.

89
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:28,150
and it was before computers and I it had  all these calculations and hand drawn pictures.

90
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:31,252
That got published. That was my first publication.

91
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:39,604
Then that led to me getting an offer for an assistantship  or a research assistantship at Penn State University.

92
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:44,384
So off I go between California and Pennsylvania to get a PhD.

93
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:48,388
It was focused on controlled environment agriculture.

94
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:52,298
That led to me getting a position at Utah State University.

95
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:53,177
Coming here.

96
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:56,396
Now I have more money to do more things.

97
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:59,626
We got a big grant funded by NASA early in my career.

98
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,294
That launched a lot of things.

99
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:04,794
Now "Wow we're doing this stuff for NASA."

100
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:09,306
along the way measuring light was huge.

101
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:18,237
Because of all the environmental parameters we can measure temperature,  humidity, and CO2 better than the plants can sense them.

102
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:22,802
But light, the plant sense that better than our best instruments.

103
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:29,382
So "Wow" there was a really great opportunity to do precision light measurement,

104
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,173
And the sensors were expensive.

105
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:36,567
And I thought well I'm going to fiddle around with this and so...

106
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:41,706
I built, not even in my garage, at my kitchen table

107
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:46,103
built some light meters with photo diodes and modified volt meters.

108
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:48,530
And I just built them for my lab.

109
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,517
Ben - Did you have a background or understanding of electronics?

110
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,640
I did. I had enough of a engineering background yeah

111
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,128
I knew the basics.

112
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,067
I knew Ohm's law that's

113
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,798
Vehicles IR

114
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,767
and you know,  how do I do resistors.

115
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:05,303
So people came to visit the lab and we had these sensors.

116
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:08,870
And they go, "well could I?" they were friends "Could you build  me one?"

117
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,861
"Sure" so I build them one.

118
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:17,398
Then I start to get phone calls from people say I just  saw this sensor, this meter, in somebody's lab.

119
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:21,096
It's terrific. Could you build me one. You don't know me but I'll pay for it.

120
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:26,458
So I went to the University and I said well there's a market here  for these meters.

121
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:34,466
I'd like to build the meters at home and sell them.  I'd like to set up a separate account to keep track of the money.

122
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:39,377
And the university said "No, you can't do that

123
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:42,500
we don't want the liability issues

124
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,607
and we don't want the criticism that we're competing unfairly"

125
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:51,156
but the solution is we'll help you start a company

126
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:55,177
and and we'll give you space in our Research Park.

127
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:57,154
Cool, but guess what that meant,

128
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:59,153
we'll take half the money.

129
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:02,551
I say "Na I'm going to keep making them at my kitchen table."

130
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,831
I don't need you.

131
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:05,127
Ben - It works pretty good at  that point.

132
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:11,225
And there we go. Then it grew and had to build a new garage, much bigger.

133
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:15,028
We were in my garage for eight or ten years.

134
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:17,469
and we weren't trying to grow fast.

135
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:20,540
Then we just got too big.

136
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,896
Then we built this much nicer building.

137
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,504
And it's gone from there.

138
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:29,475
There was no bank loan there was no investors.

139
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:33,851
You know I put a thousands of dollars of my own money into it.

140
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:36,000
We didn't have a bank loan to pay back.

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,783
And because of that the whole company and all the early employees  started just with the passion to build good meters.

142
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:49,688
People really like your cannabis videos. How did you get involved with cannabis?

143
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:58,665
Because we had a reputation for doing precise work in highly controlled environments,

144
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:06,000
cannabis growers came to us and said, in North America and the United States,

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,251
we need help growing a better quality crop.

146
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,866
You've got all the infrastructure to do this.

147
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:16,214
Could we give you funding to do cannabis,

148
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:22,869
and until 2018 the university my lab at the University said

149
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:25,214
"No we can't take their money it's illegal.

150
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:28,537
It's a federally illegal and we'll get in big trouble"

151
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,489
So in December 2017, I think that was the  exact month and year that it the farm Bell passed,

152
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:40,603
It made low THC cannabis legal federally legal.

153
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:45,650
Now it's commonly called hemp, but we just call it low THC cannabis.

154
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,304
You can't get high from it.

155
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:53,844
At that moment, the University said "Okay, now  it's we we'll take their money to work on low THC cannabis."

156
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:59,793
We got a license both from the state of Utah and from the USDA to do this.

157
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,144
and much more security and things like that.

158
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:08,163
Off we go.  With funding from growers because at the time there's no federal funding.

159
00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:14,313
There's no state funding. That's the normal place  people like me get money it's public agencies.

160
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:17,414
These are private companies.

161
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:22,001
I started doing lot of research applying all the things we know to cannabis.

162
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:29,594
And well some of my colleagues said "Oh my, this is a brand new crop.  We're starting from zero."

163
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:33,343
We said, "No, this is the crop like any other."

164
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:37,565
It has the same biochemistry, it has the  same photo periodic requirements,

165
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:40,211
let's look at the things that are unique.

166
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:46,178
That helps us focus the research on things that we didn't know, that were different.

167
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:50,461
And, of course, that led to some pretty rapid progress in publications and pretty soon,

168
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,200
you're getting invited to conferences,

169
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,103
to speak on this. Because you went from nothing to the expert,

170
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:57,920
because the bar was so low.

171
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:01,218
there isn't anybody else working on this at universities.

172
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:05,424
So that was the a big jump start for the Cannabis research.

173
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,043
And we have continued to do the NASA research all along,

174
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:12,129
but the NASA research is purely food crops

175
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,821
and the cannabis research is just cannabis.

176
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:21,665
So through your research did you ever have some  something that popped up you're like "Oh, this is interesting."

177
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:28,192
Yes. I think the public think science progresses when people say "Eureka! I found it!"

178
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:30,630
and that's not true.

179
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:37,966
The phrase that I think is the most common is looking at data  and go "Huh? that's funny."

180
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,587
and "Why did this happen like this?"

181
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:47,038
Then the ability to say this this is not just experimental error there's something here.

182
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:48,351
That's real.

183
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,213
Did you have any of those moments?

184
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:53,380
Oh, they happen all the time all the time.

185
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,725
One of my favorite quotes is from Louis Pasteur

186
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:01,129
he says, "Chance favors the prepared mind."

187
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:10,312
So if you know what you're looking for, you could look at patterns of data and separate experimental error from novel responses.

188
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:16,087
So Bruce right now as a researcher and the owner of of Apogee,

189
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:21,242
what kind of questions do you have at night? What kind of things keep you up?

190
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:30,807
Yeah many and they're often driven by growers.

191
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:35,307
They call with things that can't be explained,

192
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:38,386
and some of them you can explain, many you can.

193
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:44,929
But their responses you can't explain so it isn't always your  own data it's somebody else's data that we're seeing this.

194
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:50,603
And so the those are lead us to do tests on those things.

195
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:57,830
which of course helps those growers enormously. There lots of complex interactions.

196
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,588
Here's a really good example.

197
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:08,968
We knew from reading the literature from 70, 60 to 70 years ago,

198
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:15,527
that there was evidence that cannabis was exceptionally sensitive to light pollution.

199
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:18,449
You know, like some people can sleep  with the lights on, some people can't,

200
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:21,610
they have to have it all dark that's so it's intuitive.

201
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,091
Well, some plants that can have lights on it doesn't  matter and some plants got to have it dark .

202
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:32,521
and so it suggested cannabis was exquisitely sensitive to light pollution.

203
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:38,187
So we start doing some tests and "Wow" we confirm this old research,

204
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:42,749
which haven't been done for a while. It's really sensitive.

205
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:49,646
Well how you going to measure this without an instruments so that led to Apogee building this light pollution detector.

206
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:55,370
Ben - Oh so that's where that came from. Bruce - And everybody measures light in what we call micromoles

207
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,649
It's 10 the the minus 6 moles.  All of a sudden we build a meter to measure nanomoles.

208
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:07,399
10 to the minus 9. A thousand times more sensitive to  measure these and quantify them.

209
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,325
That's been a huge help to growers who need what we call

210
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:15,004
reagent grade darkness at night.

211
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:17,788
You know that's an interesting term that we coined.

212
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:21,622
Poinsettia is a real sensitive crop to light pollution too.

213
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:24,876
To make the bracts turn red. It's a real common crop.

214
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,962
We always said they are our most sensitive crop.

215
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:31,711
But now we've shown cannabis even more sensitive.

216
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:37,860
Well thank you for watching. Thank you Bruce for  taking the time and filming with me for a little bit.

217
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,535

218
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:47,233
and it'll show you more of the things that he's  taught us and you can you can learn a lot from him as well.

219
