00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,959
hello my name is Skyler Smith I do

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,028
technical sales and support here at

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,890
Apogee instruments and we're here to do

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:10,410
another frequently asked questions video

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:13,980
today we're going to talk about the BTM

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,920
3000 update instructions the reason why

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,199
we have the BTM 3000 update is we have

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,449
switched the way we do the format on the

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,750
software and therefore and the firmware

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,779
and so because of that say for example

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,969
it did work on an old computer but then

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,699
you downloaded the latest BTM 3000 and

13
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,320
it's not working on your new computer

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,729
then you would need to do these firmware

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,329
instructions to get it to work

16
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,859
appropriately so here's a few reasons

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,899
why you might be interested in this

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,519
video did your sensor work on a

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,820
different computer and it's not working

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,890
now does your sensors show connected but

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,238
with no serial number and there's a few

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,429
other small things in there you may be

23
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,769
able to pick up if and figure out why

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:59,429
your sensors are not working and we'll

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,320
get it working for you so this is what

26
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,570
the original software looked like the

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,170
original format had your micro mul

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,780
reading right there said biotech marine

29
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,909
this is what it currently looks like if

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,530
this is what your screen shows with your

31
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,939
micro mol per meter squared per second

32
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,368
reading here and you're showing

33
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,750
connected here you're set you're all

34
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,368
done you don't need to worry about any

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,259
sort of firmware or software upgrade

36
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:24,239
you're you're there you're good to go

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,359
you can pause or turn off the video now

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,250
if however you like everyone else

39
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,739
you probably see something more like

40
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,109
this where you're reading 0.0 here and

41
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:37,289
you're showing device not connected here

42
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,478
or you're showing connected here but 0.0

43
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,450
will cover both of those issues by the

44
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,219
end of this video

45
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,290
before we go on though I do need to

46
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,618
stress this point the firmware update

47
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,409
has to happen on a PC and it can't

48
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:56,280
happen on a Mac now once we've updated

49
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,829
the firmware on your sensor on a PC

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,210
you'll you're good to go on a Mac it's

51
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:02,489
going to work great the new software

52
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,889
works great on a Mac but you just can't

53
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,649
upgrade the firmware on it that has to

54
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,840
happen on a PC so friends neighbor

55
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,580
whoever you need to borrow a PC from to

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,319
update it and then you'll be set to go

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,409
on your own Mac

58
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,598
now what I've done here is I've outlined

59
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:20,878
all the instructions this is the

60
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,089
all-inclusive troubleshooting

61
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,620
instructions for you to go through and

62
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,539
I've put these up here and you can see

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,759
I'm scrolling through them fast you can

64
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,620
just pause where if you want to see

65
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,989
something and go back to it we've also

66
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,840
listed these instructions on our website

67
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,280
under the technical support page so this

68
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,348
is just to give you something to refer

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,030
back to if for whatever reason the

70
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:44,369
situations I go through don't match up

71
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,859
with yours perfectly you can come back

72
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,969
to one of these steps and it will answer

73
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:55,650
for you alright so let's go ahead and

74
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:59,068
jump into our demonstration so here we

75
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,519
are blank screen well we need to get the

76
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:05,068
latest version of BTM 3000 we have here

77
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,230
an old sensor that has the old firmware

78
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,848
on it and it would work just fine on the

79
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,699
old software but that's not our example

80
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:14,518
our example is the latest software that

81
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,238
we need to upgrade the firmware on where

82
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,639
do we find it Apogee instruments comm

83
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:24,150
there we are we come across to the

84
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:29,340
support tab then we come down here to

85
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:31,908
where it says software downloads click

86
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,378
there and then we'll come over to

87
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:38,908
biotech marine click right there

88
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:40,560
and we have our manual and then our two

89
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:42,750
versions of course we're doing the

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,930
firmware update so we're on PC version

91
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,378
we'll click there a pretty basic way for

92
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,840
it to download files here down here in

93
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:54,560
the corner of our internet browser it's

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,299
going to take a few seconds for it to

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,509
get I think it's the file size is like

96
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,699
40 megabytes or thereabout

97
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:04,108
so once that gets loaded there then

98
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,599
we'll click on it and go through the

99
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:10,349
install instructions so there we go we

100
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:12,810
have our dot exe file open that up and

101
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:15,298
then our install shields is going to

102
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,579
show up right here in the middle pretty

103
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,718
basic instructions we'll just go through

104
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:25,918
this we hit next yes I accept the terms

105
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:27,629
in the license agreement next yes I want

106
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:33,508
to install up there

107
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:34,620
Program Files x86 BTM 3000 install yes

108
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm okay

109
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:48,600
installing this so we click through

110
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:50,850
these alright now if you had a slightly

111
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,070
older version of the software it may not

112
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,439
have come up with this launch driver

113
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:57,000
installation we do want to make sure

114
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,949
that's checked for all the latest

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,860
version so looks like this we hit finish

116
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:10,470
yes we're okay with that so we will let

117
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,530
it do if we click right here we can see

118
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,820
device driver installation wizard all

119
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,549
right so we click Next

120
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,449
it's installing our drivers for us this

121
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,660
is excellent

122
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:25,379
we hit finish we're done that part is

123
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,900
done now we have the BTM 3000 software

124
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:32,550
so let's open that up and see what we

125
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,569
see pull this up there we go again this

126
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,189
is probably why you're watching the

127
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,550
video cuz you follow those steps and

128
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:41,069
you've landed here what do I do now

129
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,978
alright so first thing is let's just

130
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:47,038
close the software for now and we need

131
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,509
to pull up our device manager so there's

132
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,019
a couple ways to do this through control

133
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,478
panel

134
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:56,129
I like Windows 10 I just click down here

135
00:05:51,478 --> 00:06:00,569
and type in device manager pops right up

136
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:03,689
I open it up here now we can see it says

137
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,939
BTM 3000 USB sensor so it's trying to

138
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,610
recognize it but it has a yellow dot

139
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,639
okay so in our example this is what

140
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,310
we're dealing with so what I'm going to

141
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,340
do is right-click on him and I am going

142
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,810
to uninstall and it's going to say are

143
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,848
you sure you want to delete the driver

144
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,379
software for the soft for this device

145
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:25,649
answer's yes

146
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:30,029
I make sure that's checked I click OK he

147
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:33,629
is gone alright he is out of there so if

148
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:34,859
we open BTM 3000 we can see it says

149
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:38,728
would you like to update your firmware

150
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,540
yes I would so we hit OK and it comes up

151
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:42,159
now if yours did not

152
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,770
come up the first time there have been

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,480
instances where you just have to close

154
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:51,430
out of the software and then disconnect

155
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,439
reconnect your sensor and then open the

156
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,050
software again for some reason some

157
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,579
computers take twice but once you get to

158
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,020
this screen where it after you says

159
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:01,599
would you like to do the firmware update

160
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:04,990
and you click yes then you click on USB

161
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,780
quantum version 2 the correct version is

162
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,879
version 2 this will work for you there

163
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,250
are a few instances who need version 3

164
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,750
but you'll want to contact us if you

165
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,529
think you're one of those cases everyone

166
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,180
else it's version 2 if once you have

167
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:21,339
your sensor reading if it's reading in

168
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,829
the 5,000 area it means you clicked

169
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,839
version 3 you need to just update your

170
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:27,519
firmware to version 2 and we can show

171
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,949
you a couple of those steps later on as

172
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:38,439
well so we click version 2 click open

173
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:41,649
let it do its firmware update all right

174
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:47,250
so it's asking us to reconnect the

175
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:47,250
device if we hit OK and pull it apart

176
00:07:49,949 --> 00:08:03,909
and reconnect it the first thing we will

177
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:05,799
notice alright again

178
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,740
we're not showing any progress here

179
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,960
let's close it and reopen the software

180
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,150
would you like to do the update now I

181
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,479
said you might have to do it twice we're

182
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:18,129
going to have to do it twice do open let

183
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,240
this come up here let it do that

184
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,240
firmware update

185
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,259
now you'll notice that when it was done

186
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,600
correctly

187
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,429
he says USB serial device come three

188
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,930
over here in device manager that's why I

189
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:43,418
like to leave device manager running in

190
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:47,079
the background all right so if we hit

191
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:48,909
okay then it automatically comes up all

192
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,570
right please enter the serial number we

193
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:53,889
know our serial number is 11 66 we can

194
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,970
find that on the white tab right here

195
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:59,970
next to it it says BTM 3011 66 I hit OK

196
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,930
comes up device connected to serial

197
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:10,659
number 11 66 all right so now for those

198
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:13,599
of you who have 0.0 but your device is

199
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,519
connected this step is for you it's also

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,240
on those pages before it said important

201
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,919
last step number 11 so what we do is we

202
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,149
click here on the gear click on

203
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,919
calibration so under multiplier

204
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:33,159
we're in caps lock we're going to type

205
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:35,139
in factory and hit enter and then I'll

206
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:39,490
will allow us to overwrite permanent

207
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:41,319
calibration if we hit 0.0 you know

208
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,149
overwrite you also see it will allow you

209
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,970
to update firmware if for whatever

210
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,949
reason you tried other steps and you

211
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,870
couldn't update the firmware but you can

212
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,690
connect and it will allow you to update

213
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,299
the firmware here this is a way to do it

214
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,420
as well so I overwrite and then I click

215
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:04,379
Save we give it a few seconds to load

216
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:04,379
and then it will begin reading

217
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,620
there we go 5.6 so that's what we're

218
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:21,419
reading with our lights in here is six

219
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:24,840
so those are the steps to update the

220
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:32,129
firmware on your BTM 3000 and to get it

221
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:34,230
to work with the latest software if you

222
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:36,720
