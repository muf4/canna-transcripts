00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,400
hello everyone welcome to the seminar my

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,000
name is Mark blanquis from apog

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,559
instruments in Logan Utah I'm going to

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,960
speak about plant canopy water status

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,239
estimation from canopy temperature

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,199
measurements before getting that far I'm

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,000
going to spend a fair amount of time

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,359
talking about actually measuring surface

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,160
temperature this slide provides a brief

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,720
outline of where the presentation's

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,198
going so first we'll speak I'll talk

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,719
about INF Fred radiometers their

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,280
operation in calibration and then

14
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:35,039
surface temperature measurement

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,120
specifically correcting for surface

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,960
emissivity and field of view also deal

17
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,000
with the challenge of partial canopy

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,200
cover the two methods I'll talk about to

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,920
handle that are angling radiometers and

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
then a model to account for soil

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,879
temperature and then finally we'll get

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,800
to estimating canopy water status we'll

23
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,839
spend some time with the simpler method

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,159
the crop water stress index and then a

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,480
more involved method canopy stod

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,000
conductance

27
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,319
the M the basic components of an

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,438
infrared radiometer are the radiation

29
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,519
detector itself an internal temperature

30
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,679
sensor to provide a temperature

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,759
measurement of the detector and then a

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,360
housing to hold it all

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,200
together the signal generated by the

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,478
radiation detector is proportional to

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,600
the difference between the the radiation

36
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,759
being absorbed by the detector and also

37
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:30,679
the radiation being emitted by the

38
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,040
detector

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,040
all surfaces or objects that have a

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,960
temperature above absolute zero emit

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,320
infrared radiation the detector in the

42
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,199
radiometer is absorbing the radiation

43
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:48,118
that's emitted towards it at the same

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,240
time the detector is emitting radiation

45
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,000
so the signal will be dependent on the

46
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,560
the difference between these two

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,879
radiation streams when the absorbed

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,039
radiation at the detector is less than

49
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,640
the emitted radiation the signal is

50
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,039
negative

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,599
when the absorbed

52
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,080
radiation at the detector is greater

53
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,878
than the emitted radiation the signal is

54
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,000
positive so the sensor is actually

55
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,878
measuring or detecting radiation but

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,959
temperature is the quantity that we're

57
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,079
interested in and of course they're

58
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,800
related through the Stefan boltzman law

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,200
where energy is proportional to a

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,480
constant times the fourth power of

61
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:33,598
temperature another important component

62
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:37,079
an essential component of the radiation

63
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,280
detector itself is a filter to block all

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,719
wavelengths outside of what we call the

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,719
atmospheric window so the plot you're

66
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:47,919
looking at here shows wavelength on the

67
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,239
xaxis and Atmospheric transmittance on

68
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:55,598
the Y AIS the wavelengths between 8 and

69
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:58,000
14 Micron or micrometers is defined as

70
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,560
the atmospheric window because the at

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,800
these wavelengths the transmission of

72
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,799
the atmosphere is very near one meaning

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,280
the atmosphere is transparent like a

74
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,799
window the filter on the radiation

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,039
detector needs to to closely correspond

76
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,799
to the atmospheric window to eliminate

77
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,079
influence from the atmosphere or

78
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,519
essentially see through the atmosphere

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,599
to the surface that we're interested in

80
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,719
measuring

81
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:30,158
below eight Micron we can have

82
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:35,680
interference from water vapor and above

83
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,679
14 Micron we can have interference from

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,840
CO2 the final component That's essential

85
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,639
for infrared radiometer is the

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,479
calibration the photo that you're

87
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:51,158
viewing now is a picture of the

88
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:53,560
calibration system at ape

89
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:55,158
instruments there's two main components

90
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,438
the one that I've circled here is the

91
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,239
actual cap piece where all the

92
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,239
radiometers are held during the

93
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,799
calibration

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,840
procedure the cap piece is mounted on

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,920
top of this piece here which is the

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,719
actual black body cone or radiation

97
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,238
Source what happens during calibration

98
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,839
is the radiometers are mounted in the

99
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,758
cat piece over top of the cone and you

100
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,719
can see some insulation around the cone

101
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,240
there with the two independent pieces

102
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,000
the cap and The Cone piece we can

103
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,439
maintain their their temperatures

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,800
independent of each other and then we

105
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,279
can collect a whole data set across the

106
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,520
whole range of temperatures and during

107
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,279
the the calibration procedure we also

108
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,159
collect the molt signals from the

109
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:46,959
radiometers produces a large data set

110
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,960
that we can then use to derive C custom

111
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,359
coefficients for all

112
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,038
radiometers that allow us to convert the

113
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,038
signal which again from the previous

114
00:04:54,038 --> 00:05:00,000
slide was proportional to the the

115
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:02,360
radiation difference we can convert that

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,680
to a

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,560
temperature once we have a calibrated

118
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,478
radiometer we're ready deploy it in the

119
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,360
field and start making

120
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,159
measurements surface temperature

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,840
measurements are pretty straightforward

122
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,720
when the surface is a black body a black

123
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,000
body is defined as any object or

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,840
material that emits the theoretical

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,399
maximum amount of radiation based on its

126
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,478
temperature or we Define it as a object

127
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,478
or material with an emissivity equal to

128
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,279
one where emissivity is just the FL

129
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:36,959
fraction of black body

130
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,719
emission so here I have a plant canopy

131
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,519
with emissivity equal to

132
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,600
one in that scenario the target

133
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,639
temperature returned by the radiometer

134
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,039
would equal the true surface

135
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,439
temperature but in practice natural

136
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:55,639
surfaces are not black bodies most plant

137
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,719
canopies have emissivity is equal to 98

138
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,478
or

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,199
99 what that means is the plant canopy

140
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:07,639
will will be emitting 98 or 99% of the

141
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,800
theoretical maximum based on

142
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:15,560
temperature and there'll be a small

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,560
fraction of background radiation that's

144
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,598
directed towards the the radiometer

145
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,120
because it's reflected from the surface

146
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:26,038
so surface reflectance is equal to 1

147
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,360
minus the

148
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,079
emissivity or in our case it would be

149
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,759
1us 0

150
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,800
98 so essentially what this means is if

151
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,520
we deploy a radiometer to measure a

152
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,439
plant canopy in an outdoor environment

153
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,680
the background is the sky the sky is

154
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,959
emitting infrared radiation just like

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,160
the plant canopy and where the plant

156
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,239
canopy is not a perfect black body with

157
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,599
an emissivity equal to one a smaller

158
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,000
fraction one minus the emissivity of the

159
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,839
background radiation in this case coming

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,038
from the sky is reflected from the plant

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,918
canopy and directed towards the

162
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,120
radiometer typically the sky temperature

163
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,918
and the surface temperature are much

164
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,079
different and so we have to account for

165
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,639
this reflected fraction in order to get

166
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,120
accurate measurement of the surface

167
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,519
temperature in order to do so we need

168
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,319
the an estimate or measurement of the

169
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,719
surface emissivity an estimate or

170
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,560
measurement of the radiation coming from

171
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,400
the sky in addition to our measurement

172
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,598
of the the surface temperature

173
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,478
so I'm not going to go through the

174
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,598
derivation of the equation to correct

175
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:39,079
for emissivity but I'm showing it here

176
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,360
so we take our our measurement of Target

177
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,959
temperature and we input it along with

178
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,560
our measurement or estimate emissivity

179
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,878
and our measurement or estimate of the

180
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,000
background temperature then we can

181
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,560
calculate the the actual or true surface

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,879
temperature to give you an idea of the

183
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,439
the magnitude of effect of

184
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,000
emissivity have a couple simple examples

185
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,360
one for a clear day and one for a cloudy

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,439
day so let's assume that our sensor is

187
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,280
measuring a temperature of 25

188
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,879
cels a pretty standard temp background

189
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:16,198
temperature or Sky temperature for a

190
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,919
clear day would be -4

191
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:23,360
Celsius again our canopy emissivity is

192
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:26,959
098 and our when we plug all those

193
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,158
numbers into the equation above we get a

194
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,239
surface temperature almost a full de

195
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,918
warm warmer than the temperature we

196
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,440
measure with the

197
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:39,120
radiometer on a cloudy day the

198
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,760
background temperature is much warmer

199
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,039
it's a lot closer to the actual measured

200
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,159
surface temperature and when we plug the

201
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,559
numbers into the our equation above for

202
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:53,879
a cloudy day we find that the surface

203
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,359
temperature is much closer to the the

204
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,360
measured

205
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:03,479
temperature here we have a table listing

206
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,879
emissivities for several different

207
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,720
surfaces one would encounter in natural

208
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:13,120
settings plants soils water and so forth

209
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,399
you can see that most natural surfaces

210
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,240
are near black bodies with emissivities

211
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:23,078
in the 0.9 range we can find some things

212
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,120
that are very very low emissivity like

213
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:28,479
polished aluminum for example I also

214
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,360
have at the bottom of the slide some

215
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,759
typical values for the background

216
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,399
temperature or be Sky temperatures in an

217
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,838
environmental application clear sky is

218
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:42,839
often very cold -40 to -60 C overcast

219
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,360
sky is often near air temperature I've

220
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,160
also listed a a simple equation that you

221
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,120
can use to

222
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:53,039
calculate Sky temperature it's

223
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,159
approximated from the air temperature

224
00:09:53,039 --> 00:10:00,519
where we take air temperature plus 50 *

225
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,679
the fraction of clouds - 6

226
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,440
so on a clear day our fraction of clouds

227
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:09,838
would be zero and this equation would

228
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,480
simplify to air temperature minus 60 is

229
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,959
equal to the sky temperature on a

230
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,920
completely overcast day our FL fraction

231
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,278
of clouds would be one this equation

232
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,838
would simplify to air temperature minus

233
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:27,120
10 would be equal to Sky temperature on

234
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:30,640
an overcast a so this can be used

235
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,839
for simple way to approximate Sky

236
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,600
temperature used with emissivity

237
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,920
correction moving on from emissivity

238
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,440
another important consideration is the

239
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,000
area of surface that the radiometer

240
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,040
actually views or in other words the

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,320
field of view so I like to draw an

242
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,360
analogy whenever I explain field of view

243
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,000
of an infrared radiometer and the best

244
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,320
analogy that I can think of is put

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,240
yourself in front of a a flat wall in a

246
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,399
dark room with a flashlight if you hold

247
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,039
the flashlight perpendicular to the wall

248
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,919
and turn on the flashlight you'll see a

249
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,199
a circle of light as you move the

250
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,439
flashlight closer to the wall the circle

251
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,839
gets smaller and as you move the

252
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,880
flashlight away from the wall the circle

253
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,480
gets larger if you start to angle that

254
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,320
flashlight so it's no longer

255
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,959
perpendicular to the wall then the

256
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,720
circle of light spreads out into an

257
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:31,439
ellipse so the the same principle holds

258
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,399
for a radiometer that you direct towards

259
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,720
a a surface if the radiometer is

260
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,039
oriented perpendicular to the surface

261
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,360
then it's going to to view or sense a

262
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,399
circle if the radiometer is close to the

263
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,480
surface it will be a small circle and if

264
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,480
the radiometer is moved further from the

265
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,159
surface it will be a larger Circle if

266
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,039
you start angling it away from

267
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,759
perpendicular it will view an ellipse

268
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,679
and the area that

269
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,439
being measured or sensed by the

270
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,559
radiometer is dependent on three things

271
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,320
the field of view the radiometer

272
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,199
mounting height and the radiometer

273
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,879
mounting angle where the field of view

274
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,240
is just defined as the angle or half

275
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:21,240
angle of the cone that's formed by the

276
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:26,839
footprint that the radiometer sees and

277
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:29,839
then the apex of the cone here at the

278
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,000
aperture so companies should specify

279
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,800
what the field of view of the radiometer

280
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,039
is in this example it's a 22° half angle

281
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:42,198
or a 44° full angle field of

282
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,039
view this slide shows multiple different

283
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,639
models that are available from apog

284
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,240
instruments and it lists their their

285
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,399
fields of view I won't go into detail

286
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,879
about calculating the the field of view

287
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,440
but one very helpful tool that runs the

288
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,039
calculations

289
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,399
is found online the website

290
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,919
here all you have to plug in in this

291
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,360
calculator are the three things I

292
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,719
mentioned on the previous Slide the

293
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,240
field of view specification in terms of

294
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,759
the half angle the distance of the

295
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,240
radiometer from the Target and then the

296
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,919
angle of the radiometer with respect to

297
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,799
the Target and the calculator Returns

298
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,719
the dimensions of the ground area that

299
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,319
the radiometer will be radiometer will

300
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,199
be viewing or sensing and also the the

301
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,600
area of the

302
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:37,719
footprint one of the challenges of

303
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,519
measuring plant canopy temperature with

304
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,720
an infrared

305
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,120
radiometer is the situation where plant

306
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,360
canopy doesn't occupy the entire field

307
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,759
of view shown here in this example plant

308
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,399
canopy occupies part of the field of

309
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,560
view but the radiometers also seeing

310
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,519
some

311
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,559
soil in most situations the soil

312
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,399
temperature plant canopy temperature

313
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:06,439
different so in order to get an estimate

314
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,000
of the canopy temperature we have to

315
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,160
account for the soil temperature somehow

316
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,799
or eliminate the soil from the field of

317
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,838
view one way to deal with this is the

318
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,758
angle the radiometer such that we

319
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,000
maximize canopy within the field of

320
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:27,240
view doing

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,440
this it's very helpful to rely on

322
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,959
the field of you calculator that I

323
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:37,079
mentioned in the previous slide it can

324
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:40,119
provide estimates of the actual area

325
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,120
being sensed by the

326
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:46,120
radiometer so another way to try to

327
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,839
estimate plant canopy temperature

328
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,078
when the surface is only partially

329
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,399
covered by the canopy is to actually

330
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:55,799
measure or estimate the soil it's

331
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,240
temperature and then approximate the

332
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,479
fraction of canopy within the field of

333
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
view of the radius R ometer and the

334
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,440
fraction of soil within the field of

335
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,600
view of the

336
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,560
radiometer here again I won't go through

337
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,440
the derivation of this equation but we

338
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,919
can use this simple relationship with

339
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,480
the measurement of the soil

340
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:21,958
temperature estimate of the fraction of

341
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,720
surface that's soil a fraction of

342
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,719
surface that's canopy and then the

343
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,040
actual surface temperature that we

344
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,240
measure with the radiometer and

345
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,240
calculate the canopy

346
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,399
temperature once we have a measurement

347
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
of actual canopy temperature we're ready

348
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,078
to progress to use that canopy

349
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,839
temperature to estimate canopy water

350
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,198
status but before we go through the two

351
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,560
methods that I mentioned in the

352
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:51,278
introduction I wanted to talk a little

353
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,359
bit about the theory behind using canopy

354
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,799
temperature as an indicator of water

355
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,240
status so plant leaves are actually

356
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,159
covered with small microscopic pores

357
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,879
called

358
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,360
stomata in order to photosynthesize

359
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,958
plants have to take up

360
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,919
CO2 stomata open in the presence of

361
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:15,278
light in order to allow CO2 to enter for

362
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:18,719
photosynthesis an inevitable trade off

363
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:21,078
when stomata open is water loss plant

364
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,720
leaves are saturated with water and the

365
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:26,719
atmosphere is often dry sometimes very

366
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,120
dry so water evaporates out of the

367
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,278
stomata

368
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,560
when they're open in order for CO2

369
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:37,919
uptake to

370
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:40,000
occur so plants uptake soil water to

371
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,078
replace the water being lost through the

372
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,480
stata during photosynthetic uptake of

373
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:49,638
CO2 and as plants draw down water in the

374
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,360
soil and soil water becomes limiting

375
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,079
plant water uptake obviously starts to

376
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,839
decline this tends to close

377
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:02,599
stoat stomato closure reduces the stodal

378
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,038
aperture or the degree of opening and

379
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,279
this in turn reduces the transpiration

380
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:11,359
or the evaporation of water from the

381
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:15,558
stomata evaporation is a cooling process

382
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:19,719
so as stomata cloes in response to a

383
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:22,038
draw down of soil water plants aren't as

384
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,078
cool as they otherwise would be so the

385
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:28,480
canopy temperature thereby

386
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,440
increases one of the most important

387
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,679
factors

388
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,320
we have to

389
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:39,440
remember however is that soil water

390
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:42,759
status is not the only control on canopy

391
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,640
temperature canopy temperature by itself

392
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:48,038
is actually a poor indicator of plant

393
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,360
water status because there's multiple

394
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:53,798
factors that control canopy temperature

395
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,319
in addition to transpirational cooling

396
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,200
which is partially controlled by the

397
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,678
soil water status air temperature

398
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,759
humidity radiation and wind all the

399
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:08,000
environmental conditions that the plant

400
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:10,720
is subject to will influence the canopy

401
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,640
temperature so in order to use canopy

402
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,480
temperature as a means of estimating

403
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,679
water status we have to account for all

404
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,200
of the variables that can influence

405
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,200
influence

406
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,519
it so an early method and a rather

407
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,759
simple method for using canopy

408
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,519
temperature to quantify water status is

409
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,879
called the crop water water stress index

410
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,359
abbreviated

411
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,720
cwsi this method was developed by idso

412
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,399
and colleagues in

413
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,600
1981 at the end of the presentation I'll

414
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,080
provide the full Citation for the for

415
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:48,038
the paper that Ido and colleagues

416
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:50,079
published but essentially they found

417
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,480
through their field data that the

418
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:56,678
difference between canopy and air

419
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:01,079
temperature for a well-watered canopy

420
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:03,919
declined as vapor pressure deficit

421
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,678
increased they also found that this

422
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,320
canopy to air temperature difference was

423
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:12,840
relatively constant for a canopy

424
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,759
experiencing significant water

425
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:18,158
stress so they use these two

426
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,240
boundaries what we're defining as a

427
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,720
nonwater stress Baseline and a water

428
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,839
stress Baseline sort of reference points

429
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,960
to compare actual measurements of canop

430
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,359
p and air

431
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,880
temperature so here's the equation that

432
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:39,319
they developed the crop water stress

433
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,240
index is the measurement of canopy minus

434
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,798
air

435
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,640
temperature minus the non-water stress

436
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:49,918
Baseline then divided by the difference

437
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,080
between the water stressed and non-water

438
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,720
stressed

439
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:57,199
Baseline so the required measurements in

440
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,200
order to apply this empirically based

441
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,720
crop water stress index

442
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,558
are canopy temperature air temperature

443
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,640
and relative

444
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:07,918
humidity the air temperature and

445
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,679
humidity are required to calculate the

446
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,799
vapor pressure deficit so just to

447
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,840
illustrate how the crop water stress

448
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,440
index

449
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:21,279
Works let's say our measured canopy

450
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,759
minus air temperature value was Zero for

451
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:27,279
a vapor pressure deficit of three we

452
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,240
would then calculate the crop water

453
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,440
stress index by taking the difference

454
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,120
between this measured

455
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,320
value and the non-water stress Baseline

456
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,158
which we Define as a and then dividing

457
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,158
that by the difference

458
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,360
between the water stress

459
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,600
Baseline and the non-water stress

460
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:54,639
Baseline which we Define as b a crop

461
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:58,759
water stress index is Just A over B or

462
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:02,080
in our example we take our measured

463
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:05,879
value of canopy minus air temperature of

464
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,319
zero subtract off the nonwater stress

465
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,360
Baseline then divide the numerator by

466
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:14,798
the difference between the water stress

467
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,759
Baseline and non-water stress Baseline

468
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,319
and that gives us a crop water stress

469
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,879
index of 046 or

470
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,599
approximately halfway between the

471
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,400
non-water stress and water stress

472
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,199
Baseline the crop water stress index is

473
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,120
actually designed

474
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,319
to Output a value of zero when the

475
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:36,319
measured value of canopy to air

476
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:41,439
temperature falls on top of the

477
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,960
non-water stress Baseline and it outputs

478
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,759
a value of one when the measured value

479
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,798
of canopy to air temperature falls on

480
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,720
top of the water stress

481
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,158
Baseline the major advantages of using

482
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,159
the empirical crop water stress index

483
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,760
are at Simplicity it only requires three

484
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,840
measurements

485
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,640
and the measurement errors are

486
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:07,678
calibrated out typically the baselines

487
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,960
are derived from field measurements

488
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,200
which allows for field

489
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,360
calibration the disadvantages are that

490
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,759
empirical data is required to determine

491
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,519
the non-water stress and water stress

492
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:23,400
baselines so we have to have some field

493
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,319
collection Data before we

494
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,120
start the alternative to this would be

495
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,678
finding specific crop specific

496
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,439
specific values of the non-water stress

497
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,960
and water stress Baseline in the

498
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,880
literature another major disadvantage is

499
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,720
the environmental conditions must be

500
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,840
similar from one hour to the next if

501
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,798
we're going to compare hourly values of

502
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,480
crop water stress index or from one day

503
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,759
to the next if we're going to compare

504
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,880
daily values of the crop water stress

505
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,319
index the reason

506
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,559
being we said in the previous slide that

507
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:01,599
multiple factors beyond the amount of

508
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:04,278
soil water available for plants to

509
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:07,839
uptake control canopy

510
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:10,839
temperature wind speed radiation air

511
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:14,839
temperature all of these variables will

512
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:17,599
impact the canopy to air temperature

513
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,639
difference so if we have significantly

514
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,639
different wind speed from one day to the

515
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,880
next or a significantly different

516
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,480
radiation environment from one day to

517
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,159
the next this won't be accounted for in

518
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,640
our baselines

519
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,960
makes the empirical crop water stress

520
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,559
index error

521
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,558
prone but to show how well the crop

522
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:44,480
water stress index works I have here 11

523
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:46,200
days of data collected over a corn field

524
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,759
near North Plat

525
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,480
Nebraska in the middle of

526
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:53,919
July the upper graph we're showing the

527
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,440
canopy to air temperature difference and

528
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,960
in the lower graph we're showing the

529
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,960
crop water stress index the green line

530
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,640
is the nonwater stress Baseline the red

531
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,640
line is the water stress Baseline and

532
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,159
the black line is the measured value of

533
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,759
canopy to air

534
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,120
temperature you can see in the first

535
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:18,079
couple days the crop water stress index

536
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:21,519
is quite

537
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:24,678
low but it tends to increase over the

538
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,839
course of a few days before dropping

539
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:31,759
back down again here the response going

540
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:35,639
from a value near 0 five or 6 back down

541
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:38,440
to a value near zero was caused by 20

542
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,440
millimeters of rainfall so the quap

543
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,600
water stress index behaves how we would

544
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,919
expect it increases as soil water is

545
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:50,879
drawn down when rain

546
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,320
falls it responds by decreasing to near

547
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,640
zero you can see near the end of this

548
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:59,079
data set it's starting to increase again

549
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,120
indicating water stress due to soil

550
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:05,119
water draw down one more interesting

551
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,038
point to make is that there is within

552
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,079
day

553
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:12,640
variability this may represent actual

554
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,960
increase in the crop water stress

555
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,278
index over the course of a day or it

556
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,079
might indicate variable environmental

557
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:25,398
conditions in addition to the

558
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:29,519
empirical crop water stress

559
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:32,719
index Jackson and colleagues in 1981

560
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:35,158
also developed a theoretical or energy

561
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,399
balance-based version of the crop water

562
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,480
stress index so rather than relying on

563
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:44,398
the empirically derived baselines they

564
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,399
took all of the equations describing the

565
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:49,199
energy balance for the plant canopy

566
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:51,599
shown here in the

567
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,200
diagram and they combined them and

568
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,639
rearranged them to solve for the canopy

569
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,840
to air temperature

570
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,720
difference I won't combine the equations

571
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:07,558
and show the the TC minus ta equation

572
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,558
but what that gives you is a a means of

573
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:14,558
calculating the nonwater stressed and

574
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:17,158
water stressed Baseline in real time so

575
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:20,240
that conditions don't have to be the

576
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,278
same from hour to hour or day to day as

577
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,240
required with the empirical crop water

578
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,720
stress

579
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,720
index the drawback to this more

580
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,600
theoretical or energy balance based

581
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,278
version is it requires a lot more data

582
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,918
in order to actually get values of the

583
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,919
crop water stress index so in addition

584
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,240
to canopy temperature air temperature

585
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,759
and relative humidity we also have to

586
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,720
have a measurement or estimate of net

587
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,480
radiation a measurement of wind speed

588
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,798
and then measurements or estimates of

589
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,558
canopy height and leaf area

590
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:54,879
index I won't say anything more in this

591
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,599
presentation about the theoretical

592
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,039
version of the crop water stress index

593
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,398
but again at the the end of the

594
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,440
presentation I'll provide the reference

595
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:07,239
to the paper in which it was derived a

596
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,798
method similar to the energy balance

597
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,120
based version of the crop water stress

598
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:15,398
index is a direct calculation of the

599
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:18,519
plant canopy St mod

600
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:21,599
conductance so we can take the exact

601
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,519
same plant canopy energy balance

602
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:27,839
equations that we were used to derive

603
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:30,918
the theoretical crop water stress index

604
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:34,599
and we can combine them and rearrange

605
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,520
them to solve for this term the plant

606
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:39,839
canopy stodel

607
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:43,000
conductance stomatal conductance is

608
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,599
actual quantification of the degree of

609
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,119
stomatal opening or stoal

610
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,558
closure so this calculation of plant

611
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:55,879
canopy stomal

612
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,240
conductance has the advantage of being a

613
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,399
physiological variable that's directly

614
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,960
related to stodal aperture and it

615
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:07,518
actually accounts for all variables

616
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,640
influencing canopy temperature so unlike

617
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,798
the empirical crop water stress index it

618
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,080
should work well under all environmental

619
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,480
conditions so to demonstrate the

620
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:22,278
calculation of canopy stodel conductance

621
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,480
have the same data set for corn near

622
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:28,558
North Plat Nebraska in the graph on the

623
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,839
top the black line is the actual canopy

624
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,319
stodel conductance calculated from the

625
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,278
equation on the previous slide and the

626
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:38,158
green line is a value we're calling

627
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:41,079
potential canopy Stato

628
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,679
conductance it's derived from a leaf

629
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:47,158
level model scaled up to the canopy the

630
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,440
details are found in the blonquist at

631
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,799
all paper referenced on the previous

632
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,798
slide I won't go into

633
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,679
the nuts and bolts of the leaf level

634
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,720
model but I will provide the reference

635
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,120
for the

636
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:06,319
paper near the at the end of this

637
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,798
slideshow so comparison of the actual to

638
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:12,158
potential canopy stomato conductance

639
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:15,359
gives an index of water status you can

640
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,679
see here the ratio starts out near one

641
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,839
and then

642
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,278
declines as the canopy draw draws down

643
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,759
water from the

644
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,679
soil just like we saw with the crop

645
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:29,278
water stress index it dropped to near

646
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:31,720
zero following a rainfall event the

647
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,839
ratio of actual to potential canopy

648
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,919
conductance increases after the rainfall

649
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:41,158
event and then after a couple days being

650
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,600
near one it starts to decline again as

651
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,360
water stress sets back

652
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:50,359
in also like the cross water stress

653
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:54,519
index there is some within day VAR

654
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:58,719
variability of the ratio of actual to

655
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,720
potential canopy conductance

656
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,519
this slide just provides an indication

657
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,759
of how well the calculation of actual

658
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:10,440
canopy conductance works here we're

659
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:13,640
showing the values from the equation

660
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,720
compared to potential values derived

661
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,880
from a scaled up Leaf level model for

662
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,839
all days immediately following rainfall

663
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,840
for the entire

664
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:28,000
Summer from corn crop near North Plat

665
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,879
Nebraska so the reason we're only

666
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,679
showing data for days immediately

667
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,679
following rainfalls we would expect the

668
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,038
actual conductance to closely match the

669
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,519
potential conductance under wellwater

670
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,278
conditions and indeed that's what they

671
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,359
we find the data match a one to one line

672
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:49,159
relatively well there are some outliers

673
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,319
where the actual conductance is

674
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,760
significantly higher than the potential

675
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:56,879
conductance and it's possible These are

676
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,720
times when the canopy is wet

677
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,799
unfortunately we didn't have a wetness

678
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,200
sensor to determine when the canopy was

679
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:07,918
wet and when the canopy was

680
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,880
dry so just to provide some some summary

681
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,639
in

682
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,679
conclusion canopy temperatures can be

683
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:16,240
used as a means to determine plant

684
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,720
canopy water status there's multiple

685
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,720
ways to do so I've demonstrated a simple

686
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,960
and a more complex method for using

687
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,079
canopy temperatures to estimate water

688
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,679
status we found that both methods were

689
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:34,199
sensitive to water stress and

690
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,759
rainfall and maybe the most

691
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,558
important conclusion that I can make is

692
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,798
that in order for the methods to work

693
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:44,440
canopy temperature measurements must be

694
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:47,440
accurate so the correction for surface

695
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,639
emissivity is significant and should be

696
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,558
done and field of view must be

697
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:54,240
considered especially for conditions of

698
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:57,200
partial canopy cover want to make sure

699
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,679
that canopy is being measured rather

700
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,679
than some

701
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,080
mixture of canopy and soil here are the

702
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,919
references for the papers that I

703
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,879
mentioned during the talk much more

704
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,559
detail can be found regarding the three

705
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,600
different methods in each paper I hope

706
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,519
this presentation was helpful for

707
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,759
everyone I really appreciate the

708
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,720
opportunity to be part of decagon

709
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,119
seminar series and thank the audience

710
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,120
for their participation
