1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,830
start this is day two of approximately

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:14,490
an eighth series lectures of the energy

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,219
balance principles and I want to review

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,109
today a little bit of where we got

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,028
yesterday just very quickly and that's

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,050
why I did not erase the board because we

7
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:26,698
can put it up here but the key take-home

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,000
message from yesterday is we're

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,730
measuring radiation and then through

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,238
this latent heat of evaporation we can

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:41,269
calculate how much water would have to

12
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:44,578
evaporate to balance this and we go to a

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,309
volume of water and then multiplied by

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,370
area depth of water which the depth of

15
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:52,519
water is typically the irrigation that

16
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,229
we tell people to put on how many

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,989
millimeters a day or how many inches a

18
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:03,839
day should you be putting on to balance

19
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:08,298
this equation so the key point we got to

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,670
is if we measure 30 mega joules a day

21
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:13,740
which yesterday we got 30 mega joules

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,090
today we're going to get 30 mega joules

23
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:21,209
it's a clear day it's summer if all of

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,380
that was absorbed we would have to

25
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:29,368
evaporate 12 liters of water per meter

26
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:32,688
squared every day 12 liters of water and

27
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:37,349
I always think about a meter squared

28
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:39,569
this tabletop is probably not it's close

29
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:45,030
to a meter squared but that is a lot of

30
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:49,169
water and it's worth remembering because

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,219
of these volume and depth things twelves

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:58,530
liters of water is one point two

33
00:01:52,219 --> 00:02:04,920
centimeters of water per day than the

34
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:07,500
meters squared the depth cancels so it's

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,590
possible to get conditions where you

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,750
have to evaporate 1.2 centimeters of

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,060
water a day to balance this but this is

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,639
an extraordinary amount of water we as

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,280
we pointed out the other day we get more

40
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:24,359
like half of this so now we have a case

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,780
where something's wrong the typical

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,959
measured evaporation is only half of

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,269
what we calculated so either that model

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,360
is wrong or the measurements are wrong

45
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,769
and like all science when we start out

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,750
with this we don't know which one's

47
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,280
wrong so we go back and look at the

48
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,370
measurements we'll go back and look at

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:51,180
the model and in this case the model is

50
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:54,569
not sufficiently detailed to calculate

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:58,080
absorb radiation I did it purposely did

52
00:02:54,568 --> 00:03:02,119
a very simple model yesterday and assume

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,040
if 30 comes in every speck of that is

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,890
absorbed and evaporates water and that

55
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:12,810
never happens not we never get a hundred

56
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:17,309
percent absorption so I want to start by

57
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:22,890
dividing this up now before I talk about

58
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:27,959
that yesterday we talked about Einsteins

59
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:32,039
P and how much energy you get from this

60
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,549
thing I don't think I made copies of

61
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,919
this but I will and you can have them

62
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:43,099
here's the math of this the key for this

63
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,098
thing and zoom out just a little bit

64
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:52,920
and the answer depending on exactly how

65
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:56,530
big you assumed that p is is 6,000 years

66
00:03:52,919 --> 00:04:00,780
so in perfect SI units it's more like

67
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,829
six killer years using the right prefix

68
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,658
it's a good chance you're going to die

69
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,569
from something else before you run out

70
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:10,899
of energy and that p and it's it's a

71
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:13,688
pretty simple calculation and here's the

72
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,870
dimensional analysis of it showing

73
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:22,000
energy kilograms per meter second

74
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:25,149
squared times a meter is a jewel and a

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,709
Joule is a Newton per meter so when you

76
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:31,299
work through this you get a good sense

77
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:35,529
of these the units for energy and I'll

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:39,430
give you a copy of this this is a good

79
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:43,929
time to point out one of the reasons for

80
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:48,939
using SI units when students do this

81
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:52,110
calculation in class they frequently get

82
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:54,490
it wrong by a factor of a thousand

83
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,259
where's that where's the air where's the

84
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,280
air it's wrong by a factor of a thousand

85
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:05,379
it's hard to tell because you might you

86
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:08,649
might at such a long time anyway the

87
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:11,379
place that people make the error and now

88
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:17,259
I need to create a little bit of room

89
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:18,939
here it's I'm going to blame this on the

90
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,490
nutrition and food science people

91
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:24,279
because they got it they've got it all

92
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:28,379
screwed up what are they used for energy

93
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,379
how many calories should you eat per day

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:42,360
that's you should eat so many calories

95
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:45,120
per day they capitalize the word

96
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,720
calories and they say when it's

97
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,220
capitalized it means a thousand calories

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,319
that's nobody else does that you don't

99
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,280
capitalize words and multiply by a

100
00:05:52,319 --> 00:06:02,150
thousand except they do and so a calorie

101
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:07,978
spelled with the capital C is equal to a

102
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:11,638
thousand calories spelled with a

103
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:18,288
lowercase C and that trips people up all

104
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:23,668
the time in this so we need 2400

105
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:26,699
kilocalories a day then if we should we

106
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:28,948
should get rid of this capitalized C but

107
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,960
this is a big problem it's on cereal

108
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,520
boxes and it's everywhere and you just

109
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,189
got to know that when you capitalize

110
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:40,049
that word it's thousand times worth a

111
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:43,740
thousand times more interestingly enough

112
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:48,199
when you do this math our energy

113
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:51,199
requirements 4.18 kilojoules per

114
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,199
kilowatt

115
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,579
we need about 10 mega joules a day for

116
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:58,500
energy for a typical person I just

117
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,800
that's an easy number to remember 10

118
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,779
mega joules and now you could start to

119
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,908
think about everything in mega joules

120
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,908
and stuff start stuff line up

121
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,560
so I'll give you a copy of this it's

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,949
system it's just a helpful introduction

123
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,910
to units and I also want to say one

124
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:30,228
other introductory thing I didn't

125
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:34,419
mention this yesterday but at the

126
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:37,009
University we have a requirement for

127
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:41,269
competency in writing for graduate

128
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:43,370
students and American students don't

129
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:45,198
have a problem with near-native fluency

130
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,590
but foreign students we ask them to

131
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,100
write an essay about something to show

132
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:53,810
that they have good command of English

133
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,660
they take this TOEFL test and other

134
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,740
things but this was an essay which I'm

135
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,199
gonna hand out you could take a copy of

136
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,038
it's a short essay it was written by a

137
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,910
woman from China and I was on her

138
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:13,610
committee I thought this is one of the

139
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:17,030
best written essays that I'd ever seen

140
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,680
by a by a foreign student and it's about

141
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,138
as you can see differences in the

142
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,990
educational system between the United

143
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,269
States and China and she talks about her

144
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,759
experiences in China where memorization

145
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:29,779
is prized if you can recite things and

146
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,830
memorize them

147
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:37,579
you're just promoted you're a genius

148
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:41,930
minimal effort to apply the knowledge in

149
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,908
creative ways and she said I was amazed

150
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,789
here if people gave me a page of notes

151
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:48,350
for exams I didn't have to memorize I

152
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:53,838
just had to learn how to apply the

153
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,550
information so that we aspire to help

154
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,920
people understand how to apply the

155
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:59,870
information rather than memorizing it

156
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:05,599
because you can look stuff up in a book

157
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:10,700
and memorization is not a goal of our of

158
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:13,610
our education except in some cases where

159
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,759
I guess in the third and fourth grade

160
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,050
don't memorize edition tables and I

161
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,539
don't know if you memorize those or

162
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:23,149
figure them out but kids kids have to

163
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:26,179
pass multiplication tables and

164
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:29,750
but beyond that we're always looking at

165
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:33,588
how to apply stuff so this is a it's a

166
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,769
nice essay it's shortened and I was I

167
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,480
was really touched by it and it's it's

168
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,549
part of the reason the world comes to

169
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,920
the United States to study because of

170
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:45,409
our approach to education trying to

171
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:50,379
apply the principles rather than just

172
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:50,379
memorizing the principles so

173
00:09:54,289 --> 00:10:00,539
now let's get back to this radiation and

174
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:03,929
now I can start to erase the stuff from

175
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:06,568
yesterday we're gonna keep

176
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:09,208
so speaking of memorization this is a

177
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:10,860
good number you can have it on a card in

178
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:14,039
your pocket or something but this is a

179
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:18,209
good number to remember because you it's

180
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,698
quickly energy and volume of water and

181
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:26,068
go back and forth between those units

182
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:29,179
and it's worth mentioning let's see I'm

183
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:29,179
gonna keep going here

184
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:42,528
we don't always use leaders but of

185
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:45,028
course 2.45 kilojoules per milliliter

186
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:47,639
dividing numerator and denominator by a

187
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:50,100
thousand so once you get it one memorize

188
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,009
you can quickly switch and of course a

189
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:58,139
millimeter is a is a gram of water it's

190
00:10:53,009 --> 00:11:00,240
a cubic centimeter of water so that's

191
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,970
just switching units quickly back and

192
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,948
forth and I've been my experience I've

193
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,139
found it useful I'm using this number so

194
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:10,469
much I can flip the units in my head

195
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:12,360
pretty fast to fit the question that's

196
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:17,550
being asked what volume water is

197
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:20,370
evaporated alright we get calories

198
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:25,039
figured out we're gonna leave our leaf

199
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:32,429
right there everyone's committed this to

200
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:37,679
memory now we get we got our units

201
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:42,808
conversion before I get into separating

202
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:45,778
this I thought of working this out be in

203
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:51,688
as a quantitative example of what how do

204
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:53,490
we calculate this 5% and I drew this and

205
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:56,808
I got an example for him and give you a

206
00:11:53,490 --> 00:12:00,089
handout on this because everything is

207
00:11:56,808 --> 00:12:07,219
quantitative and calculated here's the

208
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:07,220
energy in here's photosynthesis

209
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:14,600
abbreviated 0 0 and

210
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:26,519
my example goes up to full sunlight

211
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:29,220
thousand watts per meter squared and we

212
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,139
do our curve on here look something like

213
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,369
this

214
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:37,979
now we clamp on a leaf with a

215
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:39,839
photosynthesis system it's a I call them

216
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:42,119
clamp on chambers and you can measure

217
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,699
quickly measure the photosynthesis of

218
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:46,699
the leaf so we get points in this curve

219
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:52,139
what do we get out here

220
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:57,928
what's the photosynthesis and a typical

221
00:12:52,139 --> 00:13:03,318
rate is 30 and this has units of micro

222
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:09,028
moles of carbon per meter squared per

223
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:12,978
second of leaf so down here we have a

224
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:16,048
thousand joules per meter squared per

225
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:19,169
second same thing so the meter squared

226
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:22,318
per second perfectly lines up now we can

227
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:25,318
calculate efficiency of photosynthesis

228
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:34,578
with appropriate units conversion in

229
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:34,578
this energy and energy out so efficiency

230
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:49,159
is output over input real simple we've

231
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:54,198
just got to get these in the same units

232
00:13:49,159 --> 00:14:04,480
so we can make this calculation so if we

233
00:13:54,198 --> 00:14:08,479
have let's go over here output out in

234
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,629
thousand watt I'm gonna skip right to

235
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:22,069
thousand joules per meter squared per

236
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:23,500
second 30 micro moles of what we measure

237
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:27,860
is co2

238
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,649
disappearing per meter squared per

239
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,629
second under a big line so obviously our

240
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:37,519
meter squirts and our seconds are gone

241
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:40,159
and the output is moles of co2 that have

242
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,278
gone into the leaf and the input is

243
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:47,269
joules of energy we can't do an

244
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:52,578
efficiency yet we've got to get this in

245
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:58,220
units of energy so from our equation

246
00:14:52,578 --> 00:15:01,219
which I wrote up here co2 I'm gonna skip

247
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,949
here becomes C h2o

248
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,399
I'll put that put all of it up here

249
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:12,259
water plus oxygen this is elegant

250
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:16,399
because one mole of CO 2 becomes 1 mole

251
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:20,179
of carbohydrate over here so we're

252
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:24,019
measuring the uptake of co2 but we know

253
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:27,198
there's a one-to-one relationship with

254
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:31,159
moles of carbon that disappear and moles

255
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:37,208
of carbon that are fixed in sugar in the

256
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:45,669
leaf so now we can take this times the

257
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:52,479
joules of energy in a mole of carbon

258
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:55,939
I'm gonna just say a mole of ch2oh and

259
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:02,350
with this the numerator becomes joules

260
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:02,350
and the denominator becomes joules and

261
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:09,110
this number this is a number you can

262
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:18,220
look up in a book the energy in sucrose

263
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:19,370
and this is 480 kilojoules per mole of

264
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,990
ch2oh

265
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:27,289
I'm going to give you a handout here to

266
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:29,060
make sure I get the unit's right so this

267
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:32,629
is micro moles so now we're keeping

268
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:36,919
track of this 30 times 10 to the minus

269
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:40,278
sixth moles times this and now the moles

270
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:43,490
cancel 30 times 480

271
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:48,379
I couldn't write that down here 30 times

272
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:50,889
4 80 not going to keep track of the

273
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,889
prefix

274
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:08,700
this is 14.4 joules that the units come

275
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:12,599
from up here divided by a thousand

276
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:17,420
joules that of energy it took to fix

277
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,419
that amount of carbohydrate so

278
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:29,909
photosynthesis in full sunlight of the

279
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:32,910
healthy leaf everything going for it one

280
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:36,120
to two percent so that five percents

281
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:38,340
even a little high average for most

282
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,529
leaves it would only get to five percent

283
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,149
in lower light metals and most of these

284
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:49,490
calculations were doing high light

285
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:51,720
that's why we say we can we can ignore

286
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:58,019
photosynthesis and here's what I just

287
00:17:51,720 --> 00:18:01,110
wrote on the board in a worked out

288
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:03,930
example with with this and there's the

289
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:07,349
efficiency and down here one point four

290
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:10,259
four now it's a right away I made a

291
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:14,519
mistake I tell people never to do this

292
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:17,279
model has really assumed inputs we're

293
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,400
assuming 30 and then I wrote the answer

294
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,019
to three significant digits you know I

295
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,790
should really say one to two or

296
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:28,170
something down here but we all do that

297
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,329
and it helps to show that

298
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,420
this implies you can make quite a

299
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:35,819
precise calculation and you can if you

300
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,560
have accurate if you knew this was

301
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:40,919
precisely a thousand and you knew that

302
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,470
was precisely 30 but the point of this

303
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,720
is you can it's not difficult to

304
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:51,450
calculate the energy going into

305
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:54,870
photosynthesis okay now let's focus on

306
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:58,210
this radiation component here and since

307
00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:04,259
we all get the handout and it's up here

308
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:04,259
take this off take photosynthesis off

309
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:20,019
there's one other aspect of modeling

310
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,288
that's significant here you could say

311
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:25,450
and people do wait a minute we can

312
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:29,829
measure photosynthesis um I'll change

313
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,750
this now to two percent and and maybe

314
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:34,509
this is more like one percent for

315
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,730
respiration and people say well wait a

316
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,569
minute we can measure that we can put it

317
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,450
in the model

318
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:43,089
every time you add coefficients to the

319
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,069
model and add complexity you have a

320
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,990
greater chance of making errors on the

321
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:49,058
primary thing it's kind of like writing

322
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,278
down significant digits if you get too

323
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:54,339
worried about the third or fourth

324
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:56,880
significant digit in a model you can

325
00:19:54,339 --> 00:20:00,668
make errors on the big picture thing and

326
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,850
in my experience it's a lot better to

327
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:05,679
get the big numbers correct and really

328
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:08,619
analyze them and don't worry about the

329
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,139
small stuff until you really need to

330
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:15,209
until you're really trying to get three

331
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:19,740
or four significant digits in the answer

332
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:23,700
so this little graph is worth really

333
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:27,159
remembering both the peak of the day and

334
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,769
the integrated total because we go back

335
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,370
and forth between a daily total for

336
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:36,599
transpiration and an instantaneous value

337
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:40,239
and when our instruments calculate this

338
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:43,058
we do this in one-hour time steps so we

339
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,210
do each number in here and it's also

340
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:48,490
possible to just integrate the whole day

341
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,028
but our data acquisition systems do

342
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:55,690
one-hour time steps so now I'm going to

343
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:59,409
focus on a thousand watts in of

344
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:03,639
shortwave radiation and we're going to

345
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:08,620
model like one hour near solar noon when

346
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:11,459
we have a thousand watts in so this

347
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,459
thousand watts

348
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:18,899
I think I can let's let's get rid of

349
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:24,029
this and come back to some of this stuff

350
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:30,890
I think I can model this to keep my same

351
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:30,889
leaf diagram up here here's the Sun and

352
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,680
we got to have some appropriate color

353
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:40,049
for the Sun and as every school kid

354
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,310
knows this is the appropriate Anatomy

355
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:48,869
for the Sun so the sun's coming in and

356
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:52,319
we have a thousand watts per meter

357
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:57,299
squared hitting that leaf and we'll say

358
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:59,429
this is a 1 meter squared leaf if you

359
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,950
hold the leaf to the Sun you can see

360
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:05,490
light coming through it so light goes

361
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:07,860
through leaves so it's not all absorbed

362
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,620
if you hold the leaf like this and look

363
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:13,429
at it you it you can see light bouncing

364
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:17,729
off it so lights reflected and

365
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:21,390
transmitted and we only have to

366
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:25,799
evaporate enough water to account for

367
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:29,460
what's absorbed by this leaf so we know

368
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:34,589
from lots of years of measurements on

369
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,390
leaves they're all very similar with the

370
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:42,769
exception of really thick leaves like

371
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:56,300
maybe a cactus but of that thousand

372
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:59,299
about 25% bounces off and about 25% is

373
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:59,299
transmitted

374
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:11,490
so suddenly remember our model and we

375
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,790
are off by a factor of 2 between the

376
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:18,380
actual evaporation of water and the

377
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:22,670
input just with this simple analysis if

378
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:29,730
only half is absorbed by the leaf

379
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:33,269
remember we had on one side we had one

380
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,250
point two centimeters a day and then

381
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:38,099
over here we had zero point six

382
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:41,400
centimeters a day this is the measured

383
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:46,379
from pan evaporation all of a sudden if

384
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,550
only half is absorbed our two sides of

385
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,360
our model line up

386
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:53,819
Wow but we're not done it gets bit more

387
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,149
but suddenly there's a big difference

388
00:23:53,819 --> 00:24:03,509
and all we've done so far is account for

389
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:06,929
absorbed radiation so this term when I

390
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:13,460
just said radiation in in a generic

391
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:19,500
sense this has to be our radiation

392
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:22,319
absorbed by the leaf and no equals T

393
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:26,849
plus C squared so now our challenge is

394
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:32,099
to calculate the absorbed radiation by a

395
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:35,579
single leaf or by a community and this

396
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:37,139
is applied to anything I mean your car

397
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:40,859
parked in the Sun we're calculating

398
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,080
absorb radiation to do this but it's a

399
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:47,099
key first step because you can see from

400
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:49,649
this the absorb can be half of what's

401
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:55,289
incident and our it's not difficult to

402
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:58,530
measure the incident coming in these are

403
00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,920
little harder we model them and we

404
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:04,849
measure them both depending on the

405
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,850
situation so

406
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:20,759
let's take this and erase this let's

407
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:23,890
take this 25% reflected when we

408
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:26,470
calculate energy balance for the planet

409
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:30,000
Earth for anything we're measuring

410
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:33,220
reflected radiation and you can look up

411
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,069
characteristic reflectances of surfaces

412
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,870
all kinds of surfaces you can look up

413
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:42,069
the piece of white paper you can look up

414
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:45,909
a piece of black paper and so because

415
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:51,960
this is so common in calculations we've

416
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:51,960
got a unique name for it albedo and

417
00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:03,210
that's the fraction of reflected

418
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,210
radiation

419
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:21,369
so we've just said for a typical leaf

420
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:26,180
25% as a as a round number if we did

421
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:34,849
let's say what's the albedo of a black

422
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:38,890
piece of paper black paper if I drew a

423
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:38,889
little thing and colored it in all black

424
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:47,899
it's about I'm gonna get rid of my zero

425
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:50,839
it's about 10 percent albedo is a

426
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:54,620
expressed typically as a decimal

427
00:26:50,839 --> 00:27:05,449
fraction not as a percent so black paper

428
00:26:54,619 --> 00:27:08,509
0.1 white paper maybe 0.9 so there's

429
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,779
some pretty extremes and leaves are in

430
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:16,779
the middle somewhere around 25% so I

431
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,779
have

432
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:26,788
a handout showing typical values for

433
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:41,829
some common surfaces see if we can get

434
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:44,200
that on there nice and straight and this

435
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:48,519
is where we get into that's for here's

436
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,250
white paper and black paper and well

437
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,079
this is really black paper I put point

438
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,919
oh five this paper might be sort of

439
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:59,889
charcoal if it got up to 0.1 and in this

440
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,960
paper well I had super white paper here

441
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,409
and this was a little off light so it's

442
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,970
0.8 but you get the idea never mind this

443
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:10,570
column just yet we're going to get to

444
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:15,490
that here's a flat leaf 25 now plant

445
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:18,158
community if a leaf is 25% okay fine but

446
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,109
now a plant community we got leaves at

447
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,919
all kinds of angles and the light

448
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:26,859
bounces around so typically a plant

449
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,259
community is a little bit less than a

450
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:31,298
single leaf because of vertical leaves

451
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:36,519
and bouncing it absorbs the light

452
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:38,710
slightly better aluminum foil up there

453
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:44,168
pretty close to white paper they both

454
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:46,269
reflect light pretty well in fact I've

455
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:48,280
been in a lot of discussions with growth

456
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:50,079
chamber manufacturers what's the best

457
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:53,678
color for the inside of a growth chamber

458
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:57,069
should it be reflective mylar or should

459
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,360
it be white and there it's pretty

460
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:06,210
academic they're both about the same

461
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:11,319
human skin that's a good comparison 50%

462
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:15,480
reflectance from our skin which brings

463
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,480
me to an interesting sidebar

464
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:24,200
this little graph is an example out of

465
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:34,589
Campbell &amp; Norman's book biophysical

466
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:38,190
plant physiology I physically in

467
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:41,519
Antarctica and the energy balance of a

468
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,559
person in Antarctica how big of a coat

469
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,029
that they have to wear yellow here you

470
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,309
get to go out and it's a little chilly

471
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:50,129
I'll go change clothes I'll Antarctica

472
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:52,500
you have to know how cold is gonna be so

473
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,420
what color should the coat be what's the

474
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,049
energy balance of the person working

475
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,789
outside in a super cold condition and

476
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:01,769
here's this chest in the Sun and he's in

477
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:03,569
the shade and I won't go through all the

478
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:06,389
details but there's an application of

479
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:09,720
energy balance and now let's take that

480
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:11,940
to the limit I've had the wonderful

481
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,519
experience of working with NASA people

482
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,080
and listening to lots of seminars now

483
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,819
we're gonna have a person go into outer

484
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:22,409
space on a extra-vehicular trip and you

485
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,589
don't get to go say it's a little chilly

486
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:28,230
I'll come in and put on thicker gloves

487
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:30,179
they have to know how that person's

488
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,890
going to work and imagine getting every

489
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,890
single finger at just the right

490
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:37,110
temperature in this suit and the physics

491
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,100
are different there's no air so

492
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:43,769
conduction and convection is zero and

493
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:46,589
there's no transpiration they have to do

494
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:49,349
everything by radiation balance these

495
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:52,859
numbers are both zero so the radiation

496
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:54,449
in has to equal the radiation out for

497
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:58,439
this spacesuit

498
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:00,750
and and that's true of if you're on the

499
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,000
surface of the Moon there's no air so

500
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,980
this is all radiation balance and

501
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,289
there's it's just an interesting example

502
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:12,289
of applications of these principles

503
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:19,459
snow is a big deal look fresh clean snow

504
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,879
as soon as it gets little old it drops

505
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,740
off that has a lot to do with hydrology

506
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,510
and calculating how fast the snow is

507
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,019
going to melt in the spring and come

508
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,809
down

509
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:32,629
how car white is the snow doesn't take

510
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:35,899
much to drop that albedo of the snow and

511
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:39,610
this drops 10% more Energy's going into

512
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:44,000
the snow this also brings us to a

513
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:46,099
theoretically perfect black body which

514
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,410
is a black disc and that has an albedo

515
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:51,379
by definition of zero point zero zero

516
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:53,480
and if we ran if it's theoretically

517
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:57,230
perfect you could put ten zeros on this

518
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:00,170
would still be it's zero our radiometers

519
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:02,420
are designed to have a black disc that's

520
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,279
as close to theoretically perfect as

521
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,860
possible and you look at that little

522
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,139
black disc and it's supposed to look

523
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:10,459
like it's a hollow cavity like there's

524
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,860
nothing there you could put your finger

525
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,319
in the hole if we had a theoretically

526
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:18,139
perfect black body here it would look

527
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,700
like some giant tube that was like a

528
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,900
black hole and it looked like you could

529
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,350
put your hand right in it because

530
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,090
there's nothing there so it's rare we

531
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:29,209
ever get anything that good but we

532
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:31,250
aspire to make this albedo of those

533
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:36,380
black surfaces as close to zero as

534
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:37,670
possible so we're coming I'm going to

535
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,220
come to this and I'm going to come to

536
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:43,730
this in a minute but there's the concept

537
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,759
of albedo and it's easy to look up the

538
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:51,849
internet that albedo is for all kinds of

539
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,849
surfaces because this is such a big deal

540
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:12,319
here's a pyrometer measuring son-in and

541
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:14,839
if we take one like this we could

542
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,819
measure reflected out and this

543
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:21,079
instrument with one turned upside down

544
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:24,069
is called an albedo meter that's and you

545
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:28,279
can purchase these and characterize

546
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:29,839
surfaces so we for double the money you

547
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,329
can measure it and if you don't have a

548
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:35,569
lot of money you model it and your but

549
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:43,779
it's a critical parameter their fraction

550
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:43,779
of reflected radiation so

551
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:01,869
this before I know let me let me move

552
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:05,809
now from I'm gonna race this albedo

553
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:08,829
because we we've all got that nailed and

554
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:08,829
the albedo meter

555
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:21,019
so now let's break down radiation

556
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:41,409
absorbed equals radiation in times

557
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:52,869
albedo no let me take one more step here

558
00:34:41,409 --> 00:35:00,550
radiation short wave SW that's that's in

559
00:34:52,869 --> 00:35:06,250
times albedo this other marker is

560
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:12,560
slightly better times albedo is

561
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:14,179
radiation shortwave ABS absorbed let me

562
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,809
give you a handout that shows us all

563
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:25,009
worked out so we got one component of

564
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:30,440
this for absorbed radiation but in a

565
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:38,840
single leaf albedo is only this fraction

566
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:41,349
here so we need to put a number in here

567
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,680
that accounts for both absorbed and

568
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:50,599
transmitted so typically we have

569
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:55,039
radiation shortwave in or incident

570
00:35:50,599 --> 00:36:00,920
radiation times and the number we're

571
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:03,190
going to put in here is 0.5 because it

572
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,730
accounts for both transmission and

573
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,730
incident arc

574
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:23,730
yes thank you well it's fraction

575
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,730
reflected yep yep abde Oh

576
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:34,899
so now we got 50% absorbed and if we're

577
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:39,309
going to assume this a thousand coming

578
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:45,450
in here if this one's a thousand times

579
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:50,460
0.5 now we have absorbed radiation and

580
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:53,460
500 watts per meter squared of shortwave

581
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,309
we have not yet done long wave radiation

582
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:00,909
but this is the powerhouse of the

583
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:03,719
shortwave coming in from the Sun at

584
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:03,719
solar noon

585
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:13,809
there's one thing that we typically add

586
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:19,770
to this to make the model a bit more

587
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:24,519
accurate you can you can ignore this but

588
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:28,659
almost always there is additional

589
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:31,110
radiation coming into that leaf from

590
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:31,109
reflection

591
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,050
it comes off of clouds and bounces on

592
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:43,500
the leaf and it comes off the ground and

593
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:46,920
bounces on the leaf so in this case if

594
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:54,838
we're assuming a leaf over ground

595
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:59,400
especially wet ground moist soil 10% so

596
00:37:54,838 --> 00:38:02,759
if that a beater was ten percent if it's

597
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:08,880
moist soil now we have a thousand coming

598
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:14,930
in tens percent one hundred watts per

599
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:27,390
meter square so five hundred plus

600
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:29,519
radiation shortwave reflected so now we

601
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:31,679
have six hundred watts per meter squared

602
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,750
of radiation coming in on this leaf to

603
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,608
deal with that we're trying to either

604
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:40,858
see they're going to heat the leaf up or

605
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:44,298
evaporate water this is the end of the

606
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:44,298
shortwave radiation part

607
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:52,429
when yes as soon as these leaves cover

608
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:57,739
the ground this reflection goes to

609
00:38:52,429 --> 00:39:00,429
virtually zero only that this this is a

610
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:04,639
still put this in as a component because

611
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:06,828
if there's clouds next to the Sun you

612
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,078
easily can get ten percent off the

613
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:12,048
clouds so that's you can it can come

614
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,289
from cloud to a another way I might have

615
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:18,139
drawn this different arrow but here's a

616
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:21,079
cloud over here I could have drawn it

617
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:24,618
like that and it's still reflection and

618
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:27,289
that would be the case for a full canopy

619
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:30,369
this goes to zero which allows me to

620
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:34,999
make a key point here

621
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:37,849
lots of people panic when they find

622
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:40,669
their radiation measurements go above a

623
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:43,778
thousand you just told me a thousand is

624
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:47,599
clear sun at solar noon and I've get in

625
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:50,568
1300 your instrument must be wrong is

626
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,088
that a partly cloudy date well yeah and

627
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:59,119
are the clouds on the size of the Sun

628
00:39:53,088 --> 00:40:02,028
yeah okay we have seen 30 as high as 30

629
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,548
percent reflected off of clouds that's

630
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:07,009
really high but 10% off of clouds this

631
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:08,630
happens all the time so all of a sudden

632
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:10,460
their measurements spike and there's

633
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:15,528
nothing wrong with the instrument its

634
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:19,249
reflection off of clouds after we drill

635
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:21,170
people about a clear sky number we often

636
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:22,998
fail to tell them that it can be higher

637
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,900
than clear sky when the clouds are like

638
00:40:22,998 --> 00:40:28,488
a lands and they and they focus it of

639
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,048
course that also has to do with people

640
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:31,489
setting a range of their data logger you

641
00:40:30,048 --> 00:40:32,900
want to make sure your data logger is

642
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:37,460
capable of measuring

643
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:41,920
numbers higher than a thousand so this

644
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:45,499
is the story with shortwave radiation

645
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,950
from the measurement of incident in to

646
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:51,348
absorbed and in this particular example

647
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:55,818
we get a thousand in and six hundreds

648
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:59,390
absorb now obviously this can vary but

649
00:40:55,818 --> 00:41:02,670
it it's an example and it's

650
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:09,619
roughly half to two-thirds of the total

651
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:13,829
coming in but this is only shortwave

652
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:24,599
radiation which is the energy coming

653
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:29,069
from the Sun when we look at let me draw

654
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:33,869
this up here if we put the blinds down

655
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:36,510
in this room so no shortwave came in we

656
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:39,989
would still have fluxes of long-wave

657
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:43,290
radiation and long wave radiation comes

658
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:45,389
from warm objects not not as hot as the

659
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:48,599
Sun but warm objects and it's

660
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:53,279
proportional to the temperature of the

661
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:57,289
objects so if you have two objects in

662
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:00,690
outer space no air no transpiration and

663
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:02,820
one's hotter than the other that energy

664
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:06,090
is going to move by long-wave radiation

665
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:09,150
from the hot one to the cold and these

666
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:11,280
are hundreds of watts per meter squared

667
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,920
of energy transfer by long-wave

668
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:21,110
radiation that we haven't yet accounted

669
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,110
for in this so we need to add that in

670
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,869
let's see what I have for

671
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:49,749
typically and in them in the book in the

672
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:52,539
chapter seven that I'm following from

673
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:57,278
this you can see graphs in there and

674
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:58,959
I'll put this graph over here and let me

675
00:42:57,278 --> 00:43:02,650
let me erase this and put the graph

676
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:10,558
right here we're still at radiation

677
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:14,289
absorbed now we're going to do

678
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:18,939
electromagnetic spectrum and over here

679
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:22,109
is 400 and 700 this whole thing is in

680
00:43:18,938 --> 00:43:23,678
nanometers of the wavelength in

681
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:27,608
nanometers

682
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:32,459
this is photosynthetic radiation which

683
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:35,048
we'll come to and if we make a curve of

684
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:38,068
the energy from the Sun it looks

685
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:45,938
something like this and this is

686
00:43:38,068 --> 00:43:47,739
shortwave this looks like this above the

687
00:43:45,938 --> 00:43:50,228
Earth's atmosphere there's no absorption

688
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:58,929
bands in this yet for water vapor and

689
00:43:50,228 --> 00:44:03,098
and co2 out here we get a curve that

690
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:06,369
looks something like that less intensity

691
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:15,219
but a really long area and this is long

692
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:23,729
wave so this dividing line right here we

693
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:26,199
typically take as 3,000 nanometers or 3

694
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:28,989
micrometers the difference between short

695
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:31,838
wave and long wave now I've roughly

696
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:34,119
drawn this to scale because it's the

697
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:39,719
area under these curves that drives the

698
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:42,789
energy and the area under this curve is

699
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,499
roughly the same or maybe a little less

700
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:48,929
than the area under this curve so a long

701
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:48,928
wave transfer is a is a big deal

702
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:58,889
this yes this is only thermal radiation

703
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,840
this is happening in a darkroom you

704
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:03,569
would never get photosynthesis it only

705
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:08,280
it warms up the leaf but it absolutely

706
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:13,920
doesn't Drive photosynthesis well I'm on

707
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:18,720
this it's let's let's analyze shortwave

708
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:22,980
radiation for a minute if we take 400

709
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:25,529
and 700 nanometers right here this is

710
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:31,199
very close to the wavelengths that our

711
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:33,090
human eyes can see 400 is purple and 700

712
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,980
is deep red it's like the burner on a

713
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,690
stove you can tell it's light but you

714
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,490
wouldn't want to read a book by it it's

715
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:44,880
it's these are the wavelengths we can

716
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:50,819
see and this area under here is about 42

717
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,619
percent of the total depends on sky

718
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:56,220
conditions but there's a rule of thumb

719
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:58,109
about 42 percent drives photosynthesis

720
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:01,469
it's one of the reasons photosynthesis

721
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:04,230
is so inefficient it's all this thermal

722
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:06,480
radiation from the Sun out here that

723
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,960
doesn't drive photosynthesis but it

724
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,079
counts as heat and it warms the leaf up

725
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:19,980
this part here this tiny part of course

726
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:23,909
is ultraviolet and this is about 6% of

727
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:30,199
the total then I could show this part in

728
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:30,199
red this is infrared

729
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:46,079
INF infra-red this there we go this this

730
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:52,259
red markers better infrared out here and

731
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,259
generally this zone in here we called

732
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,839
near-infrared because it's close to the

733
00:46:55,179 --> 00:47:05,549
visible so that's all this part in here

734
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:11,559
and it's 42 this is roughly half or like

735
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:14,590
52% of the total radiation so these are

736
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:18,250
three key components of shortwave and

737
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:23,550
all this analysis so far just took lump

738
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:23,550
them all together for them for the three

739
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:32,289
because the shape of this curve is

740
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:38,170
important and out here is where we get

741
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:41,980
dips black line showing absorption of

742
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:47,980
water vapor and co2 big dips in this

743
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:49,719
band this this is that there's a big

744
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,820
difference between the extraterrestrial

745
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,349
curve and what we measure on the surface

746
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,700
and of course our instruments measure

747
00:47:53,349 --> 00:48:01,779
what's on the surface and because this

748
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:05,559
is a everybody many people here might

749
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:12,930
have seen this magnet oh I need one to

750
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:12,929
show not my things we've made this

751
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,970
magnet some years ago to help show the

752
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:20,829
shape of this curve and now with the

753
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:25,989
wonders of this technology I can make

754
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:27,699
this magnet like big and here's this

755
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:31,869
curve at the surface of the earth and

756
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:34,929
it's shown in two forms the units over

757
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:37,900
here are the energy flux joules per

758
00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:39,579
meter squared per second and now they're

759
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,920
per nanometers so it just each

760
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:44,480
individual wavelength and that's the red

761
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,059
line here's the UV

762
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,639
is a big jump right here at 400 here's

763
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:51,920
the visible up to 700 which is

764
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,559
photosynthetic photon flux which is what

765
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,710
the plants can use separate instruments

766
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,420
to measure this and then the rest of it

767
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:02,150
out here now you can start to see bigger

768
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:08,450
energy bands this only goes to a

769
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:12,079
thousand and to complete the curve this

770
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:14,480
should go to 3000 and this this tapers

771
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,450
off there's less and less energy out

772
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,550
here but and you can see the tapering

773
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:22,549
but this doesn't drop right there it

774
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:26,869
keeps tapering out so this is a useful

775
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:29,420
magnet because it shows up both ways we

776
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:32,650
can calculate the photon flux from this

777
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:35,200
and that's a different shape of a curve

778
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:38,510
so the photon flux is what drives

779
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:41,838
photosynthesis in between here and the

780
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:44,869
energy flux is what drives transpiration

781
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,539
I see the Sun lots of people's filing

782
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:49,430
cabinets in their offices in different

783
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:53,539
places and that was measured here in

784
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:55,818
Logan at our elevation noon solar noon

785
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:58,460
on the summer solstice so it's slightly

786
00:49:55,818 --> 00:50:00,469
different at different times of the year

787
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,909
but it gives a reference on the

788
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:03,909
brightest time of the year

789
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:13,650
while I'm on this we're not going to

790
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:17,789
talk about photosynthesis per se in this

791
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:20,849
class but our instruments measure both

792
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:27,630
of these and we go back and forth

793
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:42,900
between energy and photons with Planck's

794
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:45,809
equation energy is HC over the

795
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:50,369
wavelength speed of light Planck's

796
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:54,360
constant and the wavelength and the key

797
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:58,730
part of this is energy is inversely

798
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,730
proportional to the wavelength of light

799
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,079
I've got a handout with this worked out

800
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:07,050
and I don't have it with me today so

801
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,059
I'll come back to this but it helps us

802
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:13,260
go back and forth between energy and

803
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:15,659
photons calculating and in both units

804
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,910
and it's it's helpful to show a worked

805
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:21,389
out example of this and I'm I'll throw

806
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:26,399
it next time so there's our solar curve

807
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:29,539
with absorption bands for for some of

808
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,539
the factors in here

809
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:37,139
now let's do long wave radiation and

810
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:43,400
I've just got a few minutes left before

811
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:43,400
the hours up long wave is governed I

812
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:50,569
better leave that up here

813
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:04,108
hmm one other key handout I made for us

814
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:16,028
zoom out here it is this is shortwave

815
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:19,538
and long-wave radiation that I drew

816
00:52:16,028 --> 00:52:24,579
right here above the Earth's atmosphere

817
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:28,690
and at sea level yeah this is 1.5 air

818
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:30,160
mass is the depth of air that the

819
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,710
sunlight comes through if the Sun was

820
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:35,108
perfectly overhead that'd be one but

821
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:38,798
it's rarely as it perfectly overhead

822
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:41,920
it's at some angle so 1.5 is a typical

823
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:45,190
amount of air for the Sun to shine

824
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,180
through and that's what 1.5 mm has is if

825
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:51,940
it's in the winter this can be really

826
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:54,639
low angles it can be three be heavily

827
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,559
filtered at really low angles so here's

828
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:59,078
these absorption bands and you can see

829
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:04,509
how tiny the radiation gets out here

830
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:06,930
it's mostly absorbed above 2.5 this is

831
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:09,460
long wave and there's lots of

832
00:53:06,929 --> 00:53:12,848
atmospheric absorption of long wave

833
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:15,818
radiation a perfect black body curve and

834
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:21,479
then the absorption at different

835
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:21,478
wavelengths here so

836
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:29,129
we would like to know the amount of long

837
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:31,710
wave radiation hitting things we measure

838
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:36,390
this with the blackbody parameter or

839
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:39,630
some type of pyro na meter long wave we

840
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:43,650
can also measure with an instrument

841
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:47,400
called a per G ometer but we can also

842
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:51,480
calculate it from surface temperature

843
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:54,079
and to get that surface temperature

844
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,079
measurement

845
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,340
here we go

846
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:15,489
I love showing this picture of this guy

847
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:17,829
we go to Ludwig Boltzmann this is from a

848
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:19,299
book I have of the hundred most famous

849
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:21,929
scientists in the world

850
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:24,970
I think Einstein was number one i

851
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:27,789
boltzmann ate it that number 24 in this

852
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:30,879
list and I've really enjoyed reading

853
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:33,519
about some of these people because that

854
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,789
there lots of them are really eccentric

855
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:39,550
that Boltzmann was in and out of insane

856
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:43,150
asylums his whole life and he and he

857
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:48,519
made it to 62 years old and he he only

858
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:53,860
died in 1906 but what a what a crazy guy

859
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:56,050
and I'll I'll show you mocks plunk in

860
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:59,500
this book who was up one of the top

861
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:01,420
scientists mocks Blancas have a

862
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,579
perfectly ordered life I could imagine

863
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,260
him with the perfectly clean desk and

864
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:08,529
nothing out of order he was just a

865
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:13,870
complete opposite of of Boltzmann but

866
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:16,269
Boltzmann gave us what's called this day

867
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:22,239
and any later like a lot of things

868
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:33,340
paired with Stefan the Stefan Boltzmann

869
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:36,039
law and this is the widely used very

870
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:40,390
famous law for long wave radiation and

871
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:43,000
in principle it says energy is

872
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:44,949
proportional to I always put my fish

873
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,969
symbol in here it's proportional to

874
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:53,019
temperature so if the surface gets

875
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:55,269
hotter the energy is more so that's

876
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:57,280
pretty simple so if we know the surface

877
00:55:55,269 --> 00:56:00,309
temperature we know the energy we use

878
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,650
this in Reverse we measure the energy

879
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:04,509
coming off a surface and we say that's

880
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,519
that's got to be the temperature of the

881
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:08,440
surface so we use this both direction

882
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:10,119
sometimes to measure an energy predict

883
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,059
temperature sometimes to measure

884
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:14,500
temperature predict energy has nothing

885
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:17,119
to do with air temperature it's all

886
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:21,590
about surface temperature

887
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:29,389
and to make this better than this simple

888
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:32,960
principle we've got energy equals this

889
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:36,920
Sigma Greek letter Sigma which is the

890
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,840
stefan-boltzmann constant and I've used

891
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:43,519
this enough I can remember this number

892
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:48,920
it's five point six seven times ten to

893
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:56,900
the minus eighth watts per meter squared

894
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:59,630
per Kelvin so here's the big

895
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:03,050
significance of this Wow 10 to the minus

896
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:04,579
eighth you know this has to be Kevin

897
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,190
it's a big number but this this is a

898
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:11,119
really small exponent and lots of these

899
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:13,820
constants in our equations have some

900
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,400
really tiny some really big exponents

901
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:18,920
but here's the amazing thing about this

902
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,990
all kinds of our equations have squared

903
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,860
something squared or the square root of

904
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:27,319
something this is the only equation I

905
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:30,200
know that has temperature this is by the

906
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:34,760
way temperature in Kelvin to make this

907
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:40,429
units cancel its temperature to the

908
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:42,880
fourth power so it's really a nonlinear

909
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:46,369
relationship with temperature but

910
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,470
because it's Kelvin it's we're going

911
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:51,380
from room temperatures three hundred

912
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:54,409
Kelvin so three hundred times to the

913
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:57,230
fourth power to maybe three hundred and

914
00:57:54,409 --> 00:58:00,219
five to the fourth power but this is the

915
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,219
relationship

916
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:20,969
setup is this available energy we didn't

917
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:23,849
good question we didn't get into how

918
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:28,019
much of this is absorbed yet which we

919
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:31,500
need to this is the tonal energy

920
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:34,019
transmitted not all of this is absorbed

921
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:39,329
as if this is a key point but first

922
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:42,000
we'll talk about what's coming off I've

923
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:43,559
got one handout and then I'm gonna stop

924
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,730
and we're gonna pick this up next time

925
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:50,239
and here we go

926
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:55,740
always good when I can find my handouts

927
00:58:50,239 --> 00:59:00,589
this is so there's enough exponents in

928
00:58:55,739 --> 00:59:03,239
this here's a worked out example

929
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:08,070
stefan-boltzmann law of equation right

930
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:10,289
there 273.15 - Kevin so we put this to

931
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:13,619
make it easy to do in a surface

932
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:15,989
temperature in Celsius and then you put

933
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:18,240
it in an Excel spreadsheet and you run

934
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:23,189
it and here's the emitted radiation

935
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:26,639
coming off a surfaces from minus 40 to

936
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:28,740
plus 80 hot surface of a car might get

937
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:30,989
the plus 80 or something really hot in

938
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:34,229
the Sun look at the numbers now that's

939
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:44,459
this is just three columns radiation

940
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:54,019
emitted 25 degrees C 448 so as a rule of

941
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:54,019
thumb this leaf is 25 C so

942
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:07,789
448 watts per meter squared is being

943
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:10,730
given off by long wave radiation so all

944
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:16,940
of a sudden we had 600 watts of

945
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:19,340
shortwave absorbed Wow 448 is is given

946
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:21,260
off by long wave all of a sudden this

947
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:24,550
leaf doesn't have to evaporate that much

948
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:27,860
water because a long wave emission

949
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:29,230
now here's then here's the thing that

950
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:34,280
we'll pick up next time

951
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:37,639
long wave works both ways the leaf is

952
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:40,460
giving it off to the environment but

953
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:45,129
down here we have ground and let's say

954
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:51,980
the ground is 25 C now we have to count

955
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:54,500
+ 448 coming in so if the ground

956
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:58,969
temperature and the leaf are the same

957
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:02,210
this net long-wave radiation cancels out

958
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:06,589
and it's a small number that's the

959
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:12,559
simple basics next time we'll talk about

960
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:15,800
a little letter right here e which is

961
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:18,500
emissivity and what does different

962
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,630
surfaces emit at different rates it's

963
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:24,050
sort of like albedo only this is

964
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:27,440
emission not reflection so this is a

965
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:30,230
really key component and we'll pick it

966
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,289
up next time next time we should be able

967
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:37,250
to wrap up all the components of long

968
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:40,670
wave in this and so we have a total

969
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:43,639
absorbed radiation and how to calculate

970
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:46,630
it and then we could move on to these

971
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:46,629
next components

972
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:58,699
yeah you can see the two graphs down

973
01:01:50,958 --> 01:02:02,239
here this is slightly nonlinear because

974
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:04,909
it's T to the fourth and this is the

975
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:10,458
slope of the line so if it could

976
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:13,578
estimate it between two points okay any

977
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:15,708
questions that make an answer about this

978
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:18,739
