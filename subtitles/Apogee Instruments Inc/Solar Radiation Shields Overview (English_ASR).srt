1
00:00:02,408 --> 00:00:08,899
if I'm Bruce Bugbee and this is a

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,510
continuing series of seminars on

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,380
principles of environmental measurement

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:18,410
in this next mini seminar we're going to

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,769
talk about radiation shields how do you

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,589
protect a sensor from solar radiation to

7
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:27,589
shade it to get it to more accurately

8
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:30,109
measure true air temperature now this is

9
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:31,879
something like many things that we

10
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:33,979
thought we knew how to do 10 years ago

11
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:35,839
and we start to do more rigorous tests

12
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:38,359
and then we start to find out the things

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,390
we don't know so we're going to talk

14
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:44,119
about the past eight years of research

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,969
on radiation shields and how we've

16
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:49,789
modified shields and come up with a new

17
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,640
type of shield that uses less power and

18
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,950
is more accurate than the traditional

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,170
things I'm joined in this effort by Mark

20
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,969
Blanc was the chief scientist at Apogee

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,210
he and I have been doing tests on this

22
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:06,739
in many places over a lot of time to get

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,748
this data so let's take a look at the

24
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:11,328
types of shields now here's a great

25
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:15,498
picture of these shields against the sky

26
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:17,809
and it summarizes the five types of

27
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:20,629
shields I'm going to talk about in here

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,060
this is at an angle so there's a little

29
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:24,888
bit of wide angle distortion here but

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,950
let's go through them here's the

31
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:30,348
shield's that everybody is familiar with

32
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,189
we called these multi plate shields

33
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:36,109
they're also called passive shields or

34
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:40,248
static shields there's no moving parts

35
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:41,809
they rely on the wind to cool it off the

36
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:44,149
winds supposed to go through them and

37
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,418
it's supposed to shade the Sun they've

38
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:50,168
been used on hundreds of thousands of

39
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:52,429
weather stations over many decades now

40
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:55,009
let's look at how accurate they are

41
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:58,728
compared to improvements there's one

42
00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:01,478
type this is one made by Met spec in in

43
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:04,578
England there's a second type right here

44
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,888
which is made by our M young these are

45
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:09,618
come in multiple Heights we used ones

46
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:13,989
that are tall so the very best of this

47
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:17,449
technology but we compared it to three

48
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:20,569
active shields that have a fan in them

49
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:22,518
and it's pretty simple if you have a fan

50
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:25,429
blowing over something it doesn't heat

51
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,310
up in the Sun the way a static shield

52
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,989
does so as you can imagine if the Sun is

53
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:36,109
bright and the wind is not blowing these

54
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,390
heat up above air temperature and with

55
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:42,170
the fan the problem is greatly

56
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:45,708
diminished so in this series of tests

57
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:48,938
I'm going to show you we looked at the

58
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:51,378
meant one shield which is a long tube

59
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:54,019
it's actually the biggest of the three

60
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:56,840
shields and the inlet to the air comes

61
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:59,389
in the bottom right there and then the

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,209
outlet of the air comes out the top up

63
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:05,989
here the second shield we looked at is

64
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:09,079
the RM young shield again the air is

65
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:14,289
coming in the bottom blowing out the top

66
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:17,989
and the third shield we looked at is an

67
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:20,150
Apogee fan aspirated shield same thing

68
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,099
airs coming in the bottom and out the

69
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,539
top so we'll look at the data and then

70
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:26,418
we'll look at some of the physical

71
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:30,500
principles that result in air

72
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:32,449
temperature so after years of work and

73
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,329
refining that design the next step is

74
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:38,299
field testing and we've tested these now

75
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,810
in multiple locations so before I show

76
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:43,219
you the data let's look at the locations

77
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,680
one of the first test sites is at

78
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:48,199
Campbell scientific here in Logan Utah

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,989
and here's the multiple replicates

80
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,840
shields you can see in this screen net

81
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,780
spec shields small multi plates big

82
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,959
multi plates here's the Apogee shield

83
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,109
right there here's an RM young shield

84
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,699
there compared to all these other ship

85
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:07,699
and look at it and here's the anemometer

86
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:10,040
for wind speed so this is one of the

87
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,620
test sites run over an extended period

88
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,989
of time to look at differences in

89
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,329
measurement accuracy caused by shields

90
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,358
now these all have accurate temperature

91
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:24,848
sensors inside them to make this a fair

92
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:27,769
comparison next site is Apogee 's

93
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,628
backyard which is a

94
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,948
more extensive tests you can see all

95
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:33,439
these along a plane

96
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:37,750
here's replica Apogee shields there's

97
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:40,129
many of them here's the net one shield

98
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,439
here's the arm young shield

99
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,780
there's many replica shields in this

100
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,209
this is in a line but we filtered the

101
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:50,568
data for only when it was crosswinds

102
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:52,609
to get more precise data out of this

103
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,740
test all run off a single weather

104
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,009
station this example of some of the

105
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,408
testing we've done third site is

106
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:03,169
Campbell scientific England same thing

107
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:06,319
here's the RM young here's the Apogee

108
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:09,019
whole bunch of static shields in this

109
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,150
test all hooked up to a common data

110
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:13,930
logger run over a long period of time to

111
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:16,388
test for differences among shields

112
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,590
another site is the Utah State

113
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,168
University campus environmental

114
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:22,728
Observatory which is a solar powered

115
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:25,120
station right in the middle of campus

116
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:27,968
and here's a static shield and here's an

117
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,149
Apogee shield in comparison in that

118
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:35,389
typically we have the inlets of these at

119
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:37,609
the exact same height they're not quite

120
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,310
that way here because the ground is warm

121
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,210
and the higher you go the cooler it is

122
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,370
so this test would slightly favor the

123
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:48,739
static shield over this because this is

124
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,228
lower and this is higher but typically

125
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,038
and all the other tests the inlets were

126
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:57,139
at the exact same height now let's look

127
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,879
at some of the data from these tests

128
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,848
we're going to summarize a lot of data

129
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:05,149
in a few slides here's the raw data

130
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:07,218
these two slides here's the summarized

131
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:09,829
data so let's look at the summarized

132
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:13,069
data first with all all these data

133
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:17,538
points in it this is the temperature

134
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:20,750
rise above the active radiation shield

135
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:24,649
now all three of the active shields were

136
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:28,069
very close to each other so they very

137
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:30,258
close to zero and if the wind is blowing

138
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:34,009
nuts look at two things

139
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:37,759
here's a small thermistor right here the

140
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,360
blue line here is a larger humidity

141
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,189
probe

142
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,848
how do people measure temperature in

143
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:47,899
these a humidity probe so if you have a

144
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:52,310
larger humidity probe you can have one

145
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:55,759
degree see errors in still win if the

146
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:59,889
Sun is out if the wind is three meters a

147
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:03,189
second a gentle breeze you still have

148
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:07,399
you can see about 0.3 degrees C error

149
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:10,069
all the way up to a rigorous breeze

150
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,218
flags would be standing straight out at

151
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:15,348
wind speeds like this it still didn't

152
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:17,199
the humidity probe still didn't get

153
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:21,769
quite to zero

154
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,620
so the small thermistor was better and

155
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:29,329
let's see here if we can erase some of

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:32,899
this this is our new board it's just

157
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:38,389
like the blackboard and only no chalk so

158
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:40,550
now we go to this get back to green now

159
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,769
let's look at this small thermistor much

160
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,250
better because it's small this is a tiny

161
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:48,978
yellow bead thermistor made by Apogee

162
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,370
instruments very tiny look at this at

163
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:54,560
three meters a second now the air gets

164
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,990
less than a tenth of degree C but it's a

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,658
pretty big air below that and finally

166
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,110
this gets very close to zero out here

167
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:05,449
but at high wind speeds this is just the

168
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,848
raw data because these are short time

169
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,319
intervals there's little puffs of wind

170
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:14,718
but the key is that summary they're

171
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,838
small thermistors are more accurate than

172
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:19,610
larger humidity sensors and we'll get

173
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:22,098
back to that but that's a key

174
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,939
distinction because people often just

175
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:29,889
use the humidity sensor to measure these

176
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:35,318
and they use it in a static shield so

177
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:39,168
what's the next data look like this is

178
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:41,870
differences in the static shields this

179
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:44,448
is the RM young shield which is a very

180
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:48,169
widely used shield on weather stations

181
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:50,449
that had the greatest temperature

182
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:53,089
increases in our tests

183
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,460
compared greater increases compared to

184
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,700
the Mets Beck shields Mets Beck has two

185
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:03,320
models here's the one shown in green

186
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:05,660
here's the two shown in blue that mk1

187
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,720
was slightly better but still they

188
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:12,620
didn't get down to zero until there was

189
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,009
a reasonable breeze blowing to cool it

190
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:21,529
off these three showed the raw data all

191
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:23,480
feeding into this summary so shields

192
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:28,600
vary a little bit but even the best

193
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,600
shields had errors in temperature so

194
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,700
what happens in the winter this of

195
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,800
winter is a killer there's snow in the

196
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,890
ground there's low angle light

197
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,649
reflecting up on these shields so the

198
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,899
radiation intensity is focused on the

199
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,959
shield they're not designed to block low

200
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:51,649
angled radiation remember the shield's

201
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,650
have a design that looks like this yeah

202
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:59,169
what happens when the Sun comes in like

203
00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:03,199
that it heats it up gets right inside

204
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:06,110
here's the data for no snow in the

205
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,780
ground this is over vegetative surface

206
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,409
and once the Sun comes out the errors

207
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:15,679
start to approach two degrees C with no

208
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:18,709
wind and they don't go to zero until we

209
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:22,509
get a very stiff breeze blowing on these

210
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:25,790
so the errors are much worse over snow

211
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:29,090
let's take a look now at the small

212
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:37,219
differences between these three types of

213
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:41,240
aspirated shields these are the RM young

214
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,930
shield and the Apogee shield compared to

215
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:48,409
the Met one shield now in our tests the

216
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:50,899
Met one shield read slightly cooler so

217
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:53,600
we use that as the reference here there

218
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:58,340
is no official reference for this at

219
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,029
zero things heat up as the radiation

220
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,910
gets bigger

221
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:09,600
so here's temperature errors in the

222
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:13,439
and they're less than 0.05 degrees see

223
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,230
the apogee shield was slightly better

224
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,800
than the RM young shield for accuracy

225
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:23,399
and in these tests but now look at the

226
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:26,639
winter much worse but remember the

227
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,740
static shields were more than 1 degree C

228
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,850
above air temperature now we've reduced

229
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,129
that error to less than 0.1 degrees C

230
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,889
even in the winter with the reflected

231
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:42,600
light and of course when it's dark

232
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:45,870
there's there's no error at all so these

233
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,960
are all close the apogee shield in these

234
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:53,460
tests performed the RM young shield and

235
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:57,660
was very close to the Met one shield so

236
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:00,269
how does this Apogee shield work one of

237
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,819
the design goals of this was to

238
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,159
dramatically reduce the power to the

239
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:09,090
shield and let's take a side view look

240
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:11,579
at this thing because if you're gonna

241
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,980
run these from a solar powered system

242
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,580
you either need an enormous solar panel

243
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:20,009
or a more efficient design this is the

244
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,490
Apogee design right here inside view

245
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:27,179
filled with foam sensor port adapter

246
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:32,399
right here going to the sensor now this

247
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:35,519
is what's called a Kawana Inlet and it

248
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,250
looks like a jet engine Inlet so that

249
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,069
when the wind is blowing sideways it can

250
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,639
more easily change direction and go up

251
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:47,820
here in the fan and blow out the top of

252
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,789
the shield if this was a square edge

253
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,740
like it was in all of our early tests

254
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:54,559
anytime there was a crosswind we had

255
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,269
problems so we had to go to this

256
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,429
specialized Coanda Inlet coupled with a

257
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:02,399
small sensor in just the right place

258
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:04,439
notice the taper here that's a rocket

259
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,529
nozzle contour to get the wind going

260
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,260
faster and faster over this shield right

261
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:13,019
here these are all critical to the

262
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,769
design and critical to the use of a

263
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,958
small pen here's the whole thing

264
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:21,220
sealed up yours gee Lloyd plastic

265
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:23,138
venturi contour Inlet I mean I mean now

266
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,040
that we're here let me show you some of

267
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:32,110
the component parts here's the fan this

268
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:35,919
is an IP 55 rated fan that's custom

269
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:38,739
built for Apogee ip55 is a measure of

270
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,259
the resistance to water and dust you can

271
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:43,569
spray this van with water and it doesn't

272
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:45,339
hurt it and we have yet to have in spite

273
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:47,229
of now having several hundred of these

274
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,569
in the field and very rugged

275
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,879
environments we have yet to ever have a

276
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:55,088
fan fail and some of them meant up for

277
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:57,639
four years now there it's rated for at

278
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:02,220
least 50,000 hours so this is an

279
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:05,110
exceptionally rugged small low-power fan

280
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,949
this cuándo radius we got up right here

281
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,959
here it is

282
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:13,599
there's the quandary radius so the air

283
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,748
can come right up in here and fan sits

284
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:22,089
right in here and blow out now this this

285
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:26,308
whole thing is covered by hat so that we

286
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:31,319
can shield it from the Sun and water and

287
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:37,178
it's a it's a simple yet elegant design

288
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:43,748
so let's take a look at some performance

289
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:46,480
data here's the quondam one of the you

290
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:49,899
could see the difference in fan size RM

291
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,220
Young 400 milli amp Apogee 80 milliamp

292
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:56,519
this is a five fold reduction in power

293
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:01,059
for the fan so much smaller battery much

294
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,789
smaller solar panel it gets better at

295
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:04,418
night you don't need to run the fan full

296
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:08,458
blast

297
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:10,659
so Apogee is put in a variable speed fan

298
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:15,039
which I'm going to talk about in the

299
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:18,159
next slide but this is the difference in

300
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,948
the quandary radius when the wind is

301
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,100
blowing sideways the RM young got worse

302
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:27,068
and because of that radius the apogee

303
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,830
gets better with slightly better with

304
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:30,379
high wind

305
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:34,550
in spite of a fivefold reduction in

306
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:38,659
speed now let's look at the variable

307
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:42,769
speed fan here it is running full blast

308
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:46,759
80 milliamps with the ratio of 1 at

309
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:50,179
night or on cloudy days with a PWM

310
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:54,200
command we can slow the fan down all the

311
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:56,419
way to 25 milli amps and now the wind

312
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,690
speed is less but the power consumption

313
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:01,490
is much less so it's already a small fan

314
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,800
and we can further optimize it by

315
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,440
slowing it down at night and on cloudy

316
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:10,399
days or on days when the wind is already

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:15,620
high don't need a fan here's the IP 55

318
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:18,528
rating tachometer output so this is a

319
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:21,259
separate wire to the data logger telling

320
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:23,500
the RPMs of this fan if anything gets in

321
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:26,838
there and the fans not working right

322
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,929
will slow it it'll show up and raise a

323
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,110
red flag this is how we save power pulse

324
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:35,509
width modulation from the data

325
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:41,000
acquisition system so there's a top view

326
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:43,189
with a fan right there how do you get

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,809
the sensors in this other shields are

328
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,990
there big to put them in from the top

329
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:50,028
you clamp them in after lots of testing

330
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,370
we found the best way is put them in the

331
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:55,070
side here's the picture here's the

332
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,339
shield the sensors go right in the side

333
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,620
like this it's simple its elegant you

334
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:03,730
can change take out sensors and change

335
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,619
them you can put in multiple sensors

336
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,068
here's a bunch of pictures of what we

337
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,188
call sensor port adapters so if you need

338
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:15,438
one thermistor this is the sensor of

339
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,040
choice if you want to have replicas

340
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,259
there's two replicas three replicates

341
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,688
full replicas thermistors for super

342
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:26,209
precision work it's easy to do these are

343
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,650
cheap and easy to make now what if you

344
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,150
want a humidity probe with it like

345
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,610
everybody does here we go

346
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,940
you buy the model with a humidity probe

347
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:38,509
adapter and that looks like this here's

348
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,669
a picture of that adapter clips writing

349
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:41,490
here quarter-turn snaps into place

350
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,610
Oh

351
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,190
to hold the humidity probe in place so

352
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:50,369
these come in all shapes and sizes to

353
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,820
hold a wide range of sensors here is a

354
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:56,459
picture of one in action it would sit

355
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:58,409
like this in the shield the air is

356
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,329
coming up like this we accurately

357
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,600
measure the temperature there and then

358
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:06,599
the humidity here this is a if I say the

359
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:11,069
HMP 110 shown with how this would go

360
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:13,500
right into the adapter so this is easy

361
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:15,509
to do for a wide range of sensors and

362
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,819
they're easy to take out and clean

363
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:19,769
that's another thing these eventually

364
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:21,599
get dirty and other shields that take a

365
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,490
whole shield apart here you just pop the

366
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,139
sensors out wipe them clean put them

367
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:29,039
right back in that was another design

368
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:34,280
feature that we put into this there's a

369
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:37,200
picture of that in the in the field so

370
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:41,460
these are the air temperature options

371
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,120
for this the Apogee st 110 is that

372
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,819
yellow bead thermistor now many places

373
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,149
call for more precise data with the

374
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:55,200
Platinum resistance thermometer and here

375
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:58,890
is an example of that with a four wire

376
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,190
PRT in that sensor port adapter four

377
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,070
places that require PRT that receive

378
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,420
measurements this is another probe that

379
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:10,470
works fine with it the Campbell

380
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:13,259
scientific 109 a wide range of

381
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:16,350
temperature sensors work fine by Sayla

382
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:19,950
Campbell scientific wrote Ronix EE

383
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:21,629
electronics we it works fine with a wide

384
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,640
range of sensors just with the right

385
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,440
sensor port adapter of course many

386
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,000
people buy more than one sensor port

387
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,400
adapter for future expansion here's a

388
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,700
couple case studies in the field where

389
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,870
this has been used this is the what's

390
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:46,610
called the eye Utah project and they use

391
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:49,500
a lowercase I to be high-tech there's a

392
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:53,279
many of these stations in the mountains

393
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,900
of Utah monitoring snowmelt where

394
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,910
accuracy of air

395
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,160
temperature is everything how fast is

396
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,750
the snowmelt on the spring how fast is

397
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,360
the water run down in the valley if

398
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,250
we're off a tenth of a degree C the

399
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,029
models are wrong we have to have

400
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,460
accuracy

401
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:11,819
there's the apogee seal this by the way

402
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,980
is Apogee heated parinama tur which

403
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:17,069
they've selected for use on this for

404
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,140
extreme winter conditions this is just

405
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:22,109
example up in the mountains the snow

406
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,220
gets deep so this stuff has to be high

407
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:28,169
up one more example is the greenhouse

408
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,779
environment this one happens to be

409
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,590
Roberto Lopez's greenhouse at Purdue

410
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,470
University

411
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:36,509
he ordered multiple Apogee sensors for

412
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,240
precision air temperature measurement

413
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:41,220
over his experimental plots so here they

414
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,009
are with the precision thermistor coming

415
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,789
out and the shield's multiple replica

416
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:51,509
shields hanging in a greenhouse so in

417
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:55,200
summary the apogee shield has been

418
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:58,710
optimized for accuracy and low power and

419
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,549
low cost those three things we think

420
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:05,700
make it a very favorable choice for

421
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:07,909
weather stations when precision air

422
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,299
temperature measurements are important

423
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:14,550
this can replace the old static shields

424
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:17,069
for precision air temperature

425
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,129
measurement and I'll stop there that's

426
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:23,490
the final slide had in the shield

427
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:28,310
measurement series we hope to see again

428
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,309
another measurement seminar thank you
