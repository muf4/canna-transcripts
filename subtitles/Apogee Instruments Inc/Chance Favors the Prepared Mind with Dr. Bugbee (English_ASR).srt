1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:08,339
so today I want to share a talk with you

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,400
that I recently did at the annual

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:15,679
meeting of the American Society of

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,560
agronomy which was in Baltimore Maryland

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:24,000
I was asked by the society to give a

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,219
talk on Serendipity in science how that

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,460
occurs

8
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:31,018
how things how we

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,140
accidental discoveries in science and

10
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,879
how they impact our science

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,200
and of course my immediate thought when

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,420
they asked me to give a Talk about

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,160
serendipity and Sciences so what do you

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,120
would you think my whole career was just

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:48,000
based on log pad luck that's why

16
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:50,159
by here talking and but they said no no

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,980
no we don't think that but but you've

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,558
had some significant discoveries and

19
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,419
we'd like you to talk about how those

20
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:58,679
came about

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,879
so

22
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:06,420
I decided to title my talk Chance favors

23
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,459
the prepared mind and I've always loved

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,799
this quote I first read it when I was in

25
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,559
graduate school and I thought I want to

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,720
dedicate my career to having a prepared

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,478
mind so when those chances come along

28
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,719
they're a big deal

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,420
so this this seems to make pretty

30
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,819
intuitive sense but what's a prepared

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,099
mind really mean

32
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,719
you know an analogy that I thought of is

33
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,798
what if we said

34
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,539
Chance favors the prepared athlete

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,360
well that would make perfect sense

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,460
athletes spend a long time preparing

37
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,618
their minds and bodies for that one

38
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,780
catch in some great game

39
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,420
but that didn't that wasn't luck that

40
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,420
was a lot of skill honed by years of

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,519
practice the same principles relate to

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,240
this with Scientists

43
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,340
the prepared mind means learning all the

44
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,759
principles of your discipline the

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,719
equations that make up your discipline

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,840
the theory the models the literature in

47
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:13,560
your discipline it means really becoming

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,900
a true expert in your discipline that's

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,199
what prepared mind means

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,280
and then when you come along and see the

51
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,459
odd things you're prepared to say hmm

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,280
that could be something right there and

53
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,199
you follow it up lesser people might say

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
now that was bad day to just forget it

55
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:37,079
and move on

56
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,659
so this quote came from Louis Pasteur he

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,000
lived in the 1800s he was a great

58
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,878
philanthropist everybody knows about him

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the germ theory of disease came from

60
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,399
pasture he was he was always working

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,739
with sterile systems it's amazing

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
stories of his life

63
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,599
um

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,580
but

65
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:00,238
when he wrote about this he got the

66
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,300
Nobel Prize when he wrote about this he

67
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,000
didn't have five succinct words to

68
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,120
describe this principle here's what he

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,419
wrote well even before I get to what he

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,700
wrote let's let's take a look and

71
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,399
what a prepared mind might be

72
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:21,119
here's some data right so this is an X

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,700
plot an input variable here's why a

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,780
plant response you get data like this

75
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:31,500
now we would normally

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,759
say the data like that this is this is a

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,519
common

78
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,459
principle for a lot of things so the

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,200
more you get vax this is non-linear you

80
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,759
make measurements you get this point

81
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,280
right here

82
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,340
the first inclination is that must be

83
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,259
bad just throw it out but you measured

84
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,360
it what what happened with that let's

85
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,298
see if I can get back to this you

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,019
measure it just throw it out we have

87
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,080
statistical principles that say this is

88
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,140
so far off the line just forget about it

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,780
you can we can throw it out but there's

90
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,979
an example of something that might be

91
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,080
real

92
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,259
let's take this out here for a second

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,379
that little line right here

94
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:19,439
and we're going to go back to this

95
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,478
now some people might take this and they

96
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:26,040
have a high speed computer

97
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:29,279
and they'll attempt to fit this

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,439
with a 10th order polynomial that looks

99
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,478
like that and now you got to come up

100
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,600
with the principle that says right here

101
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,539
there's a big inhibitory effect of X on

102
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,120
y so just that simple data set alone

103
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,100
gives you a lot of examples of the

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,079
challenges we go through and we make

105
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,419
good measurements very careful

106
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,719
measurements and we're sorting good data

107
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,339
from bad data and and looking for those

108
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,660
anomalies that lead to Great

109
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,539
breakthroughs

110
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,780
pasture didn't

111
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,879
say these five concise words

112
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,519
here's what he originally wrote for his

113
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,639
Nobel Prize

114
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,639
um

115
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,020
in fields of observation Chance favors

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,240
the prepared mind but look at this it's

117
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:18,139
this is true in all Fields not just an

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,139
observation so

119
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:24,000
we can edit that out Chance favors only

120
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,100
the prepared mind and not only that we

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,978
don't need the word only Reddit that out

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,500
too now we get to his quote so pasture

123
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:33,418
like a lot of people had good editors as

124
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,339
as if stuff to make the concise

125
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:39,538
statements and that's part of science

126
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:41,279
the conciseness that leads to new

127
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,599
breakthroughs

128
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,119
so

129
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,680
we often think scientists must say when

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,800
they have a grade through they say ah

131
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,699
Eureka I found it but that's really not

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,740
how science works you rarely get to

133
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,400
something you expected

134
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,379
the most common phrases that's funny and

135
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,179
that's this part that leads to these

136
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,519
great breakthroughs

137
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,978
this came from Isaac Asimov for this

138
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,839
quote and here's a book that I've had on

139
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:13,019
my shelf for years Serendipity

140
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,599
accidental discoveries in science and

141
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,418
this is loaded with examples of

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,340
and and happy accidents that occurred in

143
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:23,159
science it's a it's an interesting book

144
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,779
it's still in print so let's let's take

145
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,560
a deeper look at this

146
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,559
in 1963

147
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,399
Science magazine had an editorial and

148
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,680
the conclusion of the editorial was

149
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,918
Serendipity is not a substitute for hard

150
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,019
work and that's a gold standard in this

151
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,079
they were being criticized you should

152
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,839
just fund the scientists that are lucky

153
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,939
yeah there's not lucky scientists

154
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,459
there's ones that have hard work and

155
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,959
have prepared Minds so they were pushing

156
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,180
back on this

157
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,799
there's an old phrase the harder I work

158
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,860
the luckier I get yeah great but look

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,000
hard work is in here work is in here

160
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,639
work is something you don't like doing

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,860
and in order to do a lot of it and feel

162
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,079
good about it and be creative

163
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,160
you got to do the stuff you like doing

164
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:22,439
you have to like what you do so I always

165
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,199
say just this isn't work this is

166
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,879
something I enjoy and work is something

167
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,598
I don't enjoy

168
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,699
that's one of the keys to doing a lot of

169
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,219
something and then being able to find

170
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,020
the pick out the happy accidents that

171
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,940
occur

172
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,579
so

173
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,139
let's get rid of this

174
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,779
here's another big thing about

175
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,538
statistics statistics is not going to

176
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,939
lead us to Great breakthroughs it helps

177
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:53,459
us determine mathematical probabilities

178
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,500
but I love this quote if your experiment

179
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,779
needs statistics you ought to have done

180
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,579
a better experiment this came from

181
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,638
Ernest Rutherford Nobel Prize in

182
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:05,038
chemistry you can believe he wanted

183
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,079
clean experiments where we didn't need a

184
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,379
lot of reps and he didn't need a lot of

185
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:13,198
Statistics to sort out his results and

186
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:16,139
certainly in our research here we try to

187
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,120
do simple clean experiments so we don't

188
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,120
need a lot of replicates

189
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,139
so

190
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:29,280
the next section of this talk is about

191
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:31,620
this intersection between Theory and

192
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,259
measurement and we get to a point right

193
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,179
there

194
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:39,360
knowledge is really the extent to which

195
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,899
Theory agrees with measurements now

196
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,259
theory is another term for models and

197
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,820
models are equations and if models

198
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,759
predict something and that's what we

199
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,620
measure we get confident that we have it

200
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,220
right

201
00:08:51,620 --> 00:09:00,000
this is in this room up here on a board

202
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,879
by our clock to keep people thinking

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,240
about this and really this quote in here

204
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:09,659
says never believe a measurement unless

205
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,839
it can be substantiated with Theory

206
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:15,059
and conversely the degree of confidence

207
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,380
we can have is the degree to which these

208
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,018
two things agree

209
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,360
so theory is what you learn in school

210
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,220
theory is what prepares your mind and

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,860
measurements what you do in the lab and

212
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,139
you look for when they converge now to

213
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,080
pick out these serendipitous

214
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,899
measurements we need wisdom so it's a

215
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,778
three-way interaction between all three

216
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:39,778
of those things that gets us there

217
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:42,059
so here's another quote

218
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:45,480
that's just striking

219
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:47,939
everybody believes a measurement except

220
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,039
the person that made it now the person

221
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,540
that made it knows how hard it was to

222
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,759
make that measurement and they not sure

223
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,799
they got it right but everybody else

224
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,019
thinks oh no no it's measured it's fine

225
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:02,039
it's it's the gold standard

226
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,539
the corollary to this is nobody believes

227
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,240
a model

228
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,860
except the person who made the model and

229
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,440
the modelers are always saying I have a

230
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,019
model I have a model look it's right and

231
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,920
people say no no so the bottom line of

232
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:20,459
this we should believe measurements less

233
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:23,278
and we should believe models more they

234
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:25,500
put equal weight on both of these to

235
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,320
guide us now the place where I think

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,600
what I think much of this came from is

237
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,339
Back to the Future where they're making

238
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,139
a lot of measurements to go into the

239
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,260
future and they make a lot of models

240
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:40,080
back and forth so it's a nice corollary

241
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:43,080
to this quote

242
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:47,879
so

243
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,800
let's see we'd get this off the slide

244
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,519
the analogy I

245
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:56,699
have used to emphasize this link between

246
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,039
Theory and measurement is getting to the

247
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,000
top of a house

248
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,799
with two ladders and the rules of

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,740
science say you can only have one foot

250
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:11,639
on each ladder and one ladder is

251
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,740
measurement One ladder is theory and you

252
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,319
get to the top of the house fastest when

253
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,480
you put one foot on one rung and back

254
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,519
and forth and back and forth and up you

255
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,519
go on the ladder

256
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,819
if you try to do only measurements you

257
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,379
maybe could get there hopping on one

258
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,540
foot on the ladder but it'd be awfully

259
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,120
hard and only Theory hopping on one foot

260
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:36,299
would be awfully hard now another part

261
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,419
of this is if you want to be really safe

262
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,699
you should tie your ladders together so

263
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:45,000
that you the whole thing is more safe

264
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,379
and that's a that's a good because we

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,778
want to link Theory and measurement

266
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,220
intimately back and forth here's some

267
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,620
examples of that

268
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,379
here's Theory there's measurement let's

269
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,980
take these off of here

270
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,500
um

271
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,339
back and forth back and forth and here

272
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,958
we go in up up up up

273
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,019
out

274
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:10,379
but boy they're far apart and this takes

275
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:13,919
a while to get up there what if we more

276
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:15,778
intimately link them now we have a

277
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,699
faster progress because they're closer

278
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:20,278
together back and forth and then finally

279
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,940
they become one and the same in the same

280
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:26,578
person Theory measurement evaluate that

281
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,140
makes for excellent progress I want to

282
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,639
further emphasize this with some

283
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,278
pictures

284
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,319
here's Theory Albert Einstein all he

285
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,778
ever needed to do research was a box of

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,300
chalk and and it's a wonderful I'd like

287
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,220
to be his department head just Bobby

288
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,139
needing another box of chalk this year

289
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,600
for my research budget

290
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:48,419
here's our Theory we do all kinds of

291
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,800
empirical replicates in the field that

292
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,199
look like this

293
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,199
Theory and measurement Excellence

294
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,079
emerges from continuous coupling we move

295
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,660
these together it's continuously coupled

296
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,000
and we make faster progress we sort out

297
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:06,059
the bad data from the good and we

298
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,419
improve our models by doing this

299
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:12,359
so often in research

300
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:15,179
we get this out of balance and we do a

301
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,180
lot of empirical measurements and we

302
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,500
have very inadequate Theory to explain

303
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:22,620
them

304
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,500
in some Labs the reverse is true

305
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,740
and we have a lot of theory but not very

306
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,559
much data this often happens in climate

307
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,440
science where we have a lot of models we

308
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:37,319
rely heavily on models and

309
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,300
just a little bit of data but in both of

310
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,540
these cases it's out of balance and it

311
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,338
doesn't lead to the fastest progress in

312
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,159
science

313
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,220
now let's switch to a little bit of data

314
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:53,879
that we have here in our lab

315
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:57,540
this is a graph of colors of light at

316
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,980
night and how they affect flowering in

317
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,699
cannabis

318
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,860
so we always say a green light is safe

319
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,139
if you want to work at night always use

320
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,360
green light because that has no effect

321
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,879
on plants

322
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,560
don't use red or blue

323
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:20,278
this is days after start and flower

324
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:23,159
diameter so the steeper the line

325
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,679
the faster the plants flowered so if

326
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,879
they were completely dark

327
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:32,879
they flowered fast if we gave them blue

328
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:34,078
light and I can show that in Blue on

329
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,200
here

330
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,919
they followed equally fast so in this

331
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,079
study blue light was safe no effect look

332
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,139
at red light red lights the opposite of

333
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,159
green flowering was inhibited by red

334
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,060
light

335
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,059
right here

336
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,500
and the flower diameters were smaller

337
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,480
because the plants perceived red light

338
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,559
at night here's the point they'll get

339
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,320
the green green in this study was just

340
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,679
effective as red so

341
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,959
it's not the case that green light is a

342
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,859
safe light plants perceive the green

343
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,500
light

344
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,778
how can that be if plants reflect green

345
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,458
light how can that be so potent that's

346
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,958
why we think it's safe because they just

347
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,239
reflect it

348
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,778
I'm going to put up here a diagram of

349
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,539
how well light penetrates plant leaves

350
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:31,860
green light is reflected but that also

351
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:34,439
means it penetrates deeper into leaves

352
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,240
this is a diagram of the cross section

353
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,060
of a leaf

354
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,399
here's the top of the leaf here's the

355
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:43,379
bottom of the leaf and this distance is

356
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,159
just like one millimeter it's way blown

357
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,799
up

358
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,679
blue and green

359
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,759
are absorbed very quickly in the surface

360
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,278
layer

361
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,319
the green photons hit

362
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,139
and they bounce around and they

363
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,480
penetrate the leaf and this means the

364
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,980
green photons get to the site of

365
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,379
perception

366
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,019
of the light which in this case is the

367
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,820
phytochrome molecule and even though

368
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,198
those photons don't have such a big

369
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,778
effect

370
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,659
they're not zero and they're getting to

371
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:18,958
the site of perception so

372
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,759
this only came from our understanding of

373
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,739
principles we said well this can't be

374
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,500
correct you know just throw the green

375
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,379
light data out no it led to a new

376
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,078
principle and here's the paper that

377
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,078
resulted from it improving the

378
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,659
predictive value of phytochrome

379
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:39,059
photoequilibrium in a consideration of

380
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:42,419
spectral Distortion in a leaf so this

381
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:45,599
data led to this paper

382
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,759
now having said this green light is

383
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,159
still the best light to use because our

384
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,800
eyes are really sensitive to Green Light

385
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,958
it's it's so use green light if you have

386
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,299
to work at night but try to use a

387
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,219
minimal amount of green light it is not

388
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:02,099
completely safe

389
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,939
let's take another example

390
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,679
this is weighing vysimeters

391
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,079
in our

392
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,380
Greenhouse

393
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,240
go back to this these are load cells we

394
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,059
weigh plants we measure transpiration

395
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,338
with this here's a growth chamber and

396
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:22,619
here's this is cotton on these and and

397
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:25,078
corn on these Chambers so we can make

398
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,698
very accurate measurements of how open

399
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,980
the stomates are and how much

400
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,940
transpiration there is let's look at the

401
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,839
data

402
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,519
this was day and night two days

403
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:39,480
transpiration rate which is right here

404
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:43,079
in purple now that is and let's see if I

405
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,500
can show this in purple right here

406
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,699
it's low at night not zero here's zero

407
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,179
right there

408
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,900
high in the day low at night high in the

409
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,140
day

410
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,179
this is our measurements just like that

411
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,759
it's the model conductance that's how

412
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,298
open the stomates are that's shown in

413
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,298
green

414
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:09,000
the stomates open in the day and close

415
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,619
at night but look they're not completely

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,058
closed at night

417
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:19,199
and this number right here is about 0.4

418
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:21,720
open and wide open and the day is about

419
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,240
0.9

420
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,839
so in this data the stomates are about

421
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,400
half as open at night as they are in the

422
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,399
day

423
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,360
the reason this is higher than this is

424
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:40,038
it's very humid at night uh and the and

425
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:42,298
the leaves are cooler so that that

426
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,160
transpiration should be much less

427
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,538
because there's not much of a driving

428
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,720
gradient

429
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:51,140
conductance is the ratio of driving

430
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,880
gradient to transpiration

431
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:57,120
but this is remarkable

432
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,360
now this data was collected some years

433
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:03,058
ago in Cotton but we know this also

434
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,579
happens in cannabis which is a very big

435
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,319
deal because we have a lot of flux of

436
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,558
water at night when the stomachs are

437
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,839
supposed to be closed and they're open

438
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,240
we have to run dehumidifiers or we get

439
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:19,199
plant disease all the textbooks say

440
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,380
stomates close at night and that

441
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,880
sentence in textbooks is just wrong

442
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,179
except

443
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,059
if we give the plants some water stress

444
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,860
a minor water stress

445
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,798
they quickly start to close their

446
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,599
stomachs at night in this same data had

447
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,418
we stressed these plants a little bit

448
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,500
with water now the conductance would be

449
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,059
down here

450
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,140
it looks like this

451
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,839
so

452
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,340
If plants like like many of our cannabis

453
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,959
if they're grown with no water stress

454
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:52,279
they don't close their stomates at night

455
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,279
it's a big big deal

456
00:19:53,038 --> 00:20:00,298
look at this curve this was in electric

457
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:03,779
lights let's get rid of these lines here

458
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:06,779
this is in electric lights and I'm going

459
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:08,220
to have to do that there we go

460
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,440
um

461
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,960
the lights in this

462
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,880
were a square wave

463
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,940
they came on and looked like that this

464
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,380
is not sunlight it's an electric right

465
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,779
all of our principles say that

466
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,660
transpiration rate should follow the

467
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:27,839
light it should go up and high and come

468
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,058
down and instead it's a curve in here

469
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,298
and it happened every day it should have

470
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:35,579
been a square it's a curve in here our

471
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,379
models don't predict that there's some

472
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:41,399
measurements in here didn't match the

473
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:44,360
models when we got this data we very

474
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,360
quickly

475
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,500
went to multiple plants

476
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,860
let's go right here and looked at this

477
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,058
here's a square wave of light all plants

478
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:59,339
do this

479
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,440
in the afternoon it's like they get

480
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:03,839
tired and they and they this is

481
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,820
transpiration rate or this is stomodo

482
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,459
conductance they start to close their

483
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:11,038
stomates in the afternoon and they don't

484
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,980
even open them until about 11 o'clock in

485
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,900
the morning it's a just remarkable that

486
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,819
plants do this and it took controlled

487
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,640
environments to be able to study this

488
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:22,439
this has now look at this here's these

489
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,840
lines are close to zero down here

490
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,759
because the plant's got a little bit of

491
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,038
water stress

492
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,619
um this has big implications for

493
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,558
Designing air conditioning systems and

494
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:37,139
humidity and Disease Control these

495
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,418
stomachs are wide open in the middle one

496
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,280
third of the day but it takes them a few

497
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:43,140
hours to get there and a few and they

498
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,538
close their stomachs for a few hours in

499
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,720
the afternoon

500
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:50,940
now let's go back to another fascinating

501
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,860
thing about this

502
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,820
this is

503
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:58,199
a

504
00:21:55,819 --> 00:22:01,319
well-watered cotton plant

505
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,019
and a two water stress cotton plants the

506
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:07,678
same thing happens in cannabis here's

507
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:09,538
the opening took a long time to open and

508
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,759
then they started to gradually close

509
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,919
there's night right there

510
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,319
but look at these drought stress plants

511
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,960
they also take a while to open they stay

512
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,579
open maybe about half this is a

513
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,860
measurement of how drought stressed they

514
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:26,220
are but look what happens here they go

515
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:29,219
nuts there's noise that is not noise the

516
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,319
whole plant is cycling for water it

517
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,120
opens its snowmates oh we overshot in

518
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:36,298
the closed them and open and closed open

519
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:39,178
and closed we've seen this repeatedly in

520
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:41,400
Plants this is anomalous data this is

521
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,100
the kind of data you go huh that's funny

522
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,460
and then you find out you can repeat it

523
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:50,219
this has big implications for design of

524
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,620
controlled environments where we spend a

525
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,319
lot of money taking the humidity out of

526
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:59,219
the air

527
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:02,519
um let's get rid of those these

528
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:07,019
and we'll do those lines are off

529
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:09,839
now let's move to another huge area for

530
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:12,839
us here in the crop physiology lab and

531
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:15,000
my colleagues this is far red photons

532
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,839
you can just barely see far red right

533
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
here

534
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,558
we call these the Forgotten photons

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,159
because they're on the edge of our

536
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:25,379
vision we can barely see them

537
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,260
we've done a lot of work with far red

538
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,559
photons and their photosynthetic value

539
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:33,599
this work was done with my long-term

540
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,178
colleague Mark Van ersol at the

541
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:40,199
University of Georgia he was here last

542
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:43,320
summer with us we recorded videos with

543
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,779
us he's just been a joy to work with

544
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:49,678
he's now got an endowed chair position

545
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:52,379
at the University of Georgia and Chu

546
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,860
young Jen who is a very talented

547
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,740
scientist she got her PhD with Mark then

548
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:00,899
she came to Utah to work with me for a

549
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:05,339
postdoc she is now an assistant

550
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:09,419
professor at Texas A M University

551
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:13,740
together the three of us have published

552
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:16,080
six six seven papers on this and I want

553
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,940
to review this evidence because it has

554
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,240
the potential to be

555
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,900
a profound implications for all of plant

556
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,900
biology

557
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:29,519
here's lettuce

558
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,860
no far red and 10 percent of the photons

559
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,960
is far red now you don't have to be a

560
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:36,418
rocket scientist to see those far red

561
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,860
photons they're doing amazing things to

562
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,380
this plant

563
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,839
some of this is due to what we call the

564
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,700
shade avoidance response they think

565
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,500
they're in shade so they just spread out

566
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,140
they spread their leaves bigger that's

567
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,779
not surprising we've known that forever

568
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,120
but with careful measurements of

569
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:57,240
photosynthesis we have shown that some

570
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,339
of this profound effect is also due to

571
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,099
far red photons

572
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:05,099
that is a big deal because for years and

573
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:08,519
years we've said far red photons do not

574
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:12,719
cause photosynthesis

575
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:15,418
so it's an amazing claim to say they do

576
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,000
when we have amazing claims

577
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,538
we should always fall back on this

578
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
mantra

579
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:25,740
extraordinary claims require

580
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,579
extraordinary proof now this was

581
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,740
popularized by Carl Sagan and Cosmos but

582
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:34,740
this is an old saying

583
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,599
so now what I want to do is show you the

584
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,140
extraordinary proof

585
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:42,959
for far red and photosynthesis

586
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:47,159
this is gonna it's a very concise

587
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:50,278
summary but this started in 2017 with

588
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,380
Journal of plant physiology Mark and Shu

589
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:54,960
young in Georgia studied the light

590
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,900
reactions of photosynthesis and very

591
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,538
clearly showed these far red photons had

592
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,298
a beneficial effect they followed it up

593
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:05,879
with laser diodes a year later published

594
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:08,879
another paper physiologic a plantarum

595
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:14,159
which showing that the wavelengths of

596
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:17,460
far red up to about 730 nanometers were

597
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,200
clearly helpful in the light reactions

598
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,079
then

599
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,500
after that Shu young came here to our

600
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:28,980
lab in Utah where we have a whole series

601
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,200
of whole plant gas exchange Chambers so

602
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,880
we can measure photosynthesis on whole

603
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,159
canopies

604
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,679
Shu young and I published a paper in

605
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,840
2020 in plant cell and environment one

606
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,179
of our top journals

607
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,759
far red photons have equivalent

608
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:49,320
efficiency to traditional photosynthetic

609
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:51,778
photons implications for redefining par

610
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,038
par is photosynthetically active

611
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,798
radiation

612
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:59,700
we kept working on this in longer term

613
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:01,859
whole plan studies published a paper on

614
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,220
Far red photons in Frontiers in plant

615
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:08,099
science so it more accumulating evidence

616
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,319
more papers and now our colleagues are

617
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:12,899
getting into this and there's other

618
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,079
papers from other Laboratories showing

619
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,480
far red photons have photosynthetic

620
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:21,418
value note that all these papers are

621
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,360
pretty recent papers

622
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,220
now there's one thing that's critical

623
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,278
here

624
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,740
and that's the mechanism for this

625
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:35,579
here's my diagram of how the light

626
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:38,759
reactions of photosynthesis work

627
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:41,759
the Stark Einstein loss is one Photon

628
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,700
excites one electron

629
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:48,058
this is how solar panels work this is

630
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,960
how photosynthesis work a photon comes

631
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:51,960
in

632
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,778
excites this guy this electron gets

633
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,778
excited and then it's passed down this

634
00:27:54,778 --> 00:28:01,140
Mill this turns it makes ATP makes

635
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:03,839
energy another Photon hits this guy boom

636
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,759
and other electrons excited so it's a

637
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:09,720
two-stage process

638
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,940
for a photo system two comes first in

639
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,519
photosystem one comes second this is

640
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,220
because we discovered this first and

641
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,859
then we later found out there's two

642
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,960
um water gets split right here to oxygen

643
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:25,139
but here's the key we have known for a

644
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:29,460
long time that far red photons excite

645
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,820
this photoreceptor in photosystem one

646
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,278
and that is called the Emerson

647
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:38,460
enhancement effect it's been known for

648
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:41,519
50 years but it's been little studied

649
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,940
until now when we got far red LEDs we

650
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,980
can do more rigorous studies of this

651
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,220
um you can pause this and look at this

652
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,620
diagram but this is the this is electron

653
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,798
transport in photosynthesis but

654
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:58,139
simplified to show electrons getting

655
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:01,500
excited it takes four elect four four

656
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,059
photons here and four photons here

657
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,619
either

658
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:09,839
classic or far red and

659
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:12,959
it takes eight photons to get through

660
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,459
the whole thing and fix CO2

661
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,940
so

662
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,819
we have extended this now

663
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,700
to plants in sunlight

664
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:26,819
not just electric light sunlight and

665
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,679
very recently July 2022 we published a

666
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:29,700
paper

667
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,340
photosynthesis in Sun and shade

668
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:36,720
surprising importance of far red this

669
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:39,000
extends the work to sunlight and this is

670
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,278
a new phytologist is one of our top

671
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,140
journals

672
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:45,480
we

673
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,759
hope that this will help people

674
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,278
understand the value of far red light

675
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:53,398
which is a very big deal in the world of

676
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:55,859
cannabis because far red photons are

677
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:57,658
very efficient they're long wavelength

678
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:59,699
and they're very photosynthetically

679
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:03,260
efficient

680
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,700
here's the classic McCree curve for

681
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:08,519
photosynthetic efficiency

682
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,038
it the our definitions it cuts it off

683
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,839
here these photons are not very many and

684
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,898
this curve is pretty accurate they drop

685
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:19,259
pretty fast over here we got 700 there's

686
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:22,379
the classic definition now we add this

687
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:25,980
recent work this curve has a bulge over

688
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,580
here so it looks like this the and it

689
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,220
goes to 750. the old definition is

690
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,778
called par

691
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,819
photosynthetically active radiation the

692
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:40,640
new definition is called epar extended

693
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:44,778
photosynthetically active radiation

694
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,580
apogee makes a sensor to measure epar

695
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:52,159
and it's a better predictor of

696
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:52,158
photosynthesis than the old par

697
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:59,640
so on a close here this is a diagram

698
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:03,298
done by a Utah artist James Christensen

699
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:06,440
and I just love it this is what we do in

700
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:09,898
science to get serendipitous discoveries

701
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:13,620
we take our

702
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:15,418
equipment out and sometimes their Labs

703
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,359
look like a bad day in a Spaghetti

704
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:20,580
Factory around here we take it out for a

705
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:21,898
drive and test it and see what happens

706
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,178
and if you want to know how to get

707
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:26,819
Serendipity and science

708
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:30,298
build equipment homemade doesn't cost

709
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:32,398
much and take it out for a drive and see

710
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,918
what happens and be prepared for

711
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,500
anomalous findings

712
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,320
thanks for listening I hope this

713
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,460
inspires you to go on and make a lot of

714
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,460
measurements in science
