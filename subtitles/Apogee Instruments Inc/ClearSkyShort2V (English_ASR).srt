1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,960
is your par meter accurate I have no

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,559
idea but I do know of a tool that can

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,240
help you decide whether or not your

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,800
meter is starting to drift the tool you

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,559
can use is called the clear sky

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,480
calculator and it can be found at Clear

7
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,359
Sky calculator.com can be used to

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,199
determine the accuracy of any brand of

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,640
parmeter first take the measurement with

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,320
your meter as close to solar noon with

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,880
non-polluted Skies minimal humidity and

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,599
the sensor perfectly level second enter

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,559
that information into the field and

14
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,480
voila it will compare your measurement

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,039
to what the ideal measurement should be

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,640
thereby giving you a baseline to

17
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,119
reference from and determine the

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,039
accuracy of your par meter keep in mind

19
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,280
it is a mathematical model so if you

20
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,558
have less than perfect conditions when

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
you take your measurement you'll have

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,238
less than perfect results but it should

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,960
help you notice any serious accuracy

24
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,159
problems before weeks or months worth of

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,600
data are lost if your AP meter is more

26
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,198
than 10% off a button will appear

27
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,520
inviting you to take advantage of the

28
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,198
recalibration services provided by apog

32
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,920
the question
