Hello, my name is Schuyler Smith, and I do technical sales support here at Apogee Instruments.

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:10,878
And today we’re going to talk about how to connect the SP-214-SS pyranometer to the SMA cluster controller,

3
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:15,192
a very popular controller among commercial solar applications.

4
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:20,463
The SP-214-SS is our 4 to 20 mA pyranometer output.

5
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:26,896
And so, the first thing to note in this video, is that for serial numbers 9898 or higher—

6
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:31,303
and you can determine that by looking at the white label next to your pyranometer.

7
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:40,337
If your sensor looks like this, where it has the old tailboard like this, and its serial number is below 9898,

8
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:46,280
that is on a different video and you can find that on our website www.apogeeinstruments.com.

9
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:57,674
So the first thing to note when you’re getting ready to wire up the sensor is the distance from your power supply right here to your X8 terminals over here.

10
00:00:57,673 --> 00:01:05,938
And so if, in our case, we needed to take off some additional of the shield here of the outer jacket.

11
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,938
And so we went ahead and took off about 8 more inches because it comes with 8 inches already.

12
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:19,715
So once we did that, then we went ahead and wired up our red and our black, right here, to our screw-in terminals.

13
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:22,573
Red into positive. Black into negative.

14
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:26,921
Then the next thing we did is we had to take a jumper wire,

15
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:35,424
and we went from the negative of the power supply over here to A3 on the X8 terminal.

16
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:42,200
And then we take our white signal output and we run that into the A2 terminal.

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,900
And then we took a shield and run that into A4.

18
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,765
And that’s how you wire it up!

19
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:58,647
To check and verify that that’s wired up correctly, you can push down on the controller until you see analog current input.

20
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:06,318
In our example, you can see it says 4.01 mA, which with our studio lights is what we would expect in here.

21
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:12,979
Then if we push down two more times, we see that it says Insolation at 1 W per m².

22
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,635
So the last thing you need to do is you do need to set up that Insolation curve.

23
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:22,300
And you do that through the user interface where you connect this to your computer.

24
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,548
And once you’re in that user interface, then you go to the Meteorology section,

25
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:32,165
and then you click on environmental, and then you click on irradiance sensor.

26
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:37,012
And you change the range to be from 0 to 2000 W per m².

27
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:43,049
And then again it’s a 4 to 20 mA sensor and so you change that there as well.

28
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:48,540
That concludes how to wire up the SP-214 to the SMA cluster controller.

29
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:56,252
Be sure to watch our other video on the PV-100, which explains how to connect the ambient air temperature sensor,

30
00:02:56,252 --> 00:03:00,913
as well as the back of panel temperature sensor, to the SMA cluster controller.

31
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,358
Thanks for watching!

00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:02,859
