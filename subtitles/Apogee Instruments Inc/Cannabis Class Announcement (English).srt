00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,120
I'm Bruce Bugbee, President of Apogee Instruments  and also Professor of Crop Physiology at Utah  

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,800
State University. And I'm recording this video  today, here in the Apogee recording studio, to  

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:23,520
make an exciting announcement. We are now teaching  a class in the science and technology of cannabis  

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,320
cultivation. This is medical cannabis  cultivation. This class is the result  

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,679
of years of our research in my laboratory at Utah  State University with my graduate students. And  

6
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,280
also I'm joined in teaching this class by  a couple of colleagues. I want to give you  

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,480
a quick overview of the class in this video, and  then the link so you can register for the class.  

8
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:59,199
Let's take the words in the title for starters.  "The science." This is based on our research and  

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,520
university research of our colleagues on  cannabis. It's also based on our experience  

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,799
applying the principles in the field. This is  a big greenhouse of cannabis with one of our  

11
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:20,159
collaborating growers that's working with us  on this. The "technology" means applying the  

12
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,719
science. It means the principles that we learn.  How do we apply them? What technologies do we use  

13
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:33,120
to optimize cannabis cultivation? That makes this  class unique. It's not just a principles class  

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,719
that we might teach graduate students at the  university. It's an applied class where we  

15
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,200
explain how to apply the principles. So it's that  combination that makes this class truly unique.  

16
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,679
It's in medical cannabis. We're talking about  cannabinoids and terpenes in this class.  

17
00:01:52,959 --> 00:02:00,000
Both for high THC cannabis and for low  THC cannabis. Those two types of cannabis  

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,200
are only separated by a couple of genes. And what  that means is when you learn something in low THC  

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,080
cannabis, it applies to high THC cannabis.  Back and forth. This is a unique class,  

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,680
and it's all recorded online. It is presentations,  like this one. We annotate the screen. We work  

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,960
things out. But we're also going to take  you to the greenhouse and to the laboratory  

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:37,360
to show you the work in progress with our team of  graduate students doing this work. Let's take a  

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:46,080
look at what we're talking about. This is what we  use often: the nine cardinal parameters of plant  

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,080
growth. Four are in the root zone. Five are in the  shoot zone. I've shown this slide in other videos,  

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,040
and it must be effective because other people  use this slide to explain things as well.  

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,040
These parameters interact with each other  in really fascinating ways. We'll talk  

27
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,679
about them individually, and we'll talk about  the interactions. Let me show you the modules  

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,960
right here. And we'll come back to this. There  are seven modules. You can register for each one  

29
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,719
independently. Or if you sign up for all of  them, you get a bulk discount on the whole class.  

30
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:34,400
The pricing is designed to match what a two credit  class would be at the university. But this is open  

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,439
to the public. You do not have to be a university  accepted student to apply for this. Anyone can  

32
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:50,639
pay the tuition and take the class. We're  starting with optimizing the root zone. And  

33
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,359
look at the interactions we get here: temperature,  water, oxygen, nutrients. Nutrients means both  

34
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,039
nutrition - the principles, what things do plants  need and in what ratio - and it also means the  

35
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:11,280
fertilizer And that's the practices. Exactly  what do we apply in different kinds of media.  

36
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,439
This includes the options for media down here.  But now let's just look at the interactions  

37
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,319
right out of the gate. Temperature  interacts with oxygen. As temperature  

38
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,800
goes up, oxygen solubility goes down. What does  that do to cannabis? We know from our research  

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,360
cannabis is uniquely sensitive to low oxygen in  the root zone. That's a finding that we've learned  

40
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,480
just in the last year with research. Water  interacts with oxygen. The water goes up,  

41
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,720
the oxygen goes down. Back and forth. How do we  co-optimize all of these things? We get to the  

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,840
shoot zone. Temperature and humidity interact.  That's a discipline called psychometrics, and  

43
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,040
at the end of this class you will know the  difference between relative humidity and absolute  

44
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,160
humidity. And you'll know how those two parameters  interact to drive transpiration in the plant.  

45
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:16,800
Advantages of optimal CO2. And then finally...  KABOOM! Light! That's huge! It drives the rates of  

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
all of these other things. We drive the light,  we double the growth. We drive the water,  

47
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,680
everything follows that. And guess what? The  third module is just about optimizing lighting.  

48
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,319
LED lighting. HPS lighting. We talk about all  the kinds of lighting. We've done a lot of  

49
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:41,519
research on that. We do not do plant  breeding. But we work closely with  

50
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,919
plant breeders to test their genetics. So we'll  talk about the botany and the genetic diversity  

51
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:56,240
and the emerging opportunities in breeding of  cannabis. Propagation. We own all female plants.  

52
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,960
We do cuttings. We can do feminized seed. How do  you do that? What are the technologies for that?  

53
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,680
Finding clothes with harvesting, drying,  curing. How do we preserve everything and  

54
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:19,840
optimally cure the plant? This is the course.  The website for this is cannabis.usu.edu.  

55
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,120
So at that website, there's more detail  and also a link to register for the class.  

56
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:36,480
This class has the number of lectures that about  a three credit university level class would have,  

57
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,640
but we've priced it modestly equivalent  to about a two credit university class.  

58
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:52,879
All of the tuition money that you pay for this  class goes to support graduate education in our  

59
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,399
laboratory at USU. It doesn't go to my salary.  It doesn't go to infrastructure. It goes to  

60
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,879
support additional research by graduate  students. We're excited to teach this.  

61
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:15,839
Go to the link, and get more detail. And  we look forward to having you in the class!
