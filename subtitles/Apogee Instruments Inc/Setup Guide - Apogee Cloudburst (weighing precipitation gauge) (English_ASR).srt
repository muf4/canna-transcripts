00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,340
this is the quick start guide for the

00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:12,240
ape Cloud

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,560
burst today we're going to show you how

5
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,079
to set up the cloud burst the first

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,640
thing is choosing a location make sure

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,239
when you choose a location that free

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,399
from obstructions that might prevent

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,000
precipitation from coming into the gauge

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,159
things like trees or buildings this

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
location is a great location now that

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,558
You' decided where to put your gauge you

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,520
need to put it in the ground when you're

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,280
setting your post make sure that you use

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,239
concrete so that during the operation of

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,359
the precipitation gauge it won't shift

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,839
or move or go out of level the cloud

18
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:46,238
burst has two mounting options either a

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,920
4in diameter Pole or a 6x6 in wooden

20
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,878
post if you're going to mount using

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,640
wooden post you can directly screw the

22
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:53,960
base plate into the top of the post

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,719
using lag screws make sure that as you

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,640
set the plate that you level it using

25
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,280
the Bubble Level on the base

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,679
plate if you're going to use a 4-in pole

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,799
make sure that you get the adapter the

28
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,640
adapter will allow the base plate to fit

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,159
to a 4in pipe I'm going to show you how

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,200
you set it up using the 4-in pipe with

31
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,320
the adapter screwed into the base plate

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,640
set the base plate on top of the

33
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,199
pipe Orient it so that the Bubble Level

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,280
is pointing

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,159
North and with it set level you use the

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,118
screws to secure it in place with the

37
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,159
base plate leveled and the bubble

38
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,920
pointing North is if you're in the

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,640
Northern Hemisphere or South if you're

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
in the southern hemisphere you're now

41
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,359
ready to add the load cell on the load

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,680
cell find where the cable is coming out

43
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,319
of the load cell and you want that to

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,640
align with the Bubble Level pointing

45
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,599
North if you're in the northern

46
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,560
hemisphere the holes on the bottom of

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,798
the plate should align

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,280
perfectly with the load cell centered

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,039
and in place you're ready to add the

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,840
cable run the cable through the access

51
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,399
port

52
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,399
up screw in the cord

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,360
grip and run the cable around to the

54
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,360
load cell connector and screw it

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,919
in make sure the cable doesn't come in

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,800
contact with the outside housing secure

57
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,639
the cord grip so the cord doesn't move

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,640
now you're ready to add the

59
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,279
sstn place a sistern on top of the load

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,760
cell it should Center and line up with

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,759
the indentation on the bottom of the

62
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,759
sstn

63
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,680
now you're ready to add fluid it's a

64
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,079
little bit of a process so we're going

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,920
to show you how to do that in the studio

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,239
when recharging your precipitation gauge

67
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,639
we recommend that you do it sometime

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,640
usually in September October or late

69
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,639
fall that way the minimal amount of

70
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,639
antifreeze is required for the winter we

71
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,199
recommend using an antifreeze that has a

72
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,878
ratio of 50/50 propylene glycol and

73
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,238
ethanol something like the Campbell

74
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,399
scientific

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,840
cs75 we recommend using this kind of

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,039
antifreeze because it's non-toxic and

77
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,120
has a lower impact on on the environment

78
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,840
when disposing of the antifreeze mixture

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,719
make sure you do so in accordance to

80
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,878
local state and federal guidelines now

81
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,560
for the calculations the purpose of this

82
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,878
equation is to determine the minimal

83
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,680
amount of anif freeze that is required

84
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,798
to go in the sstn for your situation

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,080
first you need to determine what is the

86
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,360
coldest temperature that you expect your

87
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,959
gauge to be in in Northern Utah the

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,159
coldest temperature that we could expect

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,840
would be- 25° C we can also determine

90
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,759
that between September and January when

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,878
we expect our coldest temperature we'll

92
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,158
receive somewhere between 7 to 8 in of

93
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:40,239
precipitation so we go to our chart we

94
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:43,079
take our minus 25° C and we see that

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,319
it's a one part antifreeze to 1.5 Parts

96
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,920
precipitation to determine how much

97
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,079
anifree we need to put inside the sstn

98
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,238
we're going to use the following

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,200
equation for National Weather Service

100
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,719
Inlet it's going to be this equation so

101
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,719
we're going to take

102
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,920
0528908075 Ed precipitation then we're

103
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,680
going to divide that by the parts per

104
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:10,318
water ratio so we take

105
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,599
42312 divide that by 1.5 so we can see

106
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,639
that we're going to need about 2.8 in of

107
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,959
antifreeze in our bucket in order to

108
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,319
prevent freezing at the coldest point

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
next year keep in mind you can always

110
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,719
add more antifreeze if you need more

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,319
protection it just costs more money this

112
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,440
just gives you the minimal amount you'll

113
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,918
need to avoid freezing the last thing

114
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,199
you need to do is add 400 milliliters of

115
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,319
mineral oil on top this will give you a

116
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,120
quar inch layer of mineral oil that will

117
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,639
prevent evaporation from occurring now

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,879
that you have your sistern full of

119
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,560
antifreeze and mineral oil you're ready

120
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,560
to finish the install now the sister's

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,199
full ready to go it's time to remove the

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,439
clips from the load

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,960
cell squeeze the

124
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,120
ends and pull them off if you're going

125
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,120
to move or transport the load cell it's

126
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,560
a good idea to hold on to these now

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,560
you're ready to add the outside

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
housing

129
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,560
the outside housing will

130
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,280
slide around the outside over the top

131
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,759
make sure you align the inlet with a

132
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,000
sstn on the

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,879
inside use the clips to secure it in

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,199
place hook up the cable to a data loger

135
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,360
and you're ready for another years's

136
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,360
worth of precipitation

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
recording we recommend servicing your

138
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,280
gauge in the fall by servicing the gauge

139
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,199
in the fall you minimize the amount of

140
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,679
antifreeze that is required to prevent

141
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,400
freezing to service the cloud burst

142
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,400
remove the outside

143
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,319
housing with the housing removed look

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,360
around and make sure that everything is

145
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,199
in working order the sistern is probably

146
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,038
to be quite full there's two handles on

147
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,240
the side of sister to help you lift it

148
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:51,879
off so another great option is to use a

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,840
siphon put the siphon in the sistern and

150
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,079
the few squeezes it'll begin to

151
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,000
automatically drain fill up the sstn

152
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:03,279
with fluid antifreeze and then the oil

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,600
on top now the sn's full ready to go put

154
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,599
the outside housing back

155
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,000
on with the outside housing back on

156
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,000
you're ready for another Year's worth

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,199
precipitation monitoring if you have any

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,800
questions feel free to leave them in the

159
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,370
comment section below thank you so very

160
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:23,490
much for watching and have a great
