1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,599
i'm bruce bugbee president of apogee

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,839
instruments and in the next few minutes

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,239
i want to show you about

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,320
the latest product that we have just

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,599
released for

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
measuring

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,519
daily light integral this is it right

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,199
here tiny

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,000
very rugged

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,880
it has a microprocessor in it and

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,879
records so it measures the integral of

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,239
light through the day

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,879
and records it for 99 days really easy

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,039
to use you can download the data

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,160
we're excited about this project

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,839
this product this meter is one that i

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,479
have had running

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
in my conservatory at our house my wife

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,919
and i remodeled we built a conservatory

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,480
for all my exotic plants and oh god it's

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,198
been wonderful i just every day i go out

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,599
and check the data on this thing

23
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,878
so let's let me show you

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,320
what we have

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,599
so this is the meter we call it a dli

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,478
meter

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,040
daily light integral and i think most

28
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,478
people let me show you what what we mean

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,560
when we say that

30
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,879
if we make a little graph

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,280
up here let me get some

32
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,319
pen on here i'm going to show this in

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,879
yellow

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,639
if we make a little graph

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:25,039
and we do dawn to dusk

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,519
dusk

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
and if it's a sunny day

38
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,640
it looks like this

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,000
nice smooth curve on a sunny day

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,319
what determines plant growth is not the

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,799
light intensity to any given moment it's

42
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,199
the integral this whole thing in here

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,360
all this area under here

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,159
and to do that you need a microprocessor

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,560
now lots of apogee meters have that but

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,439
they're not as small and compact as

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,879
rugged as this new meter shown here

48
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,639
really big

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,599
and i'll walk you through this in just a

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320
minute

51
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,438
what if it's a cloudy day that's that's

52
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,798
attempt showing a cloudy day

53
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,519
in green

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,599
now we get clouds like this

55
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,120
it still adds that all up day after day

56
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,159
gives you a different number for each

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,959
day that's the concept of daily light

58
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,159
integral and why this is so critical to

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
use

60
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,919
meters historically haven't had this

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,680
because you need a microprocessor that

62
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,839
can do integrals inside the meter

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,239
apogee's had this before but only in

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,280
more expensive meters this is lower cost

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,439
so let's take a look at this meter and

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,640
and i'll show you what it gives you

67
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,639
this first number right here and big let

68
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,159
me put this back to

69
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,119
um

70
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,400
let's let's go with

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
um

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,200
blue right here

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,239
this is dli daily light integral the

74
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,000
units for this are moles

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
of photons

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,239
per meter squared

77
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
per day

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,200
now remember

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,840
a standard meter gives you

80
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,079
micro moles

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,840
per meter squared

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
per

83
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,719
second

84
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,719
and this is good but you add all those

85
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,878
seconds up in a day

86
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,799
and you add all these micros up and you

87
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,439
get moles

88
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:34,159
and on a typical day

89
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:37,759
inside a greenhouse you might get 18.5

90
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:41,199
moles per meter squared per day of light

91
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,079
this is what determines plant growth

92
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,158
and

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,760
i'll show you some charts about how to

94
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,840
interpret that number it ranges in the

95
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,439
winter outside

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
this dli

97
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,519
might let's put this in an even

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,759
different color right here

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,799
the winter now i'm recording this in

100
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,438
winter

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
winter

102
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,840
we might get

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,840
eight

104
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,799
moles

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,799
per meter squared per day pretty low

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,799
summer

107
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,599
we get

108
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,599
60.

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,079
huge difference

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,759
inside the greenhouse

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,639
we might get

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
four

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,519
in the winter and 30 in the summer

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
because a typical greenhouse blocks half

115
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,478
the light

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,960
so that's why you need this for

117
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,199
inside a greenhouse it's also valuable

118
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,079
for indoor agriculture

119
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,120
because it it uses as you can use it as

120
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,279
an immediate meter but also even making

121
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,519
sure you got the right daily light

122
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,559
integral in your greenhouse even though

123
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,639
the lights are on all the time

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
so there's the first number

125
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,680
and i'll show you in a minute how it

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680
records that

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
in addition to this

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,840
it's also got timers in it and it gives

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,038
you photo period under here

130
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,359
in hours

131
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,000
to a tenth of an hour

132
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
this helps you understand flowering in

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
crops

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,478
i'm not going to go into short day and

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
long day plants in this video but

136
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,159
floater period is a big deal

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,560
you want to know

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,039
if if you have light pollution you want

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,120
to know how long your photo period was

140
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,918
especially for medical hemp growers this

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,519
is a very critical number to know photo

142
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,319
period

143
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,038
this is because it records it also shows

144
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,000
you days ago right here

145
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,959
so

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
there's the one of the screens in this

147
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,399
and we'll walk through some of these

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,360
screens in just a minute

149
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,000
this shows you the recorded data

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,840
but what if we take this

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,079
and we want to know what the light is

152
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,319
right now you know i can turn it on

153
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,478
right here one click of the button show

154
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,639
what the light is in the studio it's

155
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,879
plenty bright to shoot this video but

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,120
look we're only getting four

157
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,000
micro moles per meter squared per second

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,639
in here not enough to grow plants so

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
what's the next screen look like boom

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,639
this is instantaneous

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
i'm going to put inst for here and this

162
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
is dli

163
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,280
over here

164
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,400
you turn it on

165
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,399
there's there's our number 164.6

166
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,240
micro moles per meter squared per second

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,360
so this is a rugged portable

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,000
accurate

169
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,240
meter for measuring what we call ppfd

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,800
at all times and then it has this

171
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,560
additional functionality to record it

172
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
for daily like integral

173
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,440
notice in this screen

174
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,560
these these two meters are example of

175
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,519
the screen

176
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,680
notice one other thing this one's blue

177
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,639
this one's gray

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,478
this measures this is our classic high

179
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,000
end meter for doing par

180
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,439
photosynthetically active radiation 400

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,879
to 700

182
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,680
this meter

183
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,079
is calibrated for sunlight

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
so it's a way that we can offer you a

185
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,879
lower cost meter

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,199
that's perfectly accurate in sunlight

187
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
and then you can do calibrations of this

188
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,598
to get other things

189
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,079
this is the same detector as the apogee

190
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,478
original quantum sensor

191
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,680
we just say it's calibrated for sunlight

192
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,519
right here

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,038
this is the meter that has a square wave

194
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,359
a step up

195
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:42,639
to give you 400 to 700 nanometers

196
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,199
now there's one more option on here

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,639
if you've listened to other videos you

198
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,919
know that

199
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,720
we do

200
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,159
e

201
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
par

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,400
because of our research on

203
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,439
photosynthesis we do extended range

204
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,719
power

205
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,719
and we also call this eppf

206
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:07,519
we also have a version of this meter

207
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,199
that does epar and eppfd

208
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,680
400

209
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,400
to 750.

210
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,199
this is the emerging new standard for

211
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,439
this and for the best accuracy

212
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
this is the meter that

213
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,079
gives you the extended range

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,840
this one is 400

215
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,878
to

216
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,598
this is also 400 to 700

217
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
but

218
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,759
calibrated for sunlight so there's the

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,679
lineup there's the three optional meters

220
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,278
this this you probably can't see these

221
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,519
tiny numbers

222
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,799
this is the dli

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,799
400

224
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,199
and like things go when the number gets

225
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:52,079
higher it gets more sophisticated this

226
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,759
one is the 500 and this one is model 600

227
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,759
and if you had a microscope you could

228
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,799
see the model number right there in

229
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,559
these uh

230
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,519
meters and it

231
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,518
tells you what it does

232
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,759
let's take a look

233
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
and at one of these and how it works in

234
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,200
the screens and i think i can just

235
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
demonstrate this to you

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,360
chris wants to try and zoom in on this

237
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,360
thing let's see if we can show this

238
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,600
little tiny screen

239
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,560
as big as possible for our

240
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,278
users we get that oh beautiful beautiful

241
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,439
all right turn it on

242
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,958
all you do is push the button it's on

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,839
it's giving you

244
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:34,000
ppfd just like any other meter

245
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,000
now we push the button again

246
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,879
and it's showing days ago zero

247
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,480
what that means is the total so far

248
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,360
today

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,200
so it resets it automatically as a timer

250
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,120
resets at night

251
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,440
so it gives you the total so far today

252
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,839
and i just turned this one on so it only

253
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,640
shows a short photo period

254
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:01,120
if i push the button again or when i do

255
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,879
it goes to one day ago

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,759
and

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,759
that well this this one that is just

258
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,559
here let's look at this one

259
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,200
here

260
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,679
here's the one in my conservatory the

261
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,680
one they've actually been running

262
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,958
current dli

263
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,719
so far today now let me push it again

264
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,359
one day ago

265
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,278
here in logan utah in my conservatory i

266
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,919
got 9.1

267
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,320
moles a day of photons

268
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,759
now this is pretty good for winter i

269
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
have a little bit of supplemental

270
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,480
lighting in there it integrated the

271
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,600
whole thing

272
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,159
the photo period was 14.1

273
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
hours because these supplemental lights

274
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,439
ran

275
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,440
longer now let's push it again

276
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,079
there's two days ago

277
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,399
what happened keep going we got 14.4

278
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:55,599
hours 11.2 that was a nice sunny day

279
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,278
now 9.1 three days ago let me find a

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,519
cloudy day there we go

281
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,919
five days ago it was cloudy i only got

282
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,278
4.1 moles a day

283
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,039
because of the clouds in the

284
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:09,200
conservatory keep going go go go go 99

285
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,360
days of storage

286
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
so

287
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
do you need to sit there with a pencil

288
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,879
sure you can do that but

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,240
there's more

290
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,240
if you take this meter

291
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,600
the bottom has two screws

292
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,519
you can take these out

293
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
we send you a little tiny screwdriver

294
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,440
for this

295
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,639
now this is a very well sealed meter

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,760
this is an ip65 meter it's exceptionally

297
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,360
rugged

298
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,838
users tell us they're running this

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,680
underwater in their salt water aquariums

300
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,000
the reason it all over the place you can

301
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,159
spray it with hoses it's amazing so it

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,399
has really good seals

303
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,000
so you take this little post that's

304
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,799
supplied

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,639
you can screw it in like this

306
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,399
and pull the bottom out

307
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,240
now there's the batteries there's the

308
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
bottom but

309
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
right here

310
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,279
chris when we zoom in on this little

311
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
thing i think i got a slide of this too

312
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,078
but we'll show it live

313
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,519
there's a little usbc port and we give

314
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,359
you a cable

315
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,320
plug that in

316
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
boom

317
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,320
download the data to your computer

318
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,560
so you can download the past 99 days of

319
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,079
data with this cable as soon as you take

320
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,638
the bottom off

321
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,439
then when you've got it all downloaded

322
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,000
pop the bottom back in and you're and

323
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,800
you're good to go with the

324
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,039
screwdrivers now

325
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,039
let me

326
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,838
show you what else you can do with this

327
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,799
little cable

328
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,120
this is made to help mount it notice

329
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,439
at home

330
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,839
i have a little tiny tripod and i mount

331
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,800
it i can move it around nice

332
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,000
but it also comes with a little steak

333
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,159
so if you have

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,159
containers

335
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,958
just put her in a container there you go

336
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,399
you're good to go it's mounted

337
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,719
so

338
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,440
a lot of mounting options

339
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,120
let's let's go back to these slides now

340
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,519
and go into some more detail here

341
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,078
we have been testing this thing in many

342
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,560
greenhouses in many places for

343
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,559
both for ruggedness for examples of

344
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,439
mounting and that's what we want to show

345
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,399
you

346
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,600
here here's a nice poinsettia crop

347
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,240
on the top of a tripod in a growers

348
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,360
greenhouse

349
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,440
some lettuce on a tripod right here

350
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,600
another example of mounting here it's on

351
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,600
the end of a cross arm there's lots of

352
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,639
ways to mount this here's that little

353
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
stake in a pod and here it is on one of

354
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
our

355
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,959
platforms

356
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,440
this picture shows you a bunch of things

357
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,799
it's rugged we've done a lot of a lot of

358
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
testing on it

359
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:57,039
and a lot of mounting options

360
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,320
we have yet to have any failures and

361
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,159
we've been like i say it's

362
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,399
ip65 um

363
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,759
let me review that for a second let's

364
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,519
let's go

365
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,838
back to this slide

366
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,600
so i got room to write

367
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,160
and

368
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,159
i'm going to

369
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,839
attempt to

370
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,440
now i've just put it up here

371
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,440
i

372
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,679
p

373
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,919
65

374
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:34,078
is a rating of how resistant it is to

375
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,679
dust and water

376
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,719
we used to think ip50 was good and we

377
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,559
get better seals when we get to ip55

378
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,399
this is 65. this one stands for dust

379
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,879
any kind of dirt getting into it won't

380
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
get into it it's very sealed five stands

381
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,639
for water and

382
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,639
so it's two digits that um

383
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,639
the higher you go the better sealed

384
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,278
that's exceptionally well sealed all

385
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,799
right now let's get back to this

386
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,439
here it is here's it is with some

387
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,198
medical hemp in a greenhouse this has

388
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,760
been really helpful to

389
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,078
medical hemp growers let's take a close

390
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,759
look at the screen just to review

391
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,559
instantaneous

392
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,360
the screen goes up it measures

393
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,518
high numbers in micro moles again

394
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
micro moles per meter square per second

395
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,240
real simple that's just the standard

396
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,040
mode

397
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,198
if you go to the screen

398
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:32,399
that recording screen

399
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:35,120
gives you the dli in moles

400
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,000
photo period in hours to a tenth of an

401
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,600
hour and then how many days ago

402
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
you every time you push the button you

403
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,480
go back one day at the end of that you

404
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,399
just put a long push and it resets right

405
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
to zero

406
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,600
this meter once you put the batteries in

407
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,920
the meter turns on

408
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,879
and it automatically runs in the

409
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,838
background the meter is always on

410
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,799
the screen will go blank to save battery

411
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,759
power but it's always running that's a

412
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,958
unique feature of this batteries last

413
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,600
six months the two triple two triple a's

414
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,439
very quick to change the batteries every

415
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
it saves all the data when you change

416
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
batteries

417
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,879
but it's always running in the

418
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,199
background as soon as you put the

419
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,519
batteries in

420
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,679
here's what i just showed you only big

421
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,759
there's the usc cable there's the

422
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,078
batteries they're in the compartment

423
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,079
this is gasketed in the bottom

424
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,278
and then right in here it's hard to see

425
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,519
here is the usb for downloading the

426
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,519
data

427
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,039
this is what the screen looks like once

428
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,879
you download the data it's just a

429
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,159
standard excel file

430
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,000
i don't know if you can see this but

431
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,000
days ago is right here

432
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
dli on that day and photo period on that

433
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,039
day

434
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,518
so it tells you what's going on

435
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,480
now another feature that we put into

436
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,839
this

437
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
was

438
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
30 minute averages

439
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,640
for

440
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:08,639
light intensity for the past 10 days

441
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,280
because sometimes you want to know is it

442
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,400
clearly cloudy was it was it bright and

443
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,038
sunny

444
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,600
so here's days ago and a 30 minute

445
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,558
average let's do that in blue 30 minute

446
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,318
average of ppfd look at this data if we

447
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,359
graph this data

448
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,558
we get up to 500 so this is a nice sunny

449
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,719
day

450
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,960
if we graph that data to look like this

451
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,558
and we'd get up to 500 in the middle of

452
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,000
the day not a sunny summer day but still

453
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,879
still gives you the average for the day

454
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,119
dli let's let's let me walk you through

455
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,799
the interpretation of that

456
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,959
jim faust dr jim faust one of our great

457
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,679
colleagues

458
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,360
visited the lab has done a lot of work

459
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:59,759
helping people interpret dli numbers

460
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:02,879
this is just a generic chart on dli

461
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,960
in moles per day this is moles per meter

462
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
squared per day

463
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,360
they didn't put the dli in this chart

464
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,639
remember i showed you some numbers i was

465
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,399
getting about 10 in my greenhouse in the

466
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
winter at home

467
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
okay here's a list of crops these are

468
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,279
all

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,279
flowering ornamentals

470
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,120
white means too low can't grow it

471
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,360
yellow means just barely it's going to

472
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,678
struggle it's going to be floppy

473
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,639
green is better and red is excellent if

474
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,960
you got red you get plenty of light

475
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,120
so at 10 i could grow most of these

476
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,360
crops i would have some

477
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,759
trouble with crops down here not quite

478
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,199
enough light

479
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,440
if this was medical hemp the more the

480
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,279
better we would be we would want to be

481
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,240
up to 20 or even 30 and now we go off

482
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,839
scale we go even higher than 30 with

483
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,720
medical hemp

484
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,879
so some and lettuce we'd like to be up

485
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,360
in this region this doesn't have lettuce

486
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,120
we'd like to be up in this region here

487
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:13,279
for lettuce 16 to 20 moles a day

488
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,279
this meter tells us if we get there

489
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,400
if you search the internet for

490
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,000
james faust

491
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,360
dli

492
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,519
you will get a series of maps

493
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,798
for average dli for places in the united

494
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,079
states

495
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:36,000
on average and with the season this is

496
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,720
not inside a greenhouse this is just

497
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,079
outside

498
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,558
here's january dli and man these numbers

499
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,960
are purple i mean up in here this is

500
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,038
just not enough light to grow plants we

501
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,120
put supplemental lights in

502
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,400
down here it's still low

503
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,759
but you can

504
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,759
look at typical dli values on average

505
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,960
from a month at a time

506
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,000
from

507
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,440
this this website there's james faust

508
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,440
right there he's at clemson

509
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,360
and if you follow football you know

510
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,279
about the clemson um

511
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,038
i won't say any more than that but

512
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,319
they've had a good year

513
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,480
um

514
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,480
so

515
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,279
let me

516
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,279
close on this i think i've said

517
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,480
everything i want to

518
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,839
um

519
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,319
why is photo period important

520
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,558
some crops are short day

521
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,439
some crops are long day

522
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,678
and the short day crops need to be below

523
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,320
a threshold medical hemp is a short day

524
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,798
crop typically we want that to be less

525
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,399
than a 12 hour photo period if you're

526
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,720
getting photo periods

527
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,600
13 14 hours you're going to have trouble

528
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,640
getting hemp to flower

529
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,079
long day crops follow flower faster in

530
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,400
long days

531
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,918
and many of our crops are long day

532
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,000
plants wheat is a is a long day crop

533
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,480
so you want long photo periods for those

534
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,440
that's where the photo period comes in

535
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,679
now there's one key thing about this new

536
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,400
dli meter that i got to share with you

537
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,480
that's not so intuitively obvious but we

538
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,038
have come to this

539
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,200
as we look at crops

540
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,798
medical hemp and a lot of other crops in

541
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,240
the field

542
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,839
as you know apogee makes a light bar for

543
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,839
measuring

544
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,000
light penetration to the bottom of the

545
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,000
canopy and if light gets to the bottom

546
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,519
those photons are wasted so you want to

547
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,400
capture the light

548
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,599
but that light bar only works

549
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
per second

550
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,439
and you measure above and below the

551
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,558
canopy

552
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,240
but in a greenhouse the sun moves and

553
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,918
through the sky

554
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,640
so how are you going to introdu

555
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
integrate that light capture through the

556
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,480
day

557
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,798
well you can use the dli meter to do

558
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,440
that let me give you an example

559
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,839
here's a bunch of crops right we get

560
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,240
leaves all over the place here

561
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,639
um for a crop

562
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,720
if we put and and

563
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,640
we'll put this dli meter up here in

564
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,519
yellow one meter up here

565
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,000
for incoming light and it comes at all

566
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,000
angles through the day

567
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,440
like this

568
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,359
and then we take a second meter

569
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,759
and we put it down here

570
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,879
at the bottom of the crop

571
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,400
now this also integrates the light

572
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,640
through the day

573
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,559
at all angles

574
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,960
so the difference be this is in

575
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,038
this is out

576
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,558
and in minus out

577
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:52,079
oops that's a minus in minus out

578
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,079
equals absorbed

579
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
this is a really powerful technique to

580
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,038
tell how your canopy is doing how much

581
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,360
light capture did it get

582
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,000
and two sensors like this give you the

583
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,759
daily light integral for both of them in

584
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,480
a way that you can't get if you just

585
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:13,519
have a single meter once a second in

586
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,919
here you want to integrate all the light

587
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,720
so this is a creative use of this that's

588
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,559
been really useful for us in our

589
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,960
research

590
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,200
now following in this same principle

591
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,120
where we're doing capture

592
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,798
how about you have your greenhouse right

593
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,399
here your greenhouse roof

594
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,359
how much what's the

595
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,480
penetration of photons inside your

596
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,839
greenhouse

597
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,599
if you mount one out here

598
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,439
and you have one inside this doesn't

599
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,798
have to be straight above just above the

600
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,679
greenhouse

601
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:50,879
the ratio of these this is the same math

602
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,559
in minus out equals absorbed

603
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,080
and you'll be surprised at how much

604
00:23:52,558 --> 00:24:00,158
greenhouses absorb a typical greenhouse

605
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,759
can absorb half of the photons and then

606
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,278
people go up and clean the glass and

607
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,679
they go oh my god you know we should

608
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,159
have done that years ago

609
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,440
this really helps to make sure your

610
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,400
greenhouse is

611
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
clean

612
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,600
it's the same thing with

613
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,240
even electric lights do you need to

614
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,359
clean electric lights getting a ratio of

615
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,599
in and out

616
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,678
integrated through the day so both of

617
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,359
these have been really useful for this

618
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,600
meter

619
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,599
so

620
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,840
i'm going to close on this slide

621
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:34,079
here's the three models the

622
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,839
400 the 500

623
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,519
and the 600

624
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:43,199
if you search for apogee dli meter

625
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,200
you'll come right to this page

626
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,599
this is an exciting development we've

627
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
been refining this for

628
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,439
some time

629
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,600
to get peak accuracy and peak

630
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,000
functionality we've had prototypes out

631
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,759
with a lot of people to give us feedback

632
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,839
on how to do this

633
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,038
for me this is one of the most exciting

634
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,038
things we've

635
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,640
introduced in a while

636
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,240
i think it's really going to help our

637
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,559
users

638
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,038
let me mention one final thing

639
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,839
if you want to know the level up from

640
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,079
this

641
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,918
the light oh during the night and more

642
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,038
detailed data

643
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,759
you still can buy our micro cache with

644
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,640
sensors and download that data to your

645
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,200
phone

646
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,960
this gives you more detailed data than

647
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,400
the dli meter

648
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,360
but it's it's

649
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,640
also more money too so there's still

650
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,879
multiple options for measuring this

651
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,360
thanks for listening we'll pick this up

652
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,360
in the next video

653
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
you
