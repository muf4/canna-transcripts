00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello, my name is Schuyler Smith, and I do technical sales and support here at Apogee

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,919
Instruments. And today we're going to do a Quickstart video for how to connect your PQ-500/PQ-510,

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:21,240
which is the SQ-500-SS with the AT-100, which is the µCache Bluetooth logger. So in this

4
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:27,879
video, we're going to cover the Apogee Connect app download, the Apogee Connect and connecting

5
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:32,679
to the µCache, and then making sure your sensor is set up correctly in the app, and

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,600
then we're going to go over setting up logging to the µCache logger and then how to collect

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,149
those logs after you've come back to the sensor. So the first thing is the app. This is what

8
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:49,149
the app looks like. Over here you can see the iOS when you search for Apogee Connect.

9
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:55,320
And then over there is the Google Play — what it will look like there. So go ahead and download

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:03,989
that to your phone or tablet. Next up this is the Quickstart Guide that we include with

11
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:09,329
the µCache in the sensor. And so if you've lost that you can just pause on this screen,

12
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,969
and you can look at these directions. We're going to go through each one of these. And

13
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:18,859
then this page is the Quickstart guide on how to set up logging — how to begin logging

14
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:25,640
the first time. And then over here we're going to do the Quickstart guide to collecting logs

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,129
from the µCache after it's been logging and how to go out and get that. So again you're

16
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:42,789
welcome to pause on the video to review those. And now we will do a demonstration... Give

17
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:49,270
that a second to come up... Alright so right here you can see we have an iOS device, and

18
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:52,789
we've just opened the Apogee Connect app. So this is what yours will look like the first

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,530
time you come into it. So the first thing we want to do is get the µCache advertising.

20
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,780
So we hold down the green button for 3 seconds, starts blinking blue, and then nothing happens

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,118
over here until we hit add “+”. So we hit add “+” up in the corner, and then

22
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:14,280
now it comes up. It says “uc1080.” So we look on the back of this, says “1080.”

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,360
So we know that is the correct one, we click on it, and then it's going to come up and

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,950
it says SP-110. We don't have an SP-110. We have a SQ-500. So we need to change that.

25
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,219
And we start by clicking on choose model. And then when we're here, we're going to scroll

26
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:38,830
down until we find the SQ-500. We're going to click on it. Okay. It does not have a custom

27
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,880
calibration. It's the standard calibration for the SQ-500. And then if we want to rename

28
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,340
it, if we're expecting a couple, we can name it whatever we want. But we can just put “home”

29
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:59,219
on here for now. And then we can hit add. So we've changed the name to home. We're showing

30
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,849
on this screen now that it’s connected and then here not logging. So if we come in here

31
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,840
after it's not connected and open up Apogee Connect, we'll see an X through connected.

32
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,800
So now that we're here, we can go into this sensor. Alright and the first thing we see

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,520
is that we are reading accurate values right there, and we can get that to increase or

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,159
decrease just by changing it. Okay. And then if we want to go to live meter mode, we can

35
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,590
click right there.And it is updating our live meter as we

36
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,900
speak. And then if we want to collect the data, we can record the current value just

37
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,810
by clicking here. And it's going to record that in the table below. And then again this

38
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,770
table updates based on the amount of light that we're shining on it. Now you can see

39
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,260
that it's a very fast updating right now. If we wanted to average out that live sample

40
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:01,489
data, we can do that under settings. And we'll show you that here in a second. Now it is

41
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,591
important to note that on this graph it does go away if I click “back” and go to a

42
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:11,780
different screen. And so it's only live meter right now as you're looking at it. It's not

43
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,439
saving this graph anywhere else. So this is perfect for going around doing spot measurements

44
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:25,569
and seeing how the light changes depending on where we move that sensor around. So now

45
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:32,540
let's talk about setting up logging as well as various settings we can go into. So the

46
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,370
first thing... so settings we don't have a custom calibration. We can rename it here

47
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,620
if we didn't like “home” and we want to name it something else. We don't need to worry

48
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,180
about dark offset calibration with this sensor. And this is logging enabled. We're going to

49
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,740
come back here and enable this here in a second. Water correction — this is what you want

50
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,430
to turn on if you're using this underwater in aquarium and coral

51
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:04,129
reef applications. And so you turn on that correction factor, which then turns this into

52
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:10,240
the equivalent of reading the same as like a MQ-510 that we offer. You can have “notify

53
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:18,639
when full” when you're logging your data points. It can log up to 400,000 data points.

54
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,829
But if you're doing it for a long time in the field you can click that. This is that

55
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:28,409
setting we mentioned before “live data averaging.” Currently, it's averaging samples over one

56
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,090
second and reporting that, but you can see that you can increase this up to as high as

57
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:41,769
thirty seconds on that live data averaging. And then we have some information down here:

58
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:46,629
the hardware version, the firmware version, and then sensor time. Now you're always going

59
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:51,659
to want to match current time when you get in here to do this. And then that way it matches

60
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:59,890
the time in here that's logging, the time date stamps, and then to what your phone is.

61
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,110
So that way when you go to collect the logs later those numbers are already set and matched.

62
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,569
And then update sensor firmware. You're welcome the first time you get that to click on that.

63
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,500
When you're connected to it you click start. It will go ahead and check itself. It's now

64
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:24,079
a red LED. It's going through... you can see it's updating it to the latest version that's

65
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:30,740
available to it. Then it's completed. And then you're going to see it blink blue. And

66
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:38,180
now it’s back connected. So that's a quick process as needed. So let's go back up here

67
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,639
to setting up logging. So oh I'm sorry we went over dark threshold. Dark threshold right

68
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,860
here okay. So the dark threshold means how much light you're willing to hit the sensor

69
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,500
and let it and say that it is dark. Some people are willing to go up to 2 µmols or 2.5 µmols.

70
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,069
Some people need it less than that. So you can change that dark threshold to whatever

71
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,500
you want, which is important when you're logging your daily light

72
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,759
integrals and your photoperiods. So you can move that around to what you want. But it

73
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:23,110
comes standard at 0.5 µmols m⁻² s⁻¹. All right logging enabled. So we slide logging

74
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:30,080
enabled on, and then it comes up as 10-minute logging interval and one-minute sampling.

75
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,300
So that means that in this example it will take 10 readings because it's doing one every

76
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,521
minute, and then every 10 minutes it's logging it. So 1 reading every minute, and then it

77
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:46,919
will average all 10 of those and log that data. So we recommend 15 minutes for our logging

78
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:53,769
interval and then your sampling interval we’ll give you equivalence of that out to here.

79
00:07:53,769 --> 00:08:00,288
So you can do every 2.5 minutes for sampling. Now the reason that we encourage 15-minute

80
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:06,430
logging period is because it affects the battery life. By having a 15-minute logging average,

81
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,769
if you're just going for the daily totals of light, your battery is going to last you

82
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:16,668
know nine months to a year depending on other conditions, temperature, and stuff. But if

83
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:23,769
we go logging interval all the way down to you know less than 10 seconds… sampling

84
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:29,519
intervals less than 10 seconds will decrease battery life. And that can decrease it all

85
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:36,119
the way down to a week — down to weeks instead of months. So you definitely want to make

86
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:41,009
sure that you're logging and sampling interval is set up for whatever your application is,

87
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:46,629
but just know it will take a toll on the battery if it is too quick. So let's get this out

88
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:52,850
to a minute or so. Okay. And then we have to hit save down here. Once we hit save now

89
00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:00,829
it's saved in there okay. And it says we started right here and it will be filled by 2032.

90
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:11,849
So we have quite a ways before our data will be filled. All right so now our logging is

91
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,450
enabled okay. And so because we did a firmware update it came through and it gives us this

92
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,940
big number. But we know that those logs are not correct. So we want to clear the logs.

93
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:30,329
So we clear logs down to zero. Okay so now it currently has zero logs to gain. But how

94
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:36,189
do we set it up for field logging the first time once we want to collect logs? So we click

95
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,220
on collect logs. And then we come here to create new, which is what it automatically

96
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,300
comes on. And then new data set right here. We can rename that whatever we want. And then

97
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:51,998
we do the start time and the end time down below, and these should be auto-filled because

98
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:57,180
the start time is when we enabled logging and then end time is the current time. And

99
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:03,778
then you just hit collect logs. Well, right now there's zero. And so down below it is

100
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:11,039
giving us that there is no data collected, and so our graphs down here have not been

101
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:18,328
updated. So for our demonstration, we will grab this PQ-500 we have right here and we'll

102
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:26,179
bring it over. So it's the same sensor and µCache. So on this screen, we're going to

103
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:32,208
hold down until it blinks blue — hold down the green button until it blinks blue — then

104
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:36,219
we will add it. Searching for devices. It says “Schuyler's Yard” because that's

105
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,360
the experiment I was running. I was looking for the best spot for a garden in my yard.

106
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,699
So we can connect to this. It remembers that it's a SQ-500, but since it's the first time

107
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:55,488
on this phone it's asking me if it's correct. I say add, and we can see that our µmol value

108
00:10:55,489 --> 00:11:02,369
is very similar since they're right here both on the platform. So let's go into it, and

109
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:09,420
we can see logs available for collection is 7. Okay and down here it has never collected

110
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:16,370
logs, and so we don't see any data down here. Now I'm going to collect logs, and so again

111
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,409
it's the first time on this phone. So I'm going to “create new,” and I'm going to

112
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:33,338
call it “2020 Garden.” So we can just rename that right there. And then its start

113
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:38,800
time and end time. Now because I just connected it, the start time says 2:15; however, I know

114
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,309
that the data goes all the way back to April. But I, for the sake of time, I just want to

115
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:52,039
collect about a week's worth of data. So we'll go back to Tuesday, June 9th, and let's go

116
00:11:52,039 --> 00:12:05,368
to midnight... so get that to 12:00 a.m. Okay. So we set that. So that's our start time/end

117
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:11,589
time. And then we're going to collect logs. And it jumps from 7 that it had been collecting

118
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:19,360
within the last couple minutes to 2000. Okay so once it's done downloading all of this

119
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,709
data, it's going to auto-populate down here. And this is going to give us our µmols per

120
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:33,268
day down here. And then this is going to give us our moles per day or our DLI (daily light

121
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:40,459
integral). And then our photoperiod is going to be here. So it just takes a little while.

122
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:59,869
I’m already halfway through. And then we will see the data pop up underneath... Okay

123
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,889
so we can see right here a couple days it's been in the office. Before that, it was out

124
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:10,068
in the yard. We can see some beautiful clear days, and then we can see some rainy days

125
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:15,748
out in my yard. And then down here is the real gem where we can see our DLI values,

126
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:21,170
and we can see we're between 40 and 50 moles per day for the place that I'm going to put

127
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:26,870
my tomatoes in the ground. And then down here we can see the photoperiod, which is just

128
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:36,028
about 16 hours a day currently right now in June for Logan, Utah. Now any time after this

129
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:41,470
that I want to collect logs, I'm going to collect logs, I'm going to append existing,

130
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,879
and then I'm going to hit collect logs. And it said zero because we have zero right now,

131
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,950
but in a couple minutes that will have another log and then another. And so from this point

132
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:57,459
on I just want to collect logs I just want to append to existing and then collect logs,

133
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:03,838
and then it will automatically update these graphs below. And then if I want the data...

134
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,299
so I can view the data... and then right here is that share button so I can export it out

135
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:15,838
to myself and email all that data. So then I could analyze it under my own excel sheet

136
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:23,670
as needed. So with that, that concludes our Quickstart video. If you have any questions

137
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:29,578
