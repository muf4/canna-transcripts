2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,759
This is Death Valley

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,160
the hottest place on Earth

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:18,480
at least for now.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,240
For a brief 90 year span, from 1922 to 2013

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,599
the title of the hottest place on Earth

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,000
actually belonged to Aziziya Libya,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,320
for an air temperature reading of 136° F.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,280
But, no longer.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,960
So how does a location loose the title as hottest place on Earth?

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,320
Well, by cheating, intentionally

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,719
or more likely unintentionally.

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,960
There are many factors that contribute to accurate

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,439
recording of air temperature.

15
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,719
Of the 681 page Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods and Observation,

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,519
produced by the WMO,

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,080
pages 43 - 63 provide guidance on proper measurement of air temperature.

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,399
Yes it's extremely detailed, but it needs to be

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,480
because of all the variables that come into play when recording air temperature.     

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:14,920
So let's take a moment and see how Aiziziya lost their world record.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,079
[Music]

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,079
Before 1919 the weather station in Aziziya was placed in town.

23
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,959
But in 1919 they moved the station to a hilltop fort

24
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,159
where it was placed on top of black tarmac.

25
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,319
Surface temperature are typically higher than  air temperatures because of solar radiation.

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,199
The rays of the sun go down and are absorbed into the surface.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,520
The color of that surface can dramatically change how much heat is absorbed.

28
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,359
Because the weather station was placed above black tarmac

29
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,620
the air above becomes superheated  and artificially high.

30
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,800
Also, the original thermometer had been damaged

31
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,480
and replaced by an uncalibrated thermometer

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,359
typically used in a greenhouse or environment not intended for this kind of measurement.

33
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,760
A classic case of using the the wrong tool at the wrong time.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,439
Finally, the usual record keeper was replaced by an inexperienced or untrained observer

35
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,800
who the WHO believes incorrectly read the thermometer

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,600
due to that thermometer particular style.

37
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,519
This is assumed due to the change in the handwriting shortly

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,800
before the historical measurement.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,520
When you look at the list of evidence and see how the trends changed over time

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
you can see why the validity of the Aziziya temperature was called into question.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,880
After reviewing the evidence the WMO decertified the 1922 reading

42
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,560
and gave the title of hottest place on earth to Furnace Creek in Death Valley California

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,780
for a measurement in July of 1913 for a measurement of 134°F.

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,680
(Cough) Did you say 1913?

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,800
Since the Aziziya desertification,

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,560
The 1913 record in Death Valley has also raised significant accuracy questions.

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,439
So could Death Valley loose its title as hottest place on Earth?

48
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,000
Potentially but probably not.

49
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,799
Randy Cerveny a geography professor at 

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Arizona State University and  member of the WHO stated,

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,039
"We accept the Death Valley temperature extreme record."

52
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,879
"Obviously if any new material on it surfaces, We will be prepared to open an investigation,"

53
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,560
"but at this time all available  evidence points to its legitimacy."

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,759
If the Death Valley record were decertified

55
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,399
then it's a tie for the third place

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,960
with a temperature of 129.2 degrees between Mitribah Kuwait in July of 2016,

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,560
and also Furnace Creek in Death Valley of June 2013.

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
A number that's going to stick.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:47,443
On a side note there are two recorded measures of 129.9

60
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:47,477
in August of 2020 and July of 2021

61
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:47,542
both in Furnace Creek that are currently pending certification.

62
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:47,621
So how do you increase your measurements accuracy and prevent false readings?

63
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:47,695
We recommend using a shield that protects the sensor from solar radiation.

64
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:47,719
A shield like the TS100.

65
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,280
In addition to a shield that protects the sensor from solar radiation

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,240
the TS100 also uses a low power fan,

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,600
a fan that allows air to circulate and prevent errors caused by stagnant air

68
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,280
sitting inside the sensor body.

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,719
Also, being white and reflective reduces the shield's thermal conductivity.

70
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,280
Because of these factors, the TS100 is an excellent solution

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,039
if you're wanting a low-cost, high accuracy measurement shield

72
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,479
much like this station in Death Valley.

73
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,000
This station is set up as a collaboration

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
between Campbell Scientific and the NWS.

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
So the next time you're going for a world record or looking to get higher quality data

76
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
consider using the TS100 a low power,

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
fan aspirated, temperature  shield from Apogee Instruments.

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,600
Thank you so much for  watching and have a great day.
