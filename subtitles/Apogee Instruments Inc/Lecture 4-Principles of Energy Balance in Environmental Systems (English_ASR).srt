1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,638
series and I want to get some closure

2
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:12,240
Ryan today on this topic of energy

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:14,160
balance um but there's one little tidbit

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,000
I want to point out before I get into

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,600
the Earth's energy

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,198
balance this is a graph remember how we

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,359
said the radiation can go above a

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,679
thousand because of Reflection from

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,359
clouds and that causes all kinds of

10
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:32,960
people to panic about things this was

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,079
happens to be some data from the campus

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,439
environmental Observatory for last

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,320
January but it was a series of days that

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:46,359
were partly

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,920
cloudy so there's a black line on here

16
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:53,238
that is the calculated radiation for a

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
clear sky now this is winter so note it

18
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:57,799
only goes to about

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,600
450 watts per meter squared but that's

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:04,158
the value for the winter so here's three

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,599
different replicate radiometers in here

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,118
and this was partly cloudy this is

23
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,519
partly cloudy this was very cloudy then

24
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:16,400
look at this day right here the clouds

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,959
acted like a lens like we talked about

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,079
and even though the clear sky was about

27
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,759
450 we had readings of

28
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:27,839
650 on the instrument that wasn't bad

29
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,719
instruments it was reflection of light

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,520
by clouds so sometimes these can go way

31
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,239
above clear sky by uh radiation focusing

32
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,000
on

33
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:41,199
them and then we calculate Nat and

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,040
shortwave on here in addition but the

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,320
main point here was to show this but it

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,040
has been very useful for us to calculate

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,879
a clear sky

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,680
radiation so you can tell here's a day

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,519
when it was clear sky and the

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,280
instruments are close to the model they

41
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:06,640
came up with the sky came down with the

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,800
sky so because the clear sky model is so

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,400
useful we've there's a website that

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,560
shows this it's I can show it on the

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,560
magnet here's the magnet right

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,199
here and I

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,800
can many of you have this magnet boy you

48
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:29,598
got to they're really uh bonded

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
together this is the third mag third and

50
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,759
Fin

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,000
magnet that we're going to talk about

52
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,560
and this is that clear sky

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,878
calculator.com

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,598
and it for any time a day any point in

55
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:49,079
the world this calculates the clear sky

56
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:52,199
and it's particularly accurate at solar

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,680
noon and you can use it to tell if your

58
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,959
instruments need to be

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,080
re-calibrated we all of our tests with

60
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:06,598
this indicate in the summer at solar

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,760
noon this is within 2% of the True Value

62
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:11,439
um the coefficients you put in here

63
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,719
include humidity and temperature because

64
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,919
of atmospheric attenuation elevation

65
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,680
latitude of course time of year um

66
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,399
calculate radiation anywhere in the

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,799
world that's just a little tidbit that's

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,158
been really useful to help people make

69
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,519
better measurements for uh radiation and

70
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,719
it's fairly widely used think it could

71
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,519
be used a lot more widely um for people

72
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:40,120
to make better

73
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:43,438
measurements so now this is the outline

74
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,280
for today where we hope to get to

75
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,199
radiation balance of the earth I think

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,759
it's real interesting as soon as we get

77
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,798
these numbers and we can figure out

78
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,719
radiation for a leaf how's this look if

79
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,959
we do the whole planet

80
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,680
and this

81
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,360
is the I guess I need

82
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,000
to maybe not don't need to zoom in or

83
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,560
out there it is the whole planet there's

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,199
many diagrams like this but this is one

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,519
of my

86
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,279
favorites I stopped into pole Campbell's

87
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,720
office a year ago and he had this on the

88
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,638
wall of his office and it's I gave it to

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,400
him and he loved it so we put it on his

90
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:28,319
wall here's all the incoming solar

91
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:30,279
energy to the Earth so 6% boom right off

92
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,519
the bat reflected by the atmosphere

93
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,758
right back into

94
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,079
space clouds this is a variable if

95
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:41,000
there's more clouds more reflection but

96
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:44,279
some clouds and then finally Earth

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
surface pretty small

98
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,879
reflection

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,639
um absorbed by the atmosphere a tiny bit

100
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,759
but then finally here's the absorbed by

101
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,079
land and oceans and then this warms up

102
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,800
and it radiates into space as long wave

103
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,399
radiation so it's coming in as shortwave

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,319
and it's going out as long wave I love

105
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,719
these colors cuz the burner on a stove

106
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:14,038
is glows red and that's longwave

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:17,320
radiation so um all of these are small

108
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,879
numbers but you can see how this is a

109
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,599
delicate balance if this radiation

110
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,800
balance

111
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,240
changes

112
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,520
and for all the apparent controversy

113
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,000
about global warming

114
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:36,839
we know CO2 absorbs longwave radiation

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,160
we know CO2 is going up we can

116
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:44,758
mathematically calculate the absorption

117
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:48,800
of CO2 of radiation by CO2 in the air

118
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,919
and calculate the heating caused by that

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,680
so you could say how could this be

120
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:57,198
controversial these are known physical

121
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,319
principles and as we say the absorption

122
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,160
of longwave radiation of by CO2

123
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,840
is unassailable we we know exactly how

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,240
it

125
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:12,399
changes this cooling by longwave

126
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,639
radiation here's the amazing thing about

127
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,519
this remember we had well you could see

128
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,879
them on here n there's not numbers on

129
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,120
here but this is a th watts in the

130
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:27,199
middle of the day coming in these are

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,598
big numbers here's a

132
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,840
paper by a whole bunch of authors

133
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:36,759
one of the key authors is James Hansen

134
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,799
who was quite famous for in circles he's

135
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,560
a testified before Congress many times

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,960
on this and look at how many offers they

137
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,800
put in these papers um but look at this

138
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:52,478
our climate model driven by human-made

139
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,759
greenhouse gases aerosols calculates the

140
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,758
Earth is now

141
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,759
absorbing

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,160
0.85 watts per met squar more energy

143
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:07,359
than the sun then it's emitting to

144
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,800
space less than one watt is the energy

145
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,038
in balance of the earth now he puts a

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,879
plus or minus

147
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,038
0.15 that's those are some serious

148
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,199
models you're not saying oh this is less

149
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:23,918
than 5% we'll throw that out all that

150
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,080
stuff matters so even though these are

151
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,598
known physical principles the energy

152
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:33,439
imbalance is small but it's enough to

153
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:35,800
cause the temperature to rise um I think

154
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,439
the only controversy about global

155
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,038
warming is what's the effect of rising

156
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:44,240
temperature yes it's rising and yes it's

157
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:48,038
caused by CO2 and yes the CO2 is caused

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,360
by people so can Canadians have a

159
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,519
t-shirt that says I'm in favor of global

160
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,479
warming so so some people it's not a bad

161
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,439
thing to them and then people say well

162
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:00,719
look it's going to melt the ice caps

163
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,360
raise the ocean Miami will be flooded

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,639
so they can

165
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,439
move that's there's the controversy it's

166
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,400
not what's happening it's how serious is

167
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:15,680
the problem and that's where we get into

168
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,878
erratic weather if all that happened was

169
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,639
a slow steady increase in temperature a

170
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,520
few tents of a degree per decade we can

171
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,560
deal with that but if the weather goes

172
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,719
chaotic now we got a big problem and

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,879
there's the Cutting Edge of climate

174
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,918
science research is will global warming

175
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:42,320
cause erratic weather and there's lots

176
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:44,399
of evidence that it does but there

177
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,440
people disagree about how much erratic

178
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,000
weathers might happen if it changes

179
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,200
rainfall patterns that's a big deal that

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,320
can change agriculture it could it can

181
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,959
cause a lot famine for a lot of people

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
just by shifts and rainfall patterns so

183
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,719
to me

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,759
That's The Cutting Edge of climate

185
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,200
change research um not whether it's

186
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:10,319
happening but what are the long-term

187
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,320
consequences going to be but I when I

188
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,120
read this paper I it it was some years

189
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,120
ago but I just about fell out of my

190
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,278
chair I think of when you think of the

191
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,120
fluxes of these

192
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,360
numbers so I want to go into this a tiny

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,360
bit

194
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,120
more several years ago got to zoom out

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,839
on this NASA

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,480
got ready to launch a satellite called

197
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,839
glory and and this is a brochure on

198
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Glory understanding the Earth's energy

199
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,399
budget now NASA has lots of satellites

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,120
doing this already but this one had

201
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,480
specialized instruments to get some of

202
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,639
the Lesser known parameters to measure

203
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,480
them more accurately and we were all so

204
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,399
excited about this

205
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,320
satellite it took years of work and had

206
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,879
really expensive in instruments it blew

207
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,440
up on launch

208
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,439
and it and now we're trying to get money

209
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,839
again to launch another version of it

210
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,839
but in this

211
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,079
brochure was a

212
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,240
two-page

213
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,599
analysis of the Earth's energy budget

214
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,039
that I thought was the best short

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,159
summary I had ever read of this so I'm

216
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,240
sharing it with

217
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:34,399
you the this

218
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,480
is I have two handouts one here's one is

219
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,519
the what I just showed which shows

220
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,600
percentages of all these arrows and now

221
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,039
you have a a sense of what those arrows

222
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
all look like on a single leaf apply the

223
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,879
same principles to the whole

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,399
planet this one shows absolute numbers

225
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,559
on this I might be able to focus this a

226
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,879
tiny bit

227
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,518
better um this one shows absolute

228
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:03,320
numbers you can't see them here but they

229
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,039
on this handout um and what's reflected

230
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,200
and absorbed and of course these numbers

231
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,480
change as the Earth rotates we're not

232
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,959
always measuring it right pointed at the

233
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,879
sun there's nighttime in there and we're

234
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:20,119
on the edges but it but in a nutshell

235
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:22,039
this shows these so here's another

236
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,799
reason another thing that helps you

237
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:29,719
understand some of the controversy in

238
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,599
this here's radiative

239
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,040
what's called radiative forcings which

240
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,639
is just another name for what's causing

241
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,159
this and I want to zoom in on this just

242
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,240
a little

243
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,519
bit radiative forcing components now

244
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,480
this is becoming more and more common

245
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,159
for people to express their data like

246
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,120
this but if you haven't seen this before

247
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,679
and people debate the size of the error

248
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,278
bars on these but it also helps you

249
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,120
understand the controversy about global

250
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,159
warning so if it that bar goes up that

251
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,919
means it's a factor causing the Earth to

252
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,600
get warmer if it goes down it's a factor

253
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,479
causing Earth to get colder so if

254
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,519
there's things on here that

255
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,680
reflected radiation the Earth would cool

256
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:17,399
and if they absorb it gets warmer here's

257
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:20,039
CO2 the biggest bar in this graph in the

258
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,958
end over here is the net of everything

259
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:26,599
here's CO2 that error bar is our that

260
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:29,198
difference among the models of what CO2

261
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,159
is doing and they're not all the same

262
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:36,278
and this is watts per met

263
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:39,559
squared so 1.5 1.6 watts per met squ

264
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:43,639
Plus or minus1 or02 that's not very

265
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:48,439
controversial we we understand this

266
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:51,560
methane nitrogen oxide gases and hoc

267
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,320
carbons are real powerful absorbers of

268
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,278
longwave radiation so just traces of

269
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,959
these have a big effect and cumulatively

270
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:04,198
these add about another Wat per meter

271
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:06,119
squared these have been going into the

272
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:08,439
atmosphere before they were people but

273
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,839
human activities have increased these

274
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,680
other gases as well there's a lot of

275
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,560
work on methane and nitrogen oxides and

276
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:21,759
other things now in addition to just

277
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:24,000
CO2 so then we go into ozone and there's

278
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,879
El tiny elements of cooling and heating

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,720
this is a much smaller bar but a bigger

280
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:32,679
error bar on that um Stratos pheric

281
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,800
water vapor tiny changes in atmospheric

282
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,679
water water absorbs long wave radiation

283
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:43,000
so if the humidity changes it it drives

284
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:46,198
warming but not very much then albo if

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,759
we painted the Earth white we'd cool it

286
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:53,838
off well land use changes can mean that

287
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,959
more radiation gets reflected into space

288
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,120
if we have big forests they absorb a lot

289
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,679
of radiation we cut them down we just

290
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,120
have bare ground

291
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,838
we reflect more radiation into space so

292
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,240
there's bigger error bars here but it's

293
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,000
plus or minus now we get to

294
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,278
aerosols droplets tiny droplets of

295
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,679
things in the air they're if we had a

296
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:17,600
microscope you could see them but

297
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:22,120
they're they're uh droplets of liquids

298
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,680
in the air they reflect radiation and

299
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,519
look at the size of these error bars

300
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,399
Cloud albo

301
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,440
effect those clouds that are caus cusing

302
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,919
us complications in our model if it's

303
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,600
cloudy all the time the Earth is going

304
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,639
to cool so that's one of the huge

305
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,879
variables in here is what the clouds do

306
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,680
because look at the size of that error

307
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:47,039
bar um clouds are aerosols after all so

308
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,758
they're in this category and then a

309
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,759
couple other tiny factors changes in

310
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,560
solar radiation people said the sun is

311
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,399
just putting out more

312
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,278
energy well yes it is there it is it's

313
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,720
above zero and and with a pretty big a

314
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,480
bar but this is not a big effect um we

315
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,079
would like to say it's all this party on

316
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,278
don't worry these things are minor

317
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,159
compared to the Sun but the data doesn't

318
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:17,078
support that hypothesis and here's the

319
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:20,439
net effect now this model shows about

320
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:24,078
1.6 watts per meter squared and the

321
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,839
paper I just showed had 85 watts per

322
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:30,000
meter squar so you can see where the

323
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:32,279
different models vary a little

324
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,480
but there are no models that say this is

325
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,480
zero and there are no models that say

326
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,000
it's a negative number they just vary in

327
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,920
the magnitude of the warming but this

328
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
helps explain why it's controversial

329
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,439
because some things make it cooler some

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,519
things make it warmer

331
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,600
um for years we've worked with NASA on

332
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,039
on long-term space missions growing Food

333
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,079
for People in space so one of the issues

334
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:01,599
is terraforming Mars can't we just start

335
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:04,479
making Mars more of a nicer Planet well

336
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,959
yeah but it's cold well we'll just fly

337
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,240
some stuff up there that turns it black

338
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,638
and makes a planet darker and then you

339
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,919
run the numbers and yeah that works you

340
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,720
can make Mars a darker color get the

341
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,958
absorption up it'll start to warm up

342
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,079
it'll melt the water into ice and pretty

343
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,599
soon we start to create an atmosphere up

344
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,318
there so they're literally as smart

345
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,519
people saying let's get Mars darker so

346
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,360
we can might take 50 100 years but let's

347
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,360
get it darker so we can go and live

348
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,079
there that's this is these application

349
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,680
of energy balance principles to whole

350
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:43,559
planets not just our

351
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,958
own whole universe has to follow the

352
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,399
first law of

353
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,879
thermodynamics far as we know we haven't

354
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,198
discovered a universe that doesn't have

355
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,759
to follow that so we take those

356
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,399
principles to other

357
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,440
places

358
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:01,318
so with all

359
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,160
the convers ation and debate about

360
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:05,159
global warming I think it's useful for

361
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:07,279
people to be a bit more educated

362
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,959
particularly when you get the principles

363
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,279
of shortwave and longwave radiation now

364
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,720
you can take those and apply them to

365
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,720
lots of

366
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,160
places

367
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,319
so I'm not sure where NASA is on another

368
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,720
satellite but but a big part of that one

369
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,720
was to do uh

370
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:33,599
aerosols this is following up now in my

371
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,919
order of my organization on a few little

372
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,918
things that we didn't get

373
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,000
into remember

374
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:51,319
when radiation

375
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:57,359
absorbed equals radiation

376
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:57,359
in Time 1 minus lbo

377
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:05,879
this is all fine and then we said for a

378
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:08,279
typical Leaf the albo is 1

379
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,320
minus

380
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,119
0.5 so

381
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:15,960
0.5

382
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:20,079
however here's shortwave radiation again

383
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,640
short and long here's the short wave

384
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:26,119
here's the long wave

385
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,640
l s over

386
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,959
here long wave is really pretty

387
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,600
consistent it doesn't matter what

388
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,480
wavelength it is for long wave as far as

389
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:40,359
absorption of materials matters a lot

390
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,240
for transmission through the atmosphere

391
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:47,839
but when we talk about longwave

392
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,839
radiation a number that's at

393
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:54,519
8,000 would behave similarly to 50,000

394
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,600
it's all those wavelengths are the same

395
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:01,798
this is not true for shortwave radiation

396
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:06,279
the the wavelengths matter a lot for

397
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:09,038
shortwave and when we say 50% Elbo or

398
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:12,519
25% when people talk about

399
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:15,519
albo they are talking about an average

400
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:18,279
of all the wavelengths and remember this

401
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:22,839
is about 280

402
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:24,720
nanom to 3,000 this whole thing is in

403
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,000
units of nanometers lots of times you

404
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,400
see this in

405
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,519
micrometers these wavings matter a

406
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,519
lot and

407
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:43,599
on now let me get get to this in a

408
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,600
second in the

409
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:48,519
textbook

410
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:52,839
[Music]

411
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,839
for right here figure

412
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,879
7.4 this shows for a typical

413
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,038
Leaf what's absorbed what's reflected

414
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,200
and what's transmitted and of course

415
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:11,000
this is very far from a flat line you

416
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:13,400
can see that 50% is an average so that's

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,079
okay we can use

418
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,759
50%

419
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:23,599
but here's photosynthetic radiation

420
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,839
micrometers point4 to 7 almost all

421
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,439
absorbed up this and remember this is

422
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,480
40% of the total almost all absorbed of

423
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,279
this this is what causes photosynthesis

424
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,000
so it's a good thing it's absorbed then

425
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:40,440
we get to 700 and there no the

426
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,880
chlorophyll molecule does not absorb

427
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,558
light past

428
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,120
700 it's just heat so I'm going to say

429
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:50,158
that plants are pretty

430
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,959
smart they let that thermal radiation go

431
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,600
right through or they reflect it and

432
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:01,679
this radiation is like 10% absorbed this

433
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,480
near INF red radiation and if we draw it

434
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,200
on our graph right

435
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,880
here we have

436
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,880
UV we have

437
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,159
4700 this

438
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,159
is

439
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,159
95%

440
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,840
absorbed this this radiation in here

441
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,519
then suddenly it gets just past that and

442
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,480
I control this and this part of it out

443
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:34,319
here is is

444
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,079
maybe 10% absorbed depends it depends on

445
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,158
the exact wavelength you can see this

446
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,960
bounces around out here a little

447
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:44,559
but it's so it's a little misleading it

448
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,278
simplifies the model a great deal to say

449
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,879
we just have one number for albo but

450
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:52,519
since we're dealing with plants and

451
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,120
and not

452
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:58,639
just parking lots and other surfaces

453
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:04,278
it's it's important to know that these

454
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:07,919
very a lot that's the diagram in the

455
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:09,839
book and lots of people diagram the same

456
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,200
thing in different

457
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,038
ways here's a diagram from another book

458
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,000
and I like this a little better cuz it's

459
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:23,000
not on a log scale so you can see it

460
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,960
better and now it has absorption here

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,240
photosynthetically active radiation 400

462
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:33,038
to 700 nanm this is green light so

463
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,000
little bit more green light bounces off

464
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,359
and little bit more is transmitted but

465
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,200
boom right at 700

466
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:44,319
nanm the reflection and transmission go

467
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,558
up and they're real low until we get out

468
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:50,519
here to 1.4

469
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:53,240
1.5 and then they become absorb more but

470
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,440
the amount of radiation is going down

471
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,519
like this so these are huge amounts here

472
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,038
and after we get out here there's just

473
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,359
much less

474
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,158
radiation this shows differential

475
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,719
absorption by the leaf of those

476
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,400
components

477
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,360
and I could tell you were worried about

478
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
this

479
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,759
because this is the handout from the

480
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,918
other day let me back off so you see the

481
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,679
whole thing

482
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,440
here this is the handout that talked

483
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:27,480
about typical values for Elbo

484
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,840
and emissivity of these and then if you

485
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,798
kept reading for being in advance you're

486
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,798
itchy to ask me what's going on with

487
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:39,839
these numbers down here and I think I

488
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:44,798
got to fold this to show it on the

489
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:47,798
bottom of this is what happens to this

490
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,798
radiation

491
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:54,839
there and I'll zoom in a bit but these

492
00:23:52,079 --> 00:24:00,119
are typical numbers on the bottom of

493
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:03,158
this and it Segways into long wave too

494
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:06,918
photosynthetic now on here I put 90%

495
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:10,679
absorbed and over here I put 90% it's

496
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,759
High um it depends on how thick the leaf

497
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,559
is whether it's 90 or

498
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,960
95 roughly equal amounts of reflection

499
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,798
and transmission to to 100% so great

500
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,240
there's photosynthetic boom we draw our

501
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:29,038
line and it switches to to uh mostly

502
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,079
reflection and transmission

503
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,398
and this is a big reason leaves can stay

504
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,798
cool they're not having to absorb that

505
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:37,879
thermal radiation it's of no value to

506
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:39,558
them unless they're cold and they want

507
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,640
to try and get warmer but they got

508
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:46,798
plenty of light to keep them warm so

509
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,520
then we go in this to longwave

510
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,798
radiation

511
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,798
and 4,000 to

512
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,880
100,000 this says micrometers and this

513
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,000
should say nanometers right here these

514
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,960
are all

515
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,440
nanometers so

516
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:12,720
96% absorbed of long wave and we had

517
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:16,840
emissivity and absorptivity of of

518
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,960
96 okay what happens to the other

519
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:22,759
0.004 if it's

520
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,960
not absorbed by the leaf and the answer

521
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:28,879
is it's reflected there was a tiny bit

522
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,880
of longwave radiation that gets

523
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,080
reflected by

524
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,559
surfaces tin

525
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,359
foil

526
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:41,359
reflects

527
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:45,079
97% of longwave radiation so for thermal

528
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:48,519
radiation tin foil is just like a mirror

529
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:51,960
and if we put a piece of tin foil right

530
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,918
here and I put an infrared gun on it it

531
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,798
wouldn't tell us hardly anything about

532
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
the temperature of the tin foil it would

533
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,798
tell us the temperature of the people in

534
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,278
the class because it's reflecting all

535
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:07,558
the people in here so this is a tiny

536
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:11,519
number but when we get into rigorous

537
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:13,720
analysis of energy balance this 4%

538
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,798
matters and in a field it's just

539
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:21,120
reflected back into space but depending

540
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:22,639
on the situation it can get reabsorbed

541
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,278
somewhere

542
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,080
so does it do with

543
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,440
it if it's reflected

544
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:36,240
it so what does it do with the 4% if

545
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:40,399
it's reflected nothing the 96% it this

546
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,399
96% becomes heat it it's thermal

547
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:47,199
radiation and it makes the object get

548
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:51,278
hotter until it reaches a new

549
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:54,600
equilibrium it it

550
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:58,960
uh it it's it it's converted to heat

551
00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:02,798
can't utilize it no it can't utilize it

552
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,558
um so it this is a as we said the other

553
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,440
day this is a big reason leaves are warm

554
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:10,798
but of course the good news is they can

555
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,919
also by radiation get rid of it too but

556
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,798
it's uh it's it's highly absorbed but

557
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,440
not not completely

558
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:20,480
100%

559
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,399
so this little example here about

560
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,000
emissivity and absorption of of

561
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:31,959
reflection leads

562
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,278
to the use of some instruments to uh

563
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,880
measure

564
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,440
radiation and the place that I have

565
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,919
found that's the most interesting about

566
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,080
this is in

567
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:51,440
buildings all buildings built in the

568
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:52,759
last 10 to 15 years have low E glass and

569
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,360
if you ever dealt with the building

570
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,480
you've heard of low E glass have you

571
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:00,119
heard of that Boston right so what's low

572
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,640
E glass it's all the rage oh yes we're

573
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:06,239
putting low E glass that is low

574
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,880
emissivity glass the glass looks like

575
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,480
tin foil for long wave

576
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,480
radiation now exactly the physics of how

577
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,399
they're doing that I'm a little fuzzy on

578
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,319
because we could certainly put tin foil

579
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:19,918
up and it would be very effective but

580
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,158
this glass right here this is a new

581
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,000
building this has lowy glass I've never

582
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,960
tested it

583
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,200
but here is let to do some research

584
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,759
right right now about the emissivity of

585
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,919
the glass so here's a little cheap

586
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:40,480
infrared gun and I we got several around

587
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:43,000
here and I've bought lots of these um

588
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,159
and you can get these things for under

589
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,679
$25 and it it gives you the surface

590
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,519
temperature in either Celsius or

591
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:56,159
Fahrenheit so um and and they're

592
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:58,720
remarkably accurate for what they cost

593
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,679
so let's see if I can get this in

594
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,159
Celsius so we understand the number so

595
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:07,798
let's do a test right here I'm getting

596
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,000
and I can't see this I'm getting 32

597
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:13,000
Celsius for this uh

598
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,679
glass and that's probably the

599
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,119
temperature of the ceiling up here in

600
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,080
this room um although the glass is

601
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:26,518
pretty warm because the Sun's shining on

602
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:28,439
it 3% of the signal if if this was low

603
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,919
that low E this is probably not the same

604
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,880
as tin foil the emissivity might be

605
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,000
let's say it's 10% the temperature I'm

606
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,519
measuring is 10% of the true surface

607
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,440
temperature and 90% of the ceiling so

608
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,240
it's warmer than than the ceiling but

609
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,440
it's certainly not the temperature of

610
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,038
that glass now most of the things in

611
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,679
here are I mean we could do it on I

612
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:56,038
don't know if this is lowy glass because

613
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,159
it's not an exterior wall but if if we

614
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:01,599
did it on this you can see this has a

615
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:07,080
little uh red LED so you can tell where

616
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:09,599
you're pointing um but if that was cold

617
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,439
and and this was warm it would reflect

618
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,398
and it' tell us the temperature in here

619
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:20,600
that's the concept of low

620
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:24,119
E and help me try and attempt to take

621
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:26,079
this one step farther one thing I know

622
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:28,278
for sure as soon as anybody learns the

623
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,240
principles of these stuff they want own

624
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,880
a lot of instruments to measure it cuz

625
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,200
then they understand what's going on so

626
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,360
this

627
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,919
is

628
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:43,278
a thermal imaging camera now these

629
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,799
things are 25 bucks and you can the more

630
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,319
accurate Ones cost few hundred dollars

631
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:51,079
but this thermal imaging camera these

632
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:51,079
have come down fast

633
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,798
and, bucks something like that for this

634
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,679
I mean they used to be a lot more than n

635
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,879
so now let's see if we can point now I

636
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,240
don't know if the camera can get this

637
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,480
but we point at this

638
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:12,480
window and it's telling us the glass is

639
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,639
warmer than the wall but mostly the

640
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,200
glass is it's reflecting the long wave

641
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:22,359
Off the Wall see your other gun oh yeah

642
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm going to help your demo excellent

643
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,959
terrific oh you're going to get

644
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:32,240
a we're gonna we're going to test some

645
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:34,639
lowy anyway here you can see me in this

646
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,399
um what parts of me are hotter than

647
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:41,359
others um these are really useful for

648
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:44,319
refined measurements of different

649
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,798
temperatures they the absolute accuracy

650
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:50,119
of these is not the greatest but the

651
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:52,879
relative accuracy is really impressive

652
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,599
you can see Tiny changes in uh

653
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,559
temperature if I get out of the

654
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:02,480
way um we can start to see the windows

655
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:04,678
in this the board's much

656
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,000
cooler

657
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,440
um I could pass this around and you can

658
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,679
look through it a bit I just I just

659
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,880
charged it up so I hopefully it's got

660
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,840
enough charge to last for a little bit

661
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,919
but this if you spend a few minutes with

662
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:23,439
this pointing it at things it really

663
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:27,919
drives home the principles of longwave

664
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,759
radiation and the value of using

665
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,080
longwave emissivity to get temperature

666
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,638
of

667
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:40,079
things so I have one more demonstration

668
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:41,240
of uh low E glass I went down to

669
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,079
Bennett's

670
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,720
Glass and I said don't you guys have a

671
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:49,278
demo of this that helps people

672
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,159
understand low E and they got all

673
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,278
excited and they said yeah yeah yeah we

674
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:55,240
can order

675
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:58,359
one so this

676
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,038
is for people selling

677
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:06,240
lowy glass this side right here is

678
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:10,359
ordinary glass and this side over here

679
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,359
is low E glass and like I

680
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:17,399
said 15 years ago there was just only

681
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,639
primitive low E glass now I think it's

682
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,959
almost cold I think everyone has to use

683
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:23,319
low E because it keeps the heat in

684
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,558
you're not going to lose heat by

685
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:27,839
radiation and it works both ways the

686
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:29,759
cold radiation outside it doesn't

687
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,158
radiate inside anymore the cold is

688
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,839
reflected on the

689
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:37,320
outside so now let's start our

690
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:41,759
experiment got a

691
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:44,839
light and these little radiometers spin

692
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:47,200
in proportion to how much radiation is

693
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:50,879
hitting them

694
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,720
and you can see that the ordinary glass

695
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,679
is making this spin more than the low

696
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:02,319
eag oh can this see it too yeah yeah

697
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,840
so there's the principle of these are

698
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,599
real cool you put them in the window and

699
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,639
they spin like crazy so let's this

700
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,519
actually works pretty

701
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,800
good this is for people that really just

702
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,960
want to see a demo they don't understand

703
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,159
the physics they just want to see a demo

704
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,519
and the ordinary glass makes that spin

705
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:28,800
more thank you

706
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:30,480
so how would you calibrate one of these

707
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,839
you can

708
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,838
take this is called a lesli cube but

709
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:40,799
it's a cube full of water and a cone

710
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:43,199
inside painted as black as we can get it

711
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,839
special flat black paint so that

712
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:50,158
emissivity gets very 99 something for

713
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:52,159
the emissivity and if it's a cone shaped

714
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,159
the long wave bounces back and forth

715
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,119
sideways so the emissivity gets even

716
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,160
higher because it's a cone shape so my

717
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:05,519
assistant has filled this with hot

718
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:09,239
water and now we could put this right

719
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:11,519
here what are we saying it's I think it

720
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,519
holds

721
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:18,358
it 80

722
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:21,920
5050 MH now I want to get

723
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:24,279
close let's see if we

724
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,400
can what are we getting

725
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,200
there yeah okay now point at the silver

726
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,559
side

727
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:34,919
yep good so now let's go over

728
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:38,480
here what do we get

729
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,920
there 31 it's it's emissivity this is a

730
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,800
silver side it's not emitting the heat I

731
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,838
touch it and it feels hot and and they P

732
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,200
they're exactly the same temperature but

733
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:53,199
because this is Hut emissivity it gives

734
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:55,118
us a bigger number you can use these in

735
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:58,078
an instrument you can use these to

736
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,640
determine the field of view because

737
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,160
these all these instruments have a

738
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:05,759
cone-shaped field of view and you would

739
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:08,000
like to think that this little red dot

740
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,839
I'm only getting that red dot but it's

741
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,480
in fact averaging this one's probably

742
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,039
averaging a 2 or 3 m squared area up

743
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,199
there CU it's low cost if you want to

744
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,318
get just the Red Dot you got to pay more

745
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,480
for a more precise

746
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:25,800
instrument

747
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,960
um then you can take these and if I do

748
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,800
this and it's got a high temperature and

749
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,240
I start to move it back away quite

750
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,160
quickly it'll start to see the edges and

751
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:38,838
it's no longer measuring just that black

752
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:41,159
cone cuz it's averaging the cone plus

753
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:42,838
this and the higher some of the higher

754
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,920
quality instruments you can go far away

755
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:46,480
and it'll still just see the cone but

756
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,920
that's one of the reasons you pay more

757
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,000
for higher end instruments and you can

758
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,960
buy cheap ones like this plus these work

759
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,920
pretty good if the temperatures are all

760
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,960
within 5° C of the instrument but if you

761
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,039
try to measure a hot surface with this

762
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,519
they're just not very accurate so that's

763
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,599
another problem with with radiometers is

764
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,639
they always measure the delta T because

765
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,838
there's always an exchange of radiation

766
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,000
between the instrument and the surface

767
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:16,159
and it it measures says this is my

768
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,239
temperature that surface is 5° warmer so

769
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,118
it adds the two numbers

770
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:27,358
together so this

771
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:28,640
is emissivity on uh uh principles of it

772
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,440
and

773
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:34,440
and fortunately glass helps you to see

774
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,200
this we we could do all kinds of things

775
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:42,119
with tin foil in here too showing how it

776
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:43,838
reflects the radiation like a mirror and

777
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,000
shows the power and the importance of

778
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:46,000
the

779
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:59,000
emissivity two simple equations or laws

780
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:59,000
that relate to radiation that are

781
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:09,159
important one is Wan's law this is It's

782
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:14,119
pronounced wans this is a German

783
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:16,039
guy many years ago he's looking at the

784
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,800
relationship between longwave and

785
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:22,480
shortwave

786
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:25,599
radiation and he says as objects get

787
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,599
hotter they radiate at shorter

788
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,880
wavelengths cuz this is showing us a

789
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,480
dichotomy of short and long but wait a

790
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:40,680
minute isn't there stuff here in the

791
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:44,760
middle yes there could be so we's law

792
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:47,828
says now let's let's erase

793
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,829
[Music]

794
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,199
this the maximum wavelength and in this

795
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,520
case this would be this point right here

796
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:08,078
maximum equals no I'm going to be

797
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:11,318
simpler it's proportional to one over

798
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,318
temperature real simple inversely

799
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,960
proportional to

800
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:19,719
temperature so as the temperature of an

801
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,240
object gets hotter it radiates at

802
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:26,039
shorter and shorter wavelengths so this

803
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:30,799
is low temperature objects out

804
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:34,920
here this is the sun right here and the

805
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,240
peak number from the Sun is

806
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,920
550 I'm going to put nanometers or

807
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,639
micrometers that's pretty you could look

808
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,800
at the yellow magnet that's pretty close

809
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,799
to that Peak

810
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:51,719
wavelength yep thank

811
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:55,079
you now that I switched to micrometers

812
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:58,480
0.55 now let's put some numbers in this

813
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:00,880
and and and solve it and so now after we

814
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,960
get this the concept here now if we do

815
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,960
equal

816
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,720
sign first of all this is temperature in

817
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,519
Kelvin not in Celsius and this is the

818
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:14,318
maximum wavelength

819
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:18,559
in

820
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:22,440
micrometers so now we have units but

821
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:27,759
it's not one over this this is a

822
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,760
constant and this constant is 28

823
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:35,358
97 so there's the entire wngs

824
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,598
law roughly

825
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:40,559
3,000 divided by the temperature and

826
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,880
Kelvin of the object will give us the

827
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,880
peak

828
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:50,279
wavelength so if the

829
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:52,239
Sun is radiating at 0.5

830
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,880
micrometers now we're going to do some

831
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:58,078
math to make this

832
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,079
simple 0.5 micrometers

833
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,920
how hot is the

834
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,160
sun well we'll rearrange we's law

835
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,440
temperature and

836
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,799
Kelvin and I'm going to put

837
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:17,559
some we're going to round that to

838
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,560
300 and this is 0.5 micromet

839
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:25,239
rounding the sun is 6,000

840
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,960
Kelvin rounding to make the math easy

841
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,838
and that's pretty hot there we don't

842
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,280
have anything on the earth that's that

843
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:35,759
hot which is why this short wave is

844
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,440
coming from the sun because it has to be

845
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,359
that hot what if

846
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,200
we put

847
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:47,199
about the inside of a oven you're going

848
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,879
to bake the

849
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:53,399
turkey let's let's go

850
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,880
to

851
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,880
uh let's take this

852
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,720
off and now now we're going to say

853
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,000
maximum wavelength 3,000 now we're going

854
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:08,519
to put temperature in here and you bake

855
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,440
a turkey it's 400° or a pizza at 400°

856
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,440
that's roughly 200 Kelvin

857
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:21,800
so the inside of an oven might be 273

858
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:24,358
plus a couple hundred 500 Kelvin to make

859
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:28,359
this math easy

860
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:28,358
so six

861
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,280
um now I got a mistake in here somewhere

862
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,239
this is coming out to

863
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,480
six micrometers yeah no it's not a

864
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:49,919
mistake so this is

865
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:53,519
0.5 and a hot oven is out

866
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,480
here at at uh the these are nanometers

867
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,759
so this is 8 micrometers so hot oven is

868
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,760
over

869
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:07,558
here 6

870
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:09,639
micrometers so this is why terrestrial

871
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,400
objects all radiate out in here

872
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:13,480
depending on their temperature and even

873
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,079
a hot oven doesn't get us to shortwave

874
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,159
radiation it's still longwave these are

875
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:23,119
all described by we's

876
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:26,118
law and there's another application of

877
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,119
this

878
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,240
here is

879
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:38,480
a

880
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:38,479
graph of doing this for a couple of

881
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:45,719
temperatures

882
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:48,440
so here's 5,500 Kelvin and as this gets

883
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:51,919
cooler it shifts out here to longer

884
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,280
wavelengths not by much but it shifts so

885
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,599
you see two things happening remember

886
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,720
Stefan boltzman equation the total

887
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,240
radiation is determined by the

888
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:04,118
temperature and as the temperature gets

889
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:07,598
cooler the area under this curve gets

890
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:09,599
less and as it gets hotter it becomes

891
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,559
more

892
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,160
blue and the more the hotter the object

893
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,400
the more blue the cooler the object the

894
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:23,598
more orange and

895
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:26,160
red so we use Wings law .1% of the

896
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,079
people in the world know this to

897
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:33,239
determine color temperatures of lights

898
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:37,680
and all kinds of things we say and film

899
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:40,879
this is a 4,000 Kelvin film and this

900
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:43,318
light has is some Kelvin temperature

901
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,920
none of them are smooth curves it's just

902
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:48,279
an an effective way to say the color

903
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,200
temperature of objects we talk about

904
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,160
color temperature but it's from wngs law

905
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,358
the bigger the number the more blue the

906
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:58,759
output blue lights have you could say um

907
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:02,039
cool white for fluorescent which is blue

908
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,920
is might be a 6,000 Kelvin light and a

909
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,880
warm white fluorescent which is more

910
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,920
orange might be a 3,000 Kelvin light and

911
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:15,039
that all comes from wngs law and there

912
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:17,639
shift from the maximum wavelength

913
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,838
so when you see those color temperatures

914
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,279
and you think through this and anytime

915
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,159
it's inversely

916
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,480
proportional you have to shift your

917
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:28,960
thinking a little um hot hot objects are

918
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,960
more blue

919
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:34,240
Plank's

920
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:38,319
equation I don't have my picture of

921
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:41,479
plank here um but he's one of the top 25

922
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:44,039
scientists of all time um and this

923
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,719
picture he has a tie on and little tiny

924
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:49,119
glasses and he just makes it look like

925
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,239
he was a very organized guy and he was

926
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,760
he he lived to be 82 years old which is

927
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:58,919
a real accomplishment in the in the

928
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,920
1800s when he lived so

929
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,720
we

930
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:09,400
have this refrigerator

931
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:12,519
magnet which everybody's uh got on their

932
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,519
filing cabinet

933
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:19,480
now and we're showing this both

934
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,358
in

935
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,440
photons and

936
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:27,639
energy and the shape of the

937
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,720
curve and the photon flux is all the

938
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:31,118
physiologists that are modeling and

939
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:33,838
predicting

940
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,280
photosynthesis and the energy flux is

941
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,799
all the meteorologist that are modeling

942
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,960
temperature and the differences in

943
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,880
temperature they're obviously both

944
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,079
important and they're different

945
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,318
shapes so is there any way to go back

946
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:52,480
and forth

947
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:55,159
between Jewels this is per meter squ per

948
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,599
second per nanometer this is me squ per

949
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:59,480
second nanomer is there any way to go

950
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:00,599
back and forth between jewels and moles

951
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,960
of

952
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:10,079
photons and the answer is thanks to Mox

953
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,960
plon and what I do with my black marker

954
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,839
here it

955
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,720
is thanks to MOX plon I'm going to erase

956
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:21,960
some of this to give give plon lots of

957
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:27,679
room for his for his

958
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,679
equation another very simple equation

959
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:32,599
energy per

960
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,480
photon is proportional

961
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,519
to one over the wavelength real similar

962
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,838
to this only this is temperature and

963
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,239
quality of the

964
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:57,759
light and this is helping us go back

965
00:47:54,239 --> 00:48:01,719
allowing us to go back and forth between

966
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:05,440
Jewels or watts of energy and

967
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:08,558
photons so energy drives thermal

968
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,880
reactions and photons drive a whole

969
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:15,000
another set of reactions like

970
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,400
photosynthesis we know that one Photon

971
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,838
excites one

972
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,200
electron that's that's called the Stark

973
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:22,838
Einstein

974
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:25,000
law and that's what causes

975
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:27,318
photosynthesis that is exactly what

976
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,039
causes electricity in a solar

977
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:34,079
photovoltaic cell one Photon excites one

978
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,239
electron and we get electricity those

979
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,480
solar voltaic cells aren't running off a

980
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,039
thermal radiation they need shortwave

981
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,800
radiation and we need to count photons

982
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,639
to determine

983
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,760
electricity so we get Plank's equation

984
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:55,039
inversely proportional to wavelength

985
00:48:49,760 --> 00:49:00,720
now if we change this to

986
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:04,079
equals this one becomes H and

987
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:07,039
C and C is the speed of

988
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,119
light H is Plank's

989
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,279
constant and I don't have these two

990
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,440
numbers memorized but it's but they're

991
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,680
big

992
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:20,440
numbers

993
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:24,598
and this is Jewels per photon here

994
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:27,000
um if we put numbers in this and this is

995
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:30,079
how I remember it cuz it's like a a lot

996
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
of things you work it out for one value

997
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:35,599
and then you can rate forever racial

998
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,760
things to that value but if we

999
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,559
do

1000
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,480
HC over

1001
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,519
550

1002
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,159
nanometers now this is right in the

1003
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:52,039
middle between 400 and 700 550 is the

1004
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:54,759
average wavelength of light from the sun

1005
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:57,000
it's green light it's average light

1006
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,559
right in the middle

1007
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,079
this comes out to

1008
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,359
be

1009
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:07,079
2117

1010
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,078
kles per mole of

1011
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:14,719
photons putting these numbers in I'll

1012
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,240
work out a page with the step-by-step

1013
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,919
math worked out on this and all the

1014
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:22,279
numbers in it but there's a

1015
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,440
relationship so now if you say what

1016
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,839
would the energy what would this number

1017
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:33,519
be at 600 well you can easily ratio this

1018
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:38,119
and you get this relationship here

1019
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:41,280
um this so so Plank's equation allows us

1020
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:44,880
to go back and forth between energy and

1021
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:49,640
moles and you can keep going with this

1022
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:52,559
equ like we have here to 800 900 1,000

1023
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:55,679
here's the photon flux these

1024
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,160
photons are longer associated with

1025
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,358
longer wavelength

1026
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:02,159
they have less

1027
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:05,119
energy I like to think of the UV photons

1028
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:08,960
are really high energy you know if this

1029
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:12,760
was 3155 nanm this thing would be let me

1030
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:17,358
see if we took half of this

1031
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,359
275 this would be over 400 Kil 400 KJ

1032
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,798
per mole that's ultraviolet light that's

1033
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:24,279
high energy photons which is why

1034
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:26,000
ultraviolet photons are so degrading to

1035
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,559
everything they're super high energy

1036
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,119
they're just I don't know they're like

1037
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,720
third graders they just got a lot of

1038
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,798
energy then you get out here to 900 and

1039
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,679
it's the people with canes and there's

1040
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:40,280
low energy there's still one person but

1041
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:44,318
they're low energy

1042
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:47,559
so these photons past 700 no longer have

1043
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:50,679
enough energy to excite electrons for

1044
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:51,880
photosynthesis so we don't count them um

1045
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:55,000
and down

1046
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,000
here they're too high of energy for

1047
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,400
photosynthesis they're they're damaging

1048
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,280
there's not that much down here either

1049
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,119
so it's got to be just in this right

1050
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,079
range

1051
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,559
um but it leads to the shapes of these

1052
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,519
curves

1053
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:14,920
incidentally solar

1054
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:18,039
photovoltaics are in the

1055
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,920
laboratory similar efficiency to

1056
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:24,279
photosynthesis and a good solar voltaics

1057
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:27,440
and now you get up 30 40% efficiency

1058
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,720
photosynthesis can be 30 40% too in the

1059
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,519
lab and they're both going off of one

1060
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:35,439
Photon excites one

1061
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:38,798
electron one makes carbohydrates and the

1062
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,760
other one makes electricity solar panels

1063
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:45,079
can use these photons they they keep

1064
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,640
absorbing out to a, even

1065
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:51,119
1100 out here so solar panels can use

1066
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:54,118
some of this longer wave radiation

1067
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,559
photosynthesis can't and it's generally

1068
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,838
why solar photovoltaics are more

1069
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,240
efficient in photosynthesis they can

1070
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:02,558
capture that bar you said something that

1071
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:05,078
so

1072
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:08,240
sunlight majority of sunlight or tends

1073
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:10,880
towards the green Spectrum PL evolve not

1074
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:10,879
using the

1075
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:16,480
most yes though the question is how come

1076
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,480
plants are green if there's so much

1077
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:24,838
green light wouldn't they want to

1078
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:28,559
capture that two answers one it's it's

1079
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:31,880
not this is a fairly curve so it's it's

1080
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,760
not U that much different green

1081
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,160
light but still why don't they absorb

1082
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,440
everything why do they have a dip at all

1083
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:41,118
in green

1084
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,798
light and they could if they could

1085
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,280
capture that green light too they'd be

1086
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:48,000
more efficient so you could say well

1087
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,480
chlorophyll just doesn't absorb green

1088
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,880
light that molecule well then it's a bad

1089
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,000
molecule we should have got something

1090
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:57,000
else and the way I like to think of it

1091
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
is

1092
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,760
animals came along and they eat

1093
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,079
plants and our eyes can see green light

1094
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:10,960
better than any other wavelength if we

1095
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:15,119
drew our eyes on here I can put it on

1096
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:18,720
here uh green put around here in black

1097
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,400
blue here's our eyes this is a little

1098
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:23,798
thing our eyes look like that we see

1099
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,160
green really well we don't see blues and

1100
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:28,480
reds very well so animals of evolved to

1101
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:31,159
be able to see

1102
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,559
plants they plants reflected the green

1103
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:37,118
light and the animals that that could

1104
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:40,000
see that green light got found the

1105
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,838
plants better and got more food and I

1106
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,159
don't know I never heard anyone else say

1107
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,159
that but that's a good sounding

1108
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,318
hypothesis it's interesting the

1109
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:53,118
wavelengths of light reflected by plants

1110
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:55,480
are the ones that we see the best and

1111
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:58,760
so but you could also ask couldn't we

1112
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,559
invent a better molecule for plants that

1113
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,119
that captured all this

1114
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,680
and now we know there's lots of pigments

1115
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,880
in Plants besides chlorophyll if you

1116
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,838
look at older plant physiology textbooks

1117
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,079
they say well plants don't absorb much

1118
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,239
green light look at

1119
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,240
chlorophyll in

1120
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:19,000
fact let me answer that let's see let's

1121
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:21,239
put this right here we got this done

1122
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,239
with

1123
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:28,318
this here's our 400 to 700 blown up big

1124
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:34,358
if you look at a plant physiology

1125
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:38,038
textbook

1126
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:40,440
chlorophyll looks like that it absorbs

1127
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:43,200
Blues there's chlorophyll A and B but

1128
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,639
they're they look like this they absorb

1129
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,399
blues and reds but the chlorophyll

1130
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:50,358
hardly absorbs any

1131
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,119
green and all the plant physiology text

1132
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:54,078
book said well chlorophyll doesn't

1133
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,720
absorb much green so guess what when we

1134
00:55:54,079 --> 00:56:00,160
invented efficient LEDs that were blues

1135
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:02,719
and reds a whole bunch of people going

1136
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:04,759
wow these are perfect for plants cuz

1137
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,358
they match the absorption of chlorophyll

1138
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,760
there were no there still are no

1139
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,358
efficient green LEDs the ones green we

1140
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,799
have them but they're not efficient at

1141
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,920
all so they said the LEDs are perfect

1142
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:17,920
for plants they match the absorption of

1143
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,680
chlorophyll and then we found out they

1144
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,680
really don't work very well through 10

1145
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:26,879
20 years of work and way how come well

1146
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:29,598
now we know and if you take a modern

1147
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:32,880
plant physiology textbook they have

1148
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:35,720
Curves in here like this and like this

1149
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,400
and they're all colors they're I'm out

1150
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:40,480
of colors but you get the idea there's a

1151
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,760
whole bunch of Curves in those now and

1152
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,639
they say multiple pigments absorb all

1153
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:49,440
the light um there's there's a new

1154
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:51,879
pigment psychoan is discovered in

1155
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,240
algae I don't know about discovered it

1156
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,680
was clarified in algae just a few years

1157
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:59,598
ago it's its peak absorptions in green

1158
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:01,199
light so there's the potential to

1159
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,079
genetically engineered to put more

1160
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,038
psychoan in plants and then they will

1161
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:06,880
get that green light they won't look

1162
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:10,119
green anymore I guess they'll look I

1163
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,240
don't know black but so it's that's a

1164
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:13,760
long answer to that to an interesting

1165
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,759
question how come they don't get

1166
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:20,599
pigments to capture every spec of it and

1167
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,480
what I would like to see is pigments so

1168
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:24,640
they could use some of this there's a

1169
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,400
lot of energy right in here and if we

1170
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:30,838
could just get pigments to get to 800

1171
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:34,440
wow we could feed the world but we don't

1172
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:36,960
have them they chlorophyll ends at 700

1173
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,760
and then nothing yes they would absorb

1174
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,440
more heat too but will Precision

1175
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:46,240
irrigate and save water and get more

1176
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:50,000
yield um so there's why do pigments do

1177
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:52,639
what they do how do they evolve um they

1178
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,400
interesting questions Damon so is the

1179
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,798
limiting factor on plant growth

1180
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,798
capturing radi D

1181
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:05,559
photosynthesis so the question is is the

1182
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:08,199
limiting factor absorbing radiation for

1183
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:10,240
yield and then if you got additional

1184
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:12,598
pigments you'd be able to grow more but

1185
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:16,078
I don't know if

1186
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:19,838
that's yes it is the limiting factor if

1187
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:22,359
if if we when you plant in the spring we

1188
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:25,318
got beautiful light it's it's May and

1189
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:27,000
early June there's a lot of light oh 90%

1190
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,519
of it's wasted because it hits the

1191
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,480
ground and here's the little nice green

1192
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:35,759
plants but the 90% is wasted finally

1193
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,719
they fill in and yield takes off um so

1194
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,799
there's an example of absorbed radiation

1195
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:43,838
but what we're talking about here is

1196
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:48,119
after it fills in couldn't we get

1197
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:50,558
it I mean here's one answer to to the

1198
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:53,400
question kind of a smartass answer what

1199
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,559
do you mean they already absorb 95% and

1200
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:59,960
you're complaining couldn't we get this

1201
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:03,920
to 9 8 and yeah that would be a 3% and

1202
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,920
every little bit helps

1203
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:10,798
so

1204
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,039
okay I'm going to stop here and we'll

1205
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:16,318
take a

1206
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:19,920
break this is the end of radiation

1207
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:24,000
lectures when we come back

1208
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,599
in we will in a few minutes we will talk

1209
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,920
about transpiration

1210
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:29,720
all of this is we're going to get

1211
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,318
transpiration by

1212
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:33,239
subtraction well can't we just measure

1213
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,519
it

1214
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:42,199
directly and the answer is sort

1215
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:42,199
of so let's take a break
