00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:04,838
Hello, my name is Schuyler Smith, and I do technical sales and support here at Apogee

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:05,839
instruments.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,550
And today we're going to talk about the Quickstart guide for the AT-100 µCache with our IRR

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,689
sensors — our infrared radiometers — that are good for measuring surface temperatures.

5
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:23,820
So in this video, we're going to cover where to download the app from, how to connect the

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,689
unit, configuring your sensor, and then how to set up logging, and then how to get those

7
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,140
logged values off of your sensor.

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,490
So first off, this is where you will find the app.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,379
It's available in the Google Play Store and then the iOS App Store.

10
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:47,149
You'll just type in Apogee Connect, and that is the icon you're looking for.

11
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:53,239
And there's some screenshots that we're going to be going through later on the demonstration.

12
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:59,669
This here is the Quickstart Guide on how to connect it to it and how to add it.

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,429
We're going to go through each one of these steps individually.

14
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,659
This is here for a reference.

15
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,079
You can pause the video as needed.

16
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,840
This next one is the Quickstart Guide to begin logging — how to set up the logging intervals.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,329
And again you can pause here.

18
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,689
And then this is the Quickstart Guide to collecting the logs.

19
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,120
So after you've set it up for logging and then you go back to it, how do you get those

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,450
logs off so you can view them on your phone?

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,969
And so those are the steps there.

22
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:36,640
And we're going to go through each one of these.

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,939
Okay so this is an iOS version of it, and this is what it's going to look like when

24
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:41,939
you first come in.

25
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,170
It’s blank, okay.

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,200
And that has add device right there.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,350
We have our unit µCache here.

28
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,519
We have our IR sensor.

29
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,719
Now, I actually already have one added on.

30
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,109
So that's what it’d look like if you had one added and it’s not connected.

31
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,140
But if you don’t have one at all, then this is what it’s going to look like where it's

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
blank.

33
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,159
So we are going to go ahead and add it.

34
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,199
And the way we do this is we're going to push the green button here until it blinks blue.

35
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,500
So now it's blinking blue.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,490
Now the app is not looking for it yet, so we have to hit the “+” button.

37
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,310
So we hit the “+” button right there.

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,300
Okay and it comes up and it says “uc1074” and we can look back here and see that is

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,080
the correct serial number.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,140
So just for convenience I'm going to add this quick platform there.

41
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,219
And now we'll go ahead and add it.

42
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:40,359
Alright and we see it comes up as an SP-110, which is incorrect.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,190
We know this is a SI-121, and we can look at our cal sheet that came with the unit to

44
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:49,639
know which model we're connecting, which one we had bought.

45
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:59,059
So we choose model, but actually it just is any — whether it's an SI-111, 121, 131,

46
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,650
or 1H1.

47
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,390
We just do the SI-1XX.

48
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,979
So we click there.

49
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:11,199
And now it's asking us for the M coefficients and the B coefficient, which we can see over

50
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,189
here on our sheet this top row and this bottom row.

51
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:18,490
And it really... as you can see these are the same.

52
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,860
They're just written in different multiples of each other.

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,160
So we'll go ahead and just do this.

54
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,599
CRBasic model.

55
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:34,539
So for the C2 it says we need... so we'll hit clear... and then we'll do 2-0-1-0-1-5.

56
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:54,099
C1 we hit clear 1-9-3-2-4-7-0-0.

57
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,370
Next one C0.

58
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:06,240
Clear that out, and this is 3-1-2-5-1-6-0-0-0-0.

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,730
Come down here to C2.

60
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:08,969
Clear that out.

61
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,460
Actually the B coefficients of C2.

62
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,790
So we have 1-6-8-9-.7.

63
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:25,259
C1, clear that out, 1-6-2-9-0-6.

64
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,529
And then right here we'll hit clear.

65
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:28,829
Now we need a negative.

66
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:38,560
So on iOS I just hit the negative button right there and then 1-8-6-8-3-7-0.

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,959
Then I hit done.

68
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:46,489
Now if I want to give it a name as well, and we can just name it right now, let's just

69
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,360
name it, you know, “desk.”

70
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,160
Okay just so we know which one we're talking about.

71
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,630
And then we can add it.

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,779
Okay so we see that it's at a desk, and we see that it's giving us some values right

73
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,839
here.

74
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,779
So let's go into it... and there we go.

75
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:16,339
So now before when it said 24.1 that means I had not loaded the calibration coefficients,

76
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,339
but now it has.

77
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:23,019
And if we went back out to that screen, now it's finally updated saying okay we're calculating

78
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:26,099
those values based off what you input.

79
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,400
So let's go into it.

80
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,918
So this is our home screen okay.

81
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,948
It says logs available for collection 2300.

82
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,420
Now in our case we don't believe that.

83
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,629
That must've been previous, so we'll clear that out.

84
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,939
That's fine.

85
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,219
Clear that to zero.

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,389
Now down here these values will not update until we get logged data in here.

87
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,960
So you can tell that we don't have any logged data saved to the app to look at, so that

88
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,728
is why it says January 1, 1970.

89
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:05,279
Let's go to live meter mode first.

90
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,849
So we go to live meter mode.

91
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,970
Now we can get our dynamic graph here that is changing okay.

92
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:19,000
And based on this, again we're just in here in our studio, and we can see that our temperature

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,569
and our surface temperature are about the same.

94
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:27,459
Now if I put my hand in front of the unit here, so now we're measuring my outside temperature

95
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:33,899
of my hand, we can see that it's somewhere around 27 to 28 degrees Celsius.

96
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,479
And we can change that.

97
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,379
And the graph is going to change accordingly.

98
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,341
And you can see the sensor body is nearly identical.

99
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,550
I mean that's very small changes.

100
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,579
But obviously just being closer to that did increase that sensor body temperature a little

101
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,609
bit as well.

102
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,199
Now the important thing about these graphs are it is not logging.

103
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,240
This is just live data right now since we came in and pushed live.

104
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,509
If I go out of this and I go back here and then I go back to live meter it has reset

105
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,009
okay, and so now it is logging again just giving us our spot measurements at our current

106
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,169
location.

107
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:19,839
And again it will just dynamically change with that, and we can see those graphs.

108
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,129
Now if we want to record individual points, this comes down here, and we just hit record

109
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:26,290
current value.

110
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,590
Okay so I did a time date and then it gave us our surface temperature and then it gives

111
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,459
us our sensor body temperature.

112
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:37,709
And then if we want to record value here, we can see that surface temperature sensor

113
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:41,099
body temperature, and we just hit record in values.

114
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,570
Now if we want to export data we hit export.

115
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,459
It comes up with the line item of each one.

116
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,750
And then we just hit that familiar button up there, which is the share button, which

117
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,060
will allow us to just attach that straight to an email and email that to ourselves.

118
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,360
So this is live meter mode.

119
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,639
Perfect to verify that our coefficients are in and perfect to see spot measurements.

120
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:11,709
Okay so now currently it is updating that average — averaging every second.

121
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,069
Let's say we wanted to go 5 seconds.

122
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,829
So if we go back to home here, and then we click on settings.

123
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:21,779
And then we're gonna go through each one of these settings.

124
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,159
But first let's look at live data averaging, which is about the third one down here on

125
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,139
settings as we scroll down.

126
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,610
And this is averaging samples over one second.

127
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,009
So if we move this over to 5, and it can go as high as 30 seconds.

128
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:42,209
Okay so we go to 5 okay, and then we come back here to live meter.

129
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:50,399
So now it's doing 5-second averaging to get all the way up there to that 28.

130
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,149
So it was increasing because it was still doing, still takes the 5 seconds averaging

131
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,889
before it got up there to the 28.

132
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:08,089
And we'll see that slowly fall off as well just based on the 5-second averaging.

133
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,300
All right so that is live meter mode, and again it's giving us those same values that

134
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,789
we'd see in live meter right up here under current reading.

135
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,088
So let's go through settings now.

136
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:23,110
Now just in case you wonder if you entered your coefficients wrong because that was a

137
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,220
lot of numbers, they are always available right here under settings.

138
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,370
So you can pull up your sheet and double-check yourself anytime.

139
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:39,139
Now if for any reason you lose your cal sheet, just email us at techsupport@apogeeinstruments.com

140
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:45,139
and we can email this information over to you and you can re-enter it into your µCache.

141
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,730
So everything looks good there.

142
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,480
Logging enabled is turned off currently.

143
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,220
We'll come back to that and turn that on and set that up in a little while.

144
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,860
We talked about live data averaging.

145
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,289
Here's some points here.

146
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:02,688
The battery level says 100%.

147
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:07,318
This is not very accurate, so do not trust that level.

148
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:12,629
You can email us at tech support if you have any questions about your battery levels.

149
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,259
Okay hardware and firmware version okay.

150
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:18,019
And then match current time.

151
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:24,278
So what you want is you want the time on your phone to match the time on your logger, and

152
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,058
so you just hit match current time and then it goes through and it just makes sure that

153
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:31,139
those two sync up together.

154
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,789
Now down here is update sensor firmware.

155
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:36,578
Always a good idea when it's new to go ahead and click this.

156
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:39,758
Even if you have the latest it's not going to hurt anything.

157
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,259
So right now it says version on device is 5 — can update to version 5.

158
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:47,550
I know you can't see that because it's very light on that screen.

159
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,289
But you'll see that on your own.

160
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:54,480
So if I hit start, then down here you can see that it's going through some things.

161
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,289
It's gone red here.

162
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,379
So it's going through the bootloader.

163
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,209
It's uploading the current version of firmware here.

164
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:06,539
Okay and then it's going to come down here… and completed.

165
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,379
Now you'll notice it's not complete until the start button goes green because that means

166
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,360
it reconnected to it again after it reset itself.

167
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,568
So we are all set on the firmware.

168
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:20,198
So that's your basic rundown on settings.

169
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:24,039
Dark threshold — that doesn't affect IR readings.

170
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,299
And then notify when full — you can click on that so that once those 400,000 data points

171
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:33,219
have been filled and you login and connect to it, it will give you that notice.

172
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,778
So you can turn that on as you as you want.

173
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,588
Now logging enabled.

174
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:43,569
So we want to set this up so that it can log.

175
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:48,299
Now on the QuickStart instructions as we said we recommend 15 minute log times so you can

176
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,109
get your 6-9 month battery life out of the µCache.

177
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,899
If you do less than that then it's going to shorten it.

178
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,839
If you go as short as minutes, then you will reduce the life down to weeks.

179
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,999
If you go to 1 second, it may be 1 week long is all the battery will last on this.

180
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:11,459
So make sure as you're setting up your logging interval and your sampling intervals that

181
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,539
you're aware of that.

182
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:15,259
So again we just have this one set up.

183
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:24,079
I'm going to go out to to 1 minute and I'm going to go logging interval 15 minutes...

184
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:31,099
so get this on 1 minute get this down to 15 minutes.

185
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,699
All right so it's gonna average twelve samples to average and then it's going to log that

186
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:39,409
average every 15 minutes.

187
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:42,240
Okay now until I hit save it is not enabled.

188
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,579
And then once I hit save, it has now saved it and it is now logging internally in here.

189
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,789
Okay so our logging is all set up.

190
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:56,349
So if we come back here, it says zero for collection because it is waiting to do that

191
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,680
every minute.

192
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,979
Okay so then we deploy it, set it up wherever we want, and then let's come back in an hour

193
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,259
or two hours — whatever our plan is — and we want to collect the logs.

194
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:12,298
So we go right here to collect logs.

195
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:16,480
And we want to be on create new because this is the first time we're getting our logs.

196
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,720
Okay and we can set the date... okay… so we can set it.

197
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,239
So let's do June 2020.

198
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,649
Or you can set to the date.

199
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,688
Whatever you want.

200
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:43,149
Start time, okay, so if we set the start time to… okay... set time to the beginning.

201
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,028
And then if we collect logs up to today it will say

202
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:52,850
logs remaining 65,000 because from since this sensor’s been used there are 65,000 logs

203
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,850
on it okay.

204
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,670
So it's going to go through and download each one of those.

205
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,778
Now that's going to take quite a while.

206
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:02,338
And then it will graph it down here below... and then it will graph it down here below,

207
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,339
and you'll be able to see that.

208
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:12,170
Alright so we'll go ahead and we're going to set that one aside, and then we're going

209
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:20,248
to look at this one on how to append logs and what logged data would actually look like.

210
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:27,709
So right here we have it here in front of us, and we can see it's a road temp in the

211
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,958
front.

212
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,599
So what we want to do is we want to connect to it.

213
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,470
So we're going to push the button down until it blinks blue.

214
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,790
Wait for it.

215
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,278
And it said connected right up.

216
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:43,129
So we see right here, we have our two data points here, our target temperature, and our

217
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,859
sensor body temperature.

218
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:46,679
we go into it okay.

219
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:52,480
And it says logs available for collection is one.

220
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,909
But we actually... so if we go to collect logs... now I know that there is actually

221
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:04,358
a week's worth of data on this where we were measuring the temperature of just our walkway

222
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,579
out front here in the summertime.

223
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:09,088
So if I go start date.

224
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,720
And I go to create new.

225
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,850
And I can dataset 5.

226
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,369
So let's just say “studio demo” just to name it something.

227
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:28,989
Okay and then for the start time let's go back a week to Thursday, and then end time

228
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:29,989
today.

229
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:33,600
Okay and then I hit collect logs.

230
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:52,168
Okay I can see that the collect logs... clicked start time... create new… go back a week...

231
00:15:52,168 --> 00:16:11,798
Thursday... let's do midnight...  to today... collect logs…

232
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:24,250
Okay so it is saying that the only data it has is 3 days.

233
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,028
So the data that I was looking for is no longer... was erased off before the presentation.

234
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:34,980
But, nevertheless, we have our data points from the last three days as well as the data

235
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,778
point that it had logged in here.

236
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:41,859
So anytime we want to get new data points, we just hit collect logs, make sure it's on

237
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:45,139
append to existing, and then we will collect logs.

238
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,850
It says there are currently zero available to log.

239
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,949
And then down here we can see our sensor body temperature.

240
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:59,088
And then if we want to export that data, we go to view data, we click here, and then we

241
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,069
can go ahead and get those data points.

242
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:11,079
Alright, well that concludes our Quickstart Guide for the IR sensor with the µCache.
