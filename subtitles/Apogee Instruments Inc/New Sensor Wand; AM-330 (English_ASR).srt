3
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,518
apog instruments would like to introduce

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,839
our redesigned sensor wand and it's

5
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,759
magic okay maybe magic isn't quite the

6
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,840
right word for it but does extend from

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,799
11 to 36 in in seconds the wand is

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,559
easily adjustable simply twist to unlock

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,479
extend and then rotate to lock again

10
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,039
there's no more rods to thread or to

11
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:46,319
connect the wand features a more robust

12
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,558
design than previous versions the grip

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,159
is rubberized to ensure easy operation

14
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,358
the wand is designed to be used both

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,799
above and below water making it ideal

16
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,800
for taking measurements and hard to

17
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:59,679
reach locations like up here like over

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,518
there or even down here the open-ended

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,518
shaft allows for quick draining and easy

20
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,359
cleaning the mounting plate is designed

21
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:08,280
to work flawlessly with all apog

22
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,519
pyrometers and Par sensors so we put it

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,260
like that maybe it is just a little bit

24
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:17,338
Magic
