1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:09,189
So this is going to be different because this is a higher level class than

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:10,000
beginning

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,809
graduate students because most of you have already had exposure to some of

4
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:20,559
this stuff. We will try to solidify the basics and then go into more depth

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,018
as we come up on things.

6
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:28,418
I should introduce myself like I due to all the

7
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:39,039
students.  I'm Bruce Bugbee (and this is more for the video)

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,039
my title is professor of crop physiology.

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:49,090
Somewhere along the line I got much more interested in the physics of plant

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:56,980
growth then the physiology and that means energy and mass transfer into and

11
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:04,088
out of plants, and because of that my laboratory is done well with getting

12
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:10,329
funding because people want to quantify things. Many, many years ago that led

13
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:18,280
to a lot of instruments to rigorously quantify inputs and outputs. What I've

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,120
evolved to now is instrument intensive research on plant growth.

15
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,010
Some students have called this class, in the reviews, some students have called

16
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,120
this class crop physics. "You should just call it crop physics because

17
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,290
that's what it".

18
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,090
That's not strictly correct because there's a lot of biology in the class as

19
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,750
well.

20
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:47,200
What I'm going to focus on in approximately the next eight lectures is

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,670
this outline here, which I've handed out, which focuses on energy balance.

22
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,890
It's the first part of the class, and it's the fundamentals by which we get

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,200
evaporation from surfaces.

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,949
As a point of introduction and before I get way too far into this,

25
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:24,129
I thought it would give you a full copy of the whole class that I teach.

26
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:29,409
You can see we're pruning off these early lectures right here. I teach this

27
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:34,299
winter semesters up here. We're pruning off these this first section up

28
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:44,739
here on energy balance. This is the whole thing. This is also the front

29
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:52,390
page of the textbook I use, which is a bunch of readings of this and I love to

30
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:58,449
put all the key equations right on the front of the book so people can see

31
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,909
those and see what's coming up. Mostly the top half of these things are

32
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:06,909
the ones who are going to focus on in here.

33
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:23,040
The reason we do energy balance analysis in any field is to try

34
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:30,780
and determine that temperature of objects and anytime water is involved

35
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,430
now it gets way more complicated because water evaporates and changes the

36
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,520
temperature of objects, which is why agriculture focuses on energy

37
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,140
balance so much.

38
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:51,209
If we could get a low-cost sensor that could measure the evaporation of water

39
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,210
from a field, it would be a huge breakthrough.

40
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,180
Just put it out there and measure the flux of water, but there isn't any

41
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,280
low cost ways to do that so we do it with modeling and lots of modeling.

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,719
We measure all the parameters around this and what's left is this missing

43
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,939
water and this much water must have evaporated to balance the energy. That's

44
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,829
the most cost-effective way to do it and frankly that's a big reason

45
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,000
instrument companies are in business. They sell instruments to measure

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,500
everything. We can put plants on a lysimeter and weigh them, and that's an

47
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,829
accurate way to get water that evaporates.

48
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:40,649
Lysimeter are really expensive to install. They're expensive to operate,

49
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:48,149
and only people that use those as references. Refrences use lysimeters the rest of us

50
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:54,599
use calculations and and modeling. We use lysimeter as well but only for

51
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,200
reference instruments. We can do things like eddy covariance to get water

52
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,969
transfer and that's expensive and requires knowledgeable

53
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,000
people. It's still an indirect measurement of measuring water vapor.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,649
So we keep coming back to energy balance principles to really understand where

55
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,000
the water is going.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,519
If you type in water use in the world on the internet, you get

57
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,729
lots of things like this.

58
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,810
Agriculture is 70 % of our water in the United States and worldwide.

59
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,560
Its the massive user of water. I gave a TED talk on this a few years

60
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,199
ago, Turning Water Into Food, and the main point than that talk was people aren't

61
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,668
wasting water. The image says farmers are using seventy percent of our water,

62
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,509
they must be just wasting it, running it down into rivers and into the

63
00:05:58,509 --> 00:05:59,529
groundwater.

64
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:08,259
It just takes that much water to grow food. This is one of many graphs of

65
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,459
that. The point is if we could improve water use efficiency in

66
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:21,159
agriculture by 1% it would be more than what you use at home.

67
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,320
Forget putting bricks in your toilet and turn the water off when

68
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,819
you brush your teeth.

69
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,079
Those are just miniscule compared to the amount of water that it takes to grow

70
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,939
our food, which is why it's so imperative to understand that and use every drop as

71
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:42,370
efficiently as we can. Ww call that more crop per drop, that effort.

72
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,680
It takes a lot of instruments to get that analyzed, and it takes a lot of

73
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,189
rigorous and careful

74
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,810
theoretical development to make sure we've got it right because so many cases

75
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,089
are different.

76
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:08,409
People need oxygen to run our respiration and you think what's a

77
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,699
person's water use efficiency. What its our personal water use efficiency?

78
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,220
You calculate how much water do we exhale and how much food we eat. It's the

79
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,620
reverse of plants. People have it easy because there's 21 %

80
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:30,879
oxygen in the air and we don't have to breathe very much and therefore we don't

81
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:40,360
lose much water. Plants have to work on 0.04% CO2 in the

82
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,930
air.

83
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,930
For plants to breathe,

84
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,990
they got to have their stomates wide open and the water diffuses out into the

85
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:57,759
world. I could start this by writing what I think is the most important

86
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,250
equation in the world.

87
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,379
Then you ask people what that is, maybe it's E=MC^2.

88
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:10,180
To me the most important equation in the world is

89
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:27,539
photosynthesis. Note they're subscripts on these C-6 H-12, but this is the basic the

90
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:34,019
simple stochiamitry. The plants in photosynthesis are taking this low

91
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:40,769
energy gas, that we used to put out fires, and turning it into carbohydrate, a

92
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,568
high-energy solid.

93
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:45,838
It's just amazing that they do that!

94
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:55,800
Again if this is a 20.95 % the oxygen and this is 0.04 %

95
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,870
the CO2,

96
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,459
not only are they taking a low energy gas but it's a trace gas,

97
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:09,268
it's minuscule. I've said it took the of molecules in here and turn

98
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,188
them colors. The nitrogen in the air if that was say black and

99
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,169
that oxygen was red.

100
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,828
Now try and see the CO2 molecules. You  probably wouldn't be able to see them

101
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:24,628
they are such a trace gas. This is four out of every ten thousand molecules is

102
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:25,500
CO2.

103
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,120
That's what the plants are having to work with. They got to keep their stomates

104
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,409
wide open to get that CO2. People can breathe with not having to

105
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:43,230
exhale much water vapor because there's plenty of oxygen. As my friend and

106
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,879
colleague Rick Allen says,"

107
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,639
It's a good thing plants don't have to go anywhere because as soon as they

108
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,740
start to move they get out of breath

109
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,299
there is not enough oxygen." Of course this is going the other way,

110
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:57,870
here's the photosynthesis, here's respiration.

111
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,089
But this low gas is really the fundamental reason we have to give so

112
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,670
much water to plants so they can make our food. So that puts it in

113
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:14,370
perspective of the stakes in this thing, trying to optimize every drop of that

114
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,470
massive amount of water. That's why

115
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:24,669
I was honored to be able to give a TED talk and talk about this issue of where

116
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:27,189
all the water is going in agriculture.

117
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,670
I think to start this,

118
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,670
I'm going to start with

119
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:47,230
another important equation, the energy balance equation. I think I said in

120
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:55,778
the outline the multiple components of this. Let's leave that

121
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:57,669
up here for a minute.

122
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:08,588
Let's even start before that, first law of thermodynamics: energy E in

123
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:11,890
equals E out.

124
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:17,078


125
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:20,078


126
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:26,730
This is easily the most widely known and the most to me by far the most profound

127
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,210
of the laws of thermodynamics.

128
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,940
There's really three laws of thermodynamics: energy has to balance; the

129
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,220
second one is the world tends to more entropy meaning more randomness in the

130
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,120
world,

131
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,450
the planets are moving apart and and the world's becoming more

132
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:58,200
random, lower energy; and the third one has to do with absolute zero, as you get

133
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,379
closer to absolute zero that the energy in the system approaches 0.

134
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,850
I don't know why that law just doesn't say at absolute zero everything stops,

135
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,590
but it doesn't. It says as you approach absolute zero you get less energy.

136
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:20,310
Some British chemist said about these three laws he said the first

137
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:25,229
one you could say there's no free lunch. That's another way to say

138
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:33,300
this, but he said you can't win because it's always balanced.

139
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:39,329
The second law is you can't even break even

140
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:47,609
because the world tends to lower entropy. The third law you can't even get

141
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,690
out of the game.

142
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,480
yYou can't quit the game. You're always at some temperature.  We're

143
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,610
going to focus on this, energy and energy out. Right away if we can measure

144
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:07,710
these components we can calculate the missing components. In the simplest

145
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,930
sense,

146
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:13,799
if this is radiation in (R in).

147
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:22,409
For now we'll do R for radiation. Over here we have transpiration plus

148
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:25,889
conduction and convection.

149
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:31,740
Different people use different symbols for these but I have typically

150
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,289
used C^2.

151
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:40,379
For conduction and convection, we consider simultaneously. Ones the heat

152
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,149
going to the molecules and the molecules blowing away but they're in one term.

153
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:52,169
This doesn't mathematically mean C x C. It just means there's C, C or C squared.

154
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,389
That's pretty simple

155
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,389
that's the essence of this whole energy balance equation.

156
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,879
These have to balance. Why do we have whole text books on this thing to

157
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,220
analyze this if it's this simple?

158
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:16,680
This is reduced to the simplest components. Any good plant person is going to

159
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,909
say wait a minute, wait a minute there's photosynthesis in this and some of the

160
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:23,309
energy goes into photosynthesis

161
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:29,609
and it's correct. Over here we have

162
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:36,629
P for photosynthesis and that's some of the energy.

163
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:39,958
Now we're getting a little more complicated and more detailed. Llet me

164
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:47,519
stop right here and make a mention about some of the principles for this. Many

165
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,439
books talk about this.

166
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,270
Let me start with a different book. Pretty much every University teaches

167
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:02,009
plant physiology whether they're a agriculture, land grant school, or

168
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:07,139
anything, they teach plant physiology. Every year new editions of new plant

169
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,120
physiology textbooks come out,

170
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,799
this is Tyson Zygier the one we use her, and you open up this fat tree it

171
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,208
gets thicker every year.

172
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,750
Try to find energy balance analysis in this textbook.

173
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,980
It's not in here. That is not a traditional part

174
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,050
of plant physiology. This deals with chemical principles and it deals with

175
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:33,838
single leaves and when it gets to calculating evapotranspiration

176
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,669
that's not a subject covered in this book. They do cover

177
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:44,458
what causes stomates to open and close, which is a key part of this but

178
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,388
that's it.

179
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:50,669
They do mention water use efficiency in here but they don't talk

180
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:59,458
about covering that. Lots of other books do. One of my favorites that I

181
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,909
learned this stuff from, fortunately it's now in the fourth

182
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:07,169
edition, this book by Park Nobel,

183
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:13,860
Physicochemical and Environmental Plant Physiology. The principles of what I'm

184
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:21,209
talking about are in this book in chapter 7. I use the same symbols as

185
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,708
he does in this book.

186
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:27,778
It's a great reference for looking at the principles.

187
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:36,600
I brought with me a few other key books that have been important to me and

188
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,360
also talk about these principles. One that many people are familiar with is

189
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,389
Galen Campbell's book and John Norman, An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics.

190
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:51,839
This has got a lot of great stuff in it.

191
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,630
It shows basic equations for this. This is also a good reference on these things.

192
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:06,159
Hamlin Jones, Plants in Microclimate: a Quantitative Qpproach to Environmental

193
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,169
Plant Physiology.

194
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,740
Any time somebody puts quantitative approach in the title some of the

195
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,818
students go eeee I'm going to try to avoid that class and the other students

196
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:16,149
go

197
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:21,850
wow this is cool I gotta sign up for that. So it depends on how good people

198
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,088
are with quantitative approaches. Here's a third one,

199
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:28,659
Environmental Physiology of Plants.

200
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:32,500
This subject matter is covered in many books it's just not

201
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,609
covered in traditional plant physiology textbooks.

202
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:42,158
Let's go back to our equation here

203
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,730
we're putting in photosynthesis

204
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,940
because some of the energy goes there. If we were doing energy balance

205
00:17:51,940 --> 00:18:02,350
analysis of ourselves, which we do. We stand out in the Sun, we've got radiation

206
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,918
in. You gotta drink water

207
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:11,979
to stay hydrated. If you get hot, you lose heat by conduction and convection.

208
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,250
Photosynthesis

209
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,669
for most of us is approaching 0.

210
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:23,020
I'm still working on that chlorophyll gene so I can stand out in the sun and

211
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,369
then I don't have to eat.

212
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:32,859
Just have to get green skin. Our bodies are above room temperature

213
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:36,099
because of respiration.

214
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:46,129
Now we've got respiration in here and in the case of plants so do they have

215
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:52,639
respiration. When they respire, that's exothermic and that warms them up.

216
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:57,979
Because respiration is adding to the heat

217
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:04,850
we really have to do something like minus respiration

218
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:09,079
because it's it's giving off heat, it's not using it.

219
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:19,579
Any time we burn up heat. Those four components are the essence of this,

220
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:21,230
for this side.

221
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:29,269
What happens when something changes temperature? Energy in equals energy out.

222
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:39,378
This balances over long time periods but if you take a

223
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:45,259
black piece of metal and walk out in the sunlight out there and lay it out

224
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:51,648
it's going to get hotter. It's going to get hot fast and this won't balance

225
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:57,079
because it's heating up. Some of the energy is going in to change the

226
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,548
temperature. Then we bring that back into the room and it's cooling down;

227
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:06,230
we got all our hundred instruments around this thing

228
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,149
and energy doesn't balance.

229
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:13,308
It's cooling off because it doesn't balance. We have to have another term over here

230
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:17,210
and that's usually called G and that is storage.

231
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:27,039
Now storage is easy. That's either heating up and cooling off.

232
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:34,569
In the case of a leaf and my analysis is going to do a single leaf,

233
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:39,099
just one leaf out there in the Sun. How are we going to make the energy

234
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:43,149
balance for that? We get a leaf right and then we can go to bigger things canopies

235
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,220
and all kinds of bigger things.

236
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,789
How much goes into photosynthesis?

237
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:57,789
Let's just start with a rough estimate of the size of these parameters up here.

238
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,420
I'm going to ask you

239
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,410
how efficient is photosynthesis? Chris you ought to know this from some classes.

240
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,410
What's the efficiency of photosynthesis? You can

241
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,580
say in the test tube algae can be this good and in the field this good, but

242
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:27,059
about how efficient is photosynthesis? Do you have any idea?

243
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,549
Boston do you know? That's correct it's not very dang efficient.

244
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:38,339
What does that mean, less than fifty percent? Less than twenty percent?

245
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,549
Photosynthesis can be up to thirty percent efficient in a test tube with algea

246
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:57,240
in perfect conditions, but when we go to the field

247
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:03,599
we're talking more like five percent efficiency. It obviously varies.

248
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,490
How bright the light is, there's a whole bunch of factors. Let's

249
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,940
just go with five percent here.

250
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:21,139
That means ninety-five percent of the action is somewhere else in this equation.

251
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:33,799
If photosynthesis is five percent, how much energy comes out in respiration?

252
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:40,460
In people,  if its energy balance in people its food. You eat. That's how much energy you get.

253
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,419
This has to balance in food too. So if we ate 5 grams of food we had 5

254
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:49,370
grams of respiration.

255
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:55,219
In plants that are growing, respirations typically a third of

256
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,600
photosynthesis

257
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:05,750
because they're storing energy as they get bigger. Respiration might be two

258
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:13,250
percent. We're getting down to some terms that

259
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:22,609
are pretty small, here, and then storage in a single leaf, storage is

260
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,079
insignificant.

261
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,648
I'm going to see if I can draw a

262
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:37,228
that three-dimensional leaf here,  something like this. One of the

263
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:45,778
calculations in Park Nobel's book is how much a leaf could store?

264
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:50,069
How much energy a leaf could store given the magnitude of the radiation coming in

265
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:55,288
and he shows mathematically it's insignificant. A leaf is so thin

266
00:23:55,288 --> 00:24:01,828
there's not much mass there and fifty percent of the leaf is air leaf. A leaf is just

267
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:07,168
a bunch of cells with air in between them and it's a fraction of a

268
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:10,169
millimeter thick. In a single leaf

269
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:15,239
we just ignore storage. This is absolutely not true as soon as soil

270
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:19,979
enters the equation. Soil now is huge but when we're talking about the leaves of

271
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:20,879
plants

272
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:24,748
storage is insignificant and both of these are tiny.

273
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:36,479
We can easily calculate this one too because... let me draw a graph of this.

274
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:43,409
Let's think about this efficiency of photosynthesis for a

275
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:52,259
minute. If I draw a graph,  of photosynthesis.

276
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,669
I love drawn XY plot so I get a lot of XY plots. Sometimes I think I dream

277
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:09,719
in XY plots. But here's radiation in and and here's 0 so it's dark and we

278
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,149
get up here to,

279
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:19,798
1000 watts per meter squared.

280
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:24,358
This would be typically full sunlight in a summer day.

281
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:33,808
Normally we do this graph with just photosynthetic radiation with photons

282
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:38,398
but for these purposes this is ok. We got energy coming in and over here we're

283
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:38,829
going to have

284
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:46,480
photosynthesis. Here's another thing that people understand the shape of this

285
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,269
graph at different levels.

286
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:57,519
If this was a high school class a correct answer to that question if

287
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,950
somebody said it looks like that,

288
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,950
they probably get full credit.

289
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,390
But what's wrong with this straight line?

290
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:16,120
Why is that not full credit for a more advanced class? What does it look like?

291
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:20,109
Yeah,  it can't keep going;

292
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:26,769
it tops out. So that part's wrong, so it tops out.

293
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:35,829
Now we're up to plant science 301 and that's the correct answer, but

294
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:40,329
it's not correct for plant science 501 or whatever number we are putting on

295
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:41,230
this.

296
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,230
What's still wrong about that?

297
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:51,158
What if we put a plant in the dark,

298
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:56,259
reagent grade darkness right here?

299
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:59,349
These are not plastic plants,

300
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:02,349
they are real plants. We put them in the dark,

301
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:09,398
they have respiration. So we put the plant in the dark and this is 0.

302
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:20,138
It has to go somewhere down here this line has to curve like that.

303
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,250
Now that line is correct at plant science 501.

304
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:35,160
We've got this dynamic down here at zero and we've got the flat line as a general

305
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:42,990
shape of this line. When we get these five percent numbers were usually

306
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,230
somewhere, I'll  put this in green,

307
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:52,019
we're usually somewhere on this part of the curve, early part of the curve where

308
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,059
we get higher photosynthesis.

309
00:27:54,059 --> 00:28:03,450
By the time we get out to full Sun and we're out here. We're down to maybe

310
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,069
two percent efficient  in full Sun because it just tops out.

311
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:11,250
When we say five percent, yeah that's correct

312
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:16,140
if the sun's not too bright. This is the efficiency is like this and here's

313
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,890
five percent and that's that slope of that line is more like two percent.

314
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,800
Most of this transpiration is just what we ultimately after in this thing is

315
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,769
happening during the bright light parts of the day and the rest of this we

316
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:39,990
can ignore it for the for the first order estimates of transpiration and

317
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,690
conduction and convection. There are times when a refined analysis will

318
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:52,350
include photosynthesis but typically not. Typically we're just dealing with this

319
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:59,879
part right here, even though that's the full equation as it relates to plants.

320
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:07,780
We can put numbers on this, quickly put numbers on this and the sum of these two

321
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,349
fluxes has to equal this one.

322
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,880
Let's do a very quick calculation. I just love back-of-the-envelope

323
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,840
calculations. The goal of this classes to get everybody to were every time

324
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,789
somebody asks a question they go,

325
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:34,889
"mmm you got some paper" and you can calculate stuff. There's all kinds of

326
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,280
things you can calculate if you get started and get a little background.

327
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:52,590
Let's say we have radiation in, 1000 watts per meter squared.

328
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:00,269
Now this is a nice number to remember because right now that's about the

329
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:03,118
radiation outside this classroom

330
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:13,949
coming in. Let's say our leaf right here is evaporating, to be anatomically

331
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,359
correct

332
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:18,358
water always has to be shown in blue,

333
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:26,009
this leaf is evaporating enough water to stay exactly at the same temperature as

334
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:26,970
the air.

335
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:33,720
This happens all the time you put a wet dishrag on your clothesline, black

336
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,118
dishrag maybe to simulate a leaf, and measure the temperature of that it's

337
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:42,839
going to be pretty close to air temperature because it's evaporating

338
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:50,368
water at the same rate as that energy is coming in, and in fact a very wet dishrag

339
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:55,048
is pretty often below air temperature around here.

340
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:57,538
Then as soon as it starts to dry out,

341
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:02,519
now it's still evaporating water, but it goes above air temperature. Let's say

342
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:09,239
it's the same. So conduction and

343
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:19,409
convection is 0, and if it's the same at this leaf is 25 degrees C and the air

344
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:29,099
is 25 degrees C that exchange is 0. Now we have really simplified this energy

345
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:32,428
balance analysis to see where we're at.

346
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:36,570
We got 100 watts coming in zero is here,

347
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:41,340
how much water does it  evaporate?

348
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:53,339
What you find out in this analysis is a huge part of it is just

349
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:59,189
units conversion from getting one unit to the next getting all straightened out,

350
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,930
and once you get that then I tell people a monkey could do the last part

351
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,680
of it. Just the computer can do the last part of it  if you get the units right.

352
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:17,160
What we want to know is transpiration and what we know is energy coming in.

353
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,890
Let's start by looking up

354
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,750
a typical number.

355
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:42,609
I can  put this over here, I can even zoom in. Here we go, now too much zoom in. This

356
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:48,459
is out of this book right here, Utah Climate.

357
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,980
It's  published by the climate center and it's just a bunch of statistics of

358
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:01,750
climate. In this example here, I have pulled out the campus weather station.

359
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,980
This is this is 30-year data this is not our new environmental observatory, this

360
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,960
is a older station,

361
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,769
real old up by the place you buy ice cream up there, nutrition and food

362
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:18,579
science. Here's every month of the year,

363
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,690
evapotranspiration, inches per month.

364
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:33,160
Now we're going to take the highest transpiration month of the year 7.48

365
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,180
inches.

366
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,360
This is per month, and that is 0.24 inches per day

367
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:44,739
It's 0.6 centimeters a day.

368
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,400
This is measured by, I think this one

369
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,840
this is measured by pan evaporation Taking a pan with water in it and look

370
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:58,539
at how much water evaporates in that pan. It is a old time-honored, simple method

371
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:11,619
to do this. Pan evaporation, we get a number right here equals 0.6

372
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,609
centimeters per day.

373
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,940
This is supposed to balance but we don't have the units in the right order

374
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,740
yet. To put the units in the right order,

375
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:36,920
there's one key number that you could probably have tattooed on your arm so

376
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,400
you could always remember this number

377
00:34:40,400 --> 00:35:02,720
LHE (Latent Heat of Evaporation) and I use this number enough I can remember it,

378
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:11,269
2.45 megajoules per liter.

379
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:20,409
This is close to a constant. If the water is almost boiling,

380
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:27,880
this is something like 2.41 and  if the water is freezing it's something like

381
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:37,780
2.49, but it's 2.45 megajoules per liter at 25 degrees C. Really this

382
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,730
temperature doesn't matter that much.

383
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,170
This is three significant digits all of them round off

384
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:48,430
to 2.45. Okay, great.

385
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:54,219
But neither liters nor megajoules is in this equation yet.

386
00:35:54,219 --> 00:36:03,338
For this first lecture, I want to take some units and see if this is 0

387
00:36:03,338 --> 00:36:11,858
if we do this conversion here.

388
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:31,059
1000 watts is coming in. This is a real simple physical principle but

389
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,949
it trips people up a lot.

390
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:43,778
A watt is a rate of energy flow. Most people could probably answer on a test

391
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:50,528
a watt is a Joule per second. We just have this happen so much rates of energy

392
00:36:50,528 --> 00:36:53,259
we just have this nickname form called the Watt,

393
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:57,429
but it trips people up sometimes. I think the whole thing would be simpler if we

394
00:36:57,429 --> 00:37:03,369
always just said joules per second but going back and forth and this is a is

395
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:04,989
really helpful.

396
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:13,778
One of the ways to help think about this is if we had a gallon of gas

397
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:25,028
sitting here and you said how many watts are in that gallon of gas ,and somebody

398
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:28,539
whips out their phone and they say, "Um watts in a gallon of gas" and they say, "I can't

399
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:29,289
find it".

400
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:35,259
If you said how much energy is in that gallon of gas,

401
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:40,389
it's easy you can find the energy in a gallon gas. It's six to the tenth

402
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:43,868
bajillion joules of energy in a gallon of gas.

403
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:47,108
If I light a match and I blow it up,

404
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:53,199
it is six brazilian watts of power because it grew up in one second.

405
00:37:53,199 --> 00:38:00,130
A watt is a rate of energy like release or energy transfer and  jewels is the

406
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,869
fundamental unit of energy.

407
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:10,059
Let's put this down here, 1000 joules per meter squared per

408
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,349
second.

409
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:17,420
We're dealing with centimeters a day.

410
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:25,009
I can see a conversion I need to make right away.

411
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:32,690
This is the maximum rate of energy coming in, in the middle of the day.

412
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,220
This one is the total water for the whole day.

413
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:46,699
Over here we got seconds and over here we got days. I have to put

414
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,939
another curve here.

415
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,389
This is solar noon and up here

416
00:38:57,259 --> 00:39:05,539
this is 1000 watts per meter squared, the brightest we get typically

417
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,680
in the middle of the day.

418
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:12,858
If we're going to compare all the energy coming in a day to all the water

419
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:14,478
we used in a day,

420
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:24,828
we have to have the area under that curve. When we do that we get 30 mega

421
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:31,160
joules per meter squared per day.

422
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:35,239
These are full Sun summer day,

423
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:41,389
30 mega joules integrated under the curve. For comparison,

424
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:47,449
over here I'm going to change my units instead of 1000

425
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:52,129
joule, 30 mega joules per day.

426
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,130
We at least have the time

427
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:03,769
on the same on both axes. 0.6 centimeters of water from a pan

428
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:09,288
evaporating to possibly keep this equal.

429
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:26,200
We have to get this meter squared equal on both sides. To do that we're

430
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:30,489
going to take a tray, a giant cookie sheet.

431
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:34,179
We should sell cookie sheets, one meter squared cookie sheets for teaching

432
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:37,480
purposes because you could lay them out you could put water in them.

433
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:44,559
This is 1 meter squared. Our reference sheet,

434
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:53,199
the radiation is coming in to that one meter squared. If we evaporate 0.6

435
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,149
centimeters of water,

436
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:03,849
how many liters is that? To put the liters equal,

437
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:06,940
so this is 100 centimeters,

438
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:16,150
this is 100 centimeters, so 1 meter squared is 10,000 centimeters squared (10

439
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,278
to the fourth). This trips people up a lot because so much stuff is 10 to the

440
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,460
third, 10 to the third, everything's multiples of ten to the third.

441
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,940
This one is not, this is 10 to the fourth because it's a hundred times a hundred.

442
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:38,409
Then remember another reason that the metric system is so far superior to any

443
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:51,219
other system 1 centimeter cubed, is one milliliter, is one gram,

444
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:58,249
Which everybody learns that in high school. Then I do a true/false test

445
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:03,618
and I say this and this is one milligram, and I put the milla really big and half

446
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,900
the class misses it.  It's a gram.

447
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:12,229
This is a milliliter but that's a gram. Okay we're getting close to getting our

448
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:13,489
units the same.

449
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:29,420
One liter is 10 x 10 to 10 a thousand cubic centimeters.

450
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:45,929
One centimeter deep, one centimeter of water times ten to the fourth

451
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:57,149
centimeters of area is is a 10 to the fourth centimeters cubed or 10,000

452
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:06,809
centimeters cubed or ten thousand grams and ten thousand milliliters.

453
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:12,480
One centimeter deep is 10 liters

454
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:25,108
when we do this evaporation.  0.6 centimeters centimeters per

455
00:43:25,108 --> 00:43:31,980
day is 6 liters

456
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:44,769
per meter squared per day. I went over

457
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:52,989
this math pretty fast but it's not complicated. A centimeter deep on

458
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:58,838
on a liter tray. If we had a meter of water and we poured into a meter squared

459
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:01,599
tray,  it would be a millimeter deep.

460
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,369
If we had 10 meters of water and we poured it in it would be a centimeter deep in

461
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:15,670
the tray. Therefore, 0.6  centimeters a day in a meter squared area is 6 liters of

462
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:24,369
water. We have 30 mega joules coming in per meter squared per day,

463
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:29,230
now we finally got units the same, meter squared per day and we can cancel those out.

464
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:37,659
30 mega joules in 6 liters now we bring out our latent heat of evaporation

465
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:56,078
and 30 mega joules divided by 2.45 megajoules per liter, and I

466
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,450
think this comes out to about 12

467
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:05,980
liters per meter squared

468
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,980
per day.

469
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,939
This is how much water would have to evaporate to keep this thing at the

470
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:25,679
exact same same temperature as the air, and what happened in this calculation

471
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,919
when we measure this we only get 6 liters.

472
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,020
Now I'm going to wind up in this  principal because tomorrow will pick it

473
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:40,889
up from here, if this was all that was going on you would then right in your

474
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:48,449
notebooks well clearly the object got hot because it doesn't balance. It needed

475
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:54,599
to about evaporate 12 liters of water to keep itself at air temperature and

476
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,980
these plants only evaporated 6.

477
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,250
It doesn't balance, this cannot be 0.

478
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:11,460
It heats up. You would be correct in the analysis of this, but it's more

479
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,019
complicated than that.

480
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:23,009
This is only a short wave radiation in. This was a very simple analysis. This

481
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:30,000
assumed every watt of this was absorbed and some of this gets reflected, some

482
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,210
gets transmitted. This is only short wave radiation we have to calculate

483
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:42,210
long-wave radiation to do a comprehensive analysis.

484
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:49,679
I filled up the board but tomorrow we'll break down this radiation into its

485
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:57,419
component parts to see how much of that radiation actually got absorbed.

486
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:04,079
Here is a perfect example. We do pan evaporation right to get these numbers.

487
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,309
Just put a pan out measure the water evaporating, time-honored. What if the

488
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:13,710
tray is made out of aluminum foil and another tray is painted

489
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:19,829
flat black. Huge difference in evaporation from those two so

490
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:25,278
we got account for the different amounts of radiation absorbed in order to make

491
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:31,518
this balance.This is an empirical number 0.6 centimeters a day

492
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:32,449
during them

493
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:39,108
hottest month of the year around here. Once we get this number

494
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:45,440
analyzed then we can start to look at partitioning between how hot the object

495
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,759
gets and how much water  has to evaporate.

496
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:56,150
This is driven by just the temperature

497
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,139
difference.

498
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:00,949
We can measure the temperature difference of this and we start to zero

499
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:06,108
in on transpiration, which like I said we don't have any good instruments to

500
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:15,018
measure that directly but this is an example of some simple units to get to

501
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:15,558
this.

502
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:22,670
I  like to end sometimes with

503
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:27,260
a homework assignment, which i'll just tell you the homework assignments in

504
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,880
here and you can decide if you want to work them. So I said this whole

505
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:38,269
thing is units conversion.

506
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:43,309
Here is a homework assignment, I sometimes given this on the first day of class.

507
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:49,039
Einstein's, it's one of the one of the top five most important equations in the

508
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:57,920
world, E equals MC squared. How much energy is in one pea seed? If this is right, and how long could you live if you

509
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,980
just ate one pea seed and you could use all the energy and that pea seed? Of course c

510
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,769
squared, speed of light squared is a huge numbers so it's a lot of energy. This

511
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:14,570
is about the simplest equation you can get and now think about units conversion.

512
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:22,039
Get the energy in a pea seed from the typical weight of a pea and then this.

513
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:31,369
MC squared with SI units and SI unit conversion comes out to be joules

514
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:39,170
of energy in the pea seed. I'll show you the key for this tomorrow.

515
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:43,039
The key for this is setting it up with the units.

516
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,130
All of you know SI units.

517
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,798
Here's a nice symbol for the whole world and SI units are of course wonderfully

518
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:21,099
simple. Seven base units and these calculations get immensely easier

519
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:24,910
when you get them down to base units

520
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:28,058
so we can compare different things.

521
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:31,420
Now days you can

522
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:38,318
look these up on them internet, not just the base units but all the relationships.

523
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,679
Most of them are so simple like watt and joules per second you remember them,

524
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:52,808
but here's a little handout that I've found useful on this for some of the

525
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:53,890
relationships.

526
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:59,078
This is a two sided hand out and it it helps to understand the relationships.

527
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:02,710
When we talk about energy balance

528
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:08,980
we're only talking about a very small subset of all the units in here but it

529
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,980
helps too

530
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:19,789
be fluent in the in the simplest relationships of SI units. his is

531
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:23,269
something I found that is useful.

532
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:27,739
I got a second one that I found useful.

533
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:34,700
It just looks like this. The first ones that double-sided, it's got some units on

534
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:39,919
the back. This is just conversions among units. Every single beginning

535
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:48,769
chemistry book has these SI units in the front and sometimes I think people see

536
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:52,338
those in the go yeah good and then they can forget about them for years and years.

537
00:51:52,338 --> 00:51:57,440
Then you get to an energy balance analysis and you have to remember them

538
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,329
and use them.

539
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:05,960
I'm going to stop here and pick this up tomorrow.

540
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,309
There's no two sides it's all,  it's just it's one side.

541
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:59,629
No I'm wrong

542
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:04,490
it does have two sides. It just takes a subset of the units. It does have two

543
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:11,659
sides. The first side is self-sufficient and the next side is a is a subset of these with

544
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:18,049
some of the more common ones. We can copy this and I can give you the second side

545
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,050
tomorrow.

546
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:32,129
Any questions on how to apply this? Mark

547
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,050
Point number two on and indicates the seven components of energy balance.

548
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Are you splitting conduction and convection into two?

549
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:50,389
No for the purpose of this  class I'm going to introduce the seventh

550
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:51,559
term tomorrow.

551
00:53:51,559 --> 00:54:00,920
In a nutshell it's splitting radiation into short and long wave.

552
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:16,219
I like to start with the simplest thing and then get more complex.

553
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:21,829
I mean to work this out in five or eight minutes and and

554
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:27,349
finally get it in the same units that's the essence of energy balance.

555
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:28,549
Then you get to where,

556
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,420
okay it doesn't balance now why not.

557
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,369
Are our instruments not calibrated

558
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:41,839
and the answer in this particular case is the model is not complex enough yet

559
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,730
to account for that.

560
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:51,409
The model needs to be more detailed to account for it. As a

561
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:57,799
rule of thumb well watered plants stay very close to air

562
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:04,580
temperature. This term for well watered plants is always small and if we

563
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:10,699
get all the radiation right and this is exactly air temperature

564
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:16,429
then we know transpiration. But we gotta do short and long wave both to get that

565
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:17,210
term right.

566
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,730
As soon as they run out of water,  imagine a cactus in the desert.

567
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:27,559
One of my students came back and he said it's a hundred..They were in Phoenix

568
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,900
last week and they said I can't see how people live there.

569
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,869
They go from one building as quick as a possible to the next

570
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:33,980
air-conditioned building.

571
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:39,139
It was a hundred and fifteen in the day but it cooled off  to 90 at night.

572
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:45,099
How far is my car, can I make it?

573
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:53,139
But imagine a cactus without water. The tissues of that cactus are

574
00:55:53,139 --> 00:56:02,440
just astronomically hot and it just sits there.

575
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,849
We can run this the other way, what if T was zero?

576
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:13,000
We run this analysis for putting a metal hammer

577
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,630
outside in the Sun let it get to equilibrium, now trying to pick up the

578
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:20,890
hammer and it's so hot you can't pick it up. Because this is an enormous number

579
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:36,879
and this one's 0.  I'm thinking if we do every day this

580
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,660
week,

581
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:46,029
that's five lectures. I put eight lectures but when I look at what

582
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,100
I've done it

583
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:53,170
typically it's maybe more like six or seven lectures.

584
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,950
Usually I give a pretty long lecture in the beginning about how I'm going to grade

585
00:56:56,949 --> 00:57:00,489
the class and stuff like that and we can just skip all that.

586
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:06,669
We could do this whole thing by the end of the week maybe.

587
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:14,500
Let's see how we're at, how we go. Particularly today I tried to do, I don't

588
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,789
know how long was that.

589
00:57:17,789 --> 00:57:22,199
That was including the introductory stuff that we might edit out.

590
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:29,639
I'm going to try to one hour of stuff but ifIi did an hour and a

591
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:33,119
half where we did some and we stopped and took a little break

592
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,409
you know it could we could get done by the end of the week. If we get into

593
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:42,269
more details and there's more questions well then it will take longer

594
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:45,269
but that's good.

595
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,529
I'll try to weave into this

596
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:54,960
the instruments we use. Everything's a component of the of the whole thing.

597
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,340
There's no single instrument to measure what we want to know. We just surround it

598
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:06,300
with indirect instruments and basically calculated by subtraction, which is how

599
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:11,160
we do everything and if we can measure something easily then we just measure it.
