00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:23,419
If you have a meter with a part number that starts  with "MQ," "MU," "MP," or "MI," then this is a user guide for you.  

5
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:27,240
First off, let's do a quick overview of the device.

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,556
First, you have the meter,

7
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:33,493
power button, sample button, or I like to think of it as a back button,

8
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,896
a mode button, kind of an enter button, as well,

9
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:38,399
an up and down,

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,865
a USB port,

11
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:43,335
the battery cover on the back, as  well as a 1/4-20 thread mount,

12
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:45,869
the sensor cap,

13
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,307
and the sensor itself.

14
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:53,410
Before we get too far, there  are two things to note.  

15
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:57,182
First of all, the M series meters are not waterproof.

16
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,326
If you get a little bit of water  on it that's fine, it'll wipe off.

17
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,350
But the sensor  head is waterproof and submergible.

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,655
The other thing to keep in mind is that when you press the buttons,  they need to be firm intentional pushes.

19
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:12,158
If you push it too light or too fast, it won't register .

20
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:16,328
We're going to show you now how to insert  or change the battery.

21
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:19,799
First, flip the unit over.

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,397
Remove the screw.

23
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,640
With the screw removed, take the cover, pull the cover up  slightly, and then push to the right, and then lift up.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,305
It'll come right off.

25
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:36,277
To remove the battery, I like to use the screwdriver that I just removed the screw with,

26
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,445
press down slightly, and pull to  the right.

27
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,415
Now you have the battery out.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,900
Make sure that when you insert the battery, or you  change the battery, you use the CR2320 size,

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,856
and make sure that when you put the battery  back in, it's oriented correctly:  

30
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:54,524
the positive side should be facing up.

31
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:58,728
I like to take the leading edge of the cover, and  put it right on the back of the battery holder,  

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,332
and then push down into the left.

33
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:07,562
At this point you can put the screw back on,

34
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,273
and you're done!

35
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:19,243
If for chance you have a low battery indicator that doesn't go away when you replace the battery,

36
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:21,111
you need to do a master reset.

37
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:27,084
To do this, leave the unit powered on, and then remove the battery.

38
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:30,719
This should make that low battery indicator go away.

39
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,087
Let's go into how to use the meter.

40
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:36,057
First of all, make sure you remove the cap from the sensor itself.

41
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,361
Turn the unit on, press the power button.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,784
To turn the unit off, push the power button again.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,336
Keep in mind that this unit does have an auto power off function and will automatically turn off after a few minutes.

44
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,437
Welcome to the home screen.

45
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:56,439
From here you can see how many data sets you have saved,

46
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,207
your current data readings,

47
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,443
and what mode you're in.

48
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:03,211
From this screen, we can see we're in sample mode.

49
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:08,983
The "M" series meters have two modes.  The first mode is the sample mode.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,280
This is a mode where you can go around collecting data  and saving data by pressing the sample button.

51
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,826
You'll see the count goes up. That number is now saved.

52
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,794
That data is saved up to 99 data points.

53
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,665
Be aware that save data doesn't come  with a location or a time stamp,

54
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:30,668
so make sure you write down and document your location.

55
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,637
To review the data points, press the up and down arrows.

56
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:42,877
To go back after viewing the different data  sets, press the sample button to go back.

57
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,513
And now we're back in sampling mode.  

58
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:49,481
To change modes, press the mode button.

59
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:54,152
The blinking mode tells you which mode you've selected, so currently we're in sample mode.

60
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:57,155
If you press the down button, it'll change to log mode.

61
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:02,659
Press the mode button or enter button.  I like to think mode and enter are the same button.

62
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:08,698
Next, it'll ask you whether you want to run that mode or  whether you want to reset the data in that mode.

63
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:13,020
From here, if you want to run,  just push the mode button or the enter button.

64
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,906
If you want to clear the data that  you have saved, press the mode button,

65
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,311
select sample, and then you have to hold  down the down button,

66
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:31,848
and then push the mode button,  and then it will clear your data set. 

67
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,084
You can see that because it'll zero out the data sets.

68
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:38,454
The other mode that the "M" series meters have is the log mode.

69
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:44,526
In the log mode, the meter itself  will take a reading every 30 seconds,

70
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:48,496
and then average that over the course of 30 minutes.

71
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:52,531
Those 30 minutes will be saved into the data set.

72
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:56,269
The meter will also save 48 of those as a daily total.

73
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:01,620
Those daily totals are only accessible via desktop PC, and we'll show you how to do that in just a minute.

74
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,641
To get to the log mode, press the mode button,

75
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:07,710
press down,

76
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,680
and log should begin to blink.

77
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,316
When it's blinking, press the mode or enter button,

78
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:17,284
and then press the enter button to run the log mode.

79
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,420
Log mode will automatically begin.

80
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,420
The meter will eventually automatically turn off. 

81
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:26,693
The meter will automatically turn on every 30 seconds and collect data.

82
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:32,930
That data is averaged into a 30 minute average, which is then recorded in  a data field.

83
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,933
Those data points are reviewable by using the up and down buttons.

84
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:40,070
To return back to the log mode, press the sample button.

85
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,675
On both sample and log mode, the maximum number of data points that can you save is 99.

86
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:49,311
If you go more than 99, the meter will erase the oldest data set first.

87
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,281
All the data sets are available from the "M" series meter on the desktop application.

88
00:05:54,314 --> 00:06:01,821
In order to access the data from the "M" series meter,  you need to use the AC-100 USB adapter.

89
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:05,940
It might look like a regular USB adapter, but it's not.

90
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,692
A regular USB cable will not work.

91
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:11,662
I'll show you now how to access that information with a PC computer.

92
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,765
This is the AC-100. This will convert a UART protocol to a USB protocol.

93
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:22,170
Along with the AC-100 cable, there's a flash drive that comes with it that has the software on it.

94
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,973
If for some reason you lose the flash drive or you want more up-to-date software,

95
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:28,408
you can go to the Apogee Instruments' website.

96
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:31,377
I'll show you how to do that.  First, go to the Apogee Instruments' website.

97
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:34,346
Scroll down to the bottom of the page.

98
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,380
Under the support column, you'll see "Software Downloads."

99
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,720
Scroll down until you see handheld meter data collection software, also known as the ApogeeAMS. 

100
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,019
We'll install it for PC.

101
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,235
Go through and install that software.

102
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:05,204
After the software has been installed, it should look something like this.

103
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:09,974
Now you need to connect the meter to the computer.

104
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:24,952
With the meter plugged in, you need to select the communication port.

105
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:28,956
Over in this box, in the lower right corner, you'll see a drop down tab.

106
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,692
This automatically pops up as COM3.

107
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,194
Click on that, and click "Open Port." 

108
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:39,165
If for some reason you can't find a port available, you need to type it in.

109
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:46,002
To do that, go to your search bar and search "Device Manager."

110
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:58,245
From here, look at this list and find "Ports."

111
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:03,150
Click on the "Ports." This will show you which port is available.

112
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,353
This one is COM3.

113
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:10,389
So remember that COM3,

114
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,593
and type in COM3,  and then click "Open Port"

115
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:15,595
Now we can see that we are connected

116
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:20,030
From here, we can view the sample data,

117
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,899
the 30 minute averages--

118
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,168
sometimes it might take a few  minutes to load all the data, so be patient--

119
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,138
as well as the daily totals.

120
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,877
This data is in CSV format, or Comma Separated Value.

121
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:43,281
You can use a spreadsheet program like Excel or  Google Sheets to convert this into cell data.

122
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:47,985
Using your cursor, select the data that you'd like to copy.

123
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:52,056
Hit Ctrl + C to copy that data, and then open your spreadsheet of choice. 

124
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,091
We're going to be using Microsoft Excel.

125
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:57,091
Once it's open, select the cell  

126
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,062
and paste that data into that cell.

127
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:02,062
It'll be one long string of values.

128
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,966
You need to convert that into cells.

129
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:09,903
So, select that cell you pasted the data into, then go to "Data,"

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,272
and click on "Text to Columns."

131
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:15,240
When it's open, choose the delimited option,

132
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,209
and then hit "Next."

133
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,120
Make sure you separate by commas, and then hit "Next."

134
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:26,115
and then you can hit "Finished."

135
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:29,084
That'll turn that data into cells.

136
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,085
Select those cells,

137
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:34,559
go to "Insert,"

138
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,725
click on "Charts,"

139
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,725
and then I just chose a line chart.

140
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:45,698
As you can see, it gives you the data. And now you have a quick data analysis.

141
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:48,766
For more information, please see the user manual.

142
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:52,137
This is available at the Apogee Instruments' website on the product page,

143
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:54,136
or available on the link below.

144
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:57,574
If you have any other questions, leave a comment below.

145
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,573
Thank you so much for watching, and have a great day!
