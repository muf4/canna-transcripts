1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,650
good morning this is I'm Bruce Bugbee

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,138
and today we're going to talk about air

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,888
temperature sensors this is really part

4
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:15,138
one in a series of environmental

5
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:18,649
measurement seminars that we've designed

6
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:24,049
to educate people on the key principles

7
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:26,209
I am joined in this effort by my

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,329
colleague mark blonde twist who is the

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,439
chief scientist for Apogee instruments

10
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,558
he isn't going to be doing the talking

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,609
but he and I have worked together to

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:38,808
analyze a wide range of sensors for

13
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:40,579
environmental measurement so we're gonna

14
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:42,468
start with perhaps the most fundamental

15
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,609
measurement of all which is air

16
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:49,010
temperature if you would ask me when I

17
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:51,320
was an undergraduate do you know how to

18
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,178
measure air temperature I would say yes

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,308
of course I know all about it if you

20
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:56,899
would ask me as a master's student do I

21
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:58,849
know how to measure air temperature and

22
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,308
I was saying yes yeah that kind of but

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,099
there's challenges and if you ask me as

24
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:05,780
a experience scientist do I know how to

25
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,089
measure air temperature and I probably

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,790
say something like whoo that is a really

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,409
challenging measurement so we're going

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,340
to help bring you up to the cutting edge

29
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:18,709
of just the sensors today to do this in

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,260
a separate talk we'll talk about shields

31
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:23,509
so this is the simplest thing what kind

32
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,900
of electronic sensors were used for air

33
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,630
temperature measurement and historically

34
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,380
we've used alcohol thermometers and

35
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:35,479
mercury and glass thermometers but those

36
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,789
are not electronic output you can't

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,920
record those you've got to have a sensor

38
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,010
that makes an electric output so we can

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,799
do continuous recording of it so this is

40
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:49,430
all about sensors that have electronic

41
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,129
output now let's jump to a picture that

42
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:58,580
we've made that shows sizes and types of

43
00:01:52,129 --> 00:02:00,799
sensors here's a wide range of sizes and

44
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,560
in a minute I'll tell you why size is so

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,750
critical but let's just run over the

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,989
sizes all the way from the human hair

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:13,330
and look at the size of this 0.002

48
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:15,759
inches 0.06 millimeters this is tiny

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,270
just barely above that we can get fine

50
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,979
wire through misters that are just

51
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,610
barely thicker than a human hair now

52
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:26,679
these are used to in use in a syringe to

53
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,350
inject into an animal to measure

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,780
internal temperature of an animal but

55
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,419
boy they stay very close to air

56
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,169
temperature because they are so tiny so

57
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:42,069
this would be a nice sensor but this

58
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:45,189
sensor in our long-term studies drifts

59
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,289
it's not a stable sensor and that's a

60
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:49,810
critical feature of these sensors they

61
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:53,349
have to be rock-solid year after year

62
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,719
after year so we're not using this fine

63
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,419
wire sensor even though it's wonderfully

64
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:02,520
tiny because it's not solid and

65
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:06,129
long-term studies going up the scale

66
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,709
thermocouples are a classic electronic

67
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:11,799
way of measurement they're widely used

68
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:14,080
they're inexpensive is taken strip a

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,500
wire twist it like this you've got a

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,410
temperature sensor but they are not the

71
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,280
most accurate reference standard and for

72
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:27,579
long runs of wire they get expensive the

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,120
cost of thermocouple wire is about ten

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,000
times the cost of regular wire so we

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,640
mostly use these when we need to do lots

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,610
of measurements in a small distance a

77
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:43,419
small distance from the data logger even

78
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,510
though they can be small so then we

79
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:50,738
going down the list we get into the

80
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:53,500
category of thermistors so let's put a

81
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:57,519
line under thermocouples we'll call that

82
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,590
number one not thermocouples or

83
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,030
thermistor rather are number two and

84
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,939
technologies these are have a big signal

85
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,759
size they're easy to measure for years

86
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:12,069
these were considered not a reference

87
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:16,689
standard because they drifted in the

88
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:20,379
long term so to avoid this problem with

89
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:23,829
drift for years we've gone to platinum

90
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:25,560
resistance thermometers now lots of

91
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:30,209
people know these by the acronym

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:36,089
P R T platinum resistance thermometer

93
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:38,729
sometimes people say P R T D and that's

94
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:39,750
just a temperature detector those are

95
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:45,060
the same things

96
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:48,180
P R T and P R T key this one like the

97
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,000
typical PR T's is enclosed in a

98
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,350
stainless steel sheath that makes this

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,240
extremely rugged but it's a bigger size

100
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:04,889
than this thermistor slightly bigger and

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,800
a lot more expensive so finally to get

102
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,740
this even more rugged Apogee sells a

103
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,720
ceramic sheath thermistor which is this

104
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,370
enclosed in a big housing you could

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,180
drive over this with a truck

106
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,329
so for rugged places and direct burial

107
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,500
and soils this ceramic sheath thermistor

108
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:28,099
is a good choice

109
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:30,870
but what we're down to is the misters

110
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:36,240
particularly through misters that are

111
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:39,240
epoxy coated to nearly eliminate water

112
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,910
infiltration into the sensor that's what

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,210
kills sensors is when water gets into

114
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,110
them and the only two things that water

115
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:51,149
isn't get through our metal and glass

116
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,669
epoxy though is clothes the right kinds

117
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:56,599
of epoxy are almost as impermeable as

118
00:05:53,668 --> 00:06:00,529
glass so this one has got a special

119
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,860
epoxy coating to make it water

120
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:09,288
impermeable and as a result of that

121
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:12,270
potentially very stable so we've got

122
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:15,389
thermocouples thermistors and PRTs as

123
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,879
the categories PR T's have long been

124
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,728
considered the gold standard but they

125
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:25,589
have a couple of disadvantages they're

126
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:29,490
big they're expensive and they take up a

127
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:33,869
lot of data logger channels let's take a

128
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:36,629
look at the effective size in this small

129
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,550
is better but boy these are still pretty

130
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:42,810
small as far as temperatures

131
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:47,189
sisqÃ³ so this next slide shows us the

132
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,439
effect of size on temperature rise so

133
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,660
we've got these are all thermocouples

134
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,790
now so we take the same measurement

135
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,570
technology and make it in different

136
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,670
sizes now look at the wire diameter

137
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:02,399
these are down here thinner than a human

138
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,819
hair in this part of the graph these are

139
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,729
all tenths of a millimeter small and

140
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,310
very small we've put these in a

141
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:15,360
controlled environment with typical

142
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:18,060
radiation loads on them and look at the

143
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,370
increase in temperature this is the

144
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,009
difference between the true air

145
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,540
temperature and what the sensor gave us

146
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:30,029
look at this

147
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:33,240
8 degrees C errors with big sensors in

148
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:39,569
low wind speeds this number over here U

149
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:42,840
is wind speed right there so these are

150
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:48,389
all fairly low wind speeds but they

151
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:51,469
occur on calm days so this is high

152
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:54,629
radiation coming into it this is

153
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,400
intermediate radiation the point of this

154
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,290
whole slide is these errors are dark

155
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,649
gancho on e if you're trying to get

156
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,930
within a few tenths of a degree of the

157
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:07,469
correct air temperature you need to have

158
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,449
a very small sensor or make sure that

159
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,210
sensor doesn't see the sunlight directly

160
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,120
these were with no shielding and we'll

161
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:17,370
talk about that in another seminar that

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,970
the value and the importance of correct

163
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:25,889
shielding but for now small is better

164
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:30,300
the errors can be enormous so let's take

165
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:33,419
a look at PR T's all PRTs are not

166
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:37,460
created equal peoples all I've got a PRT

167
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:40,939
what kind of a PRT here's the five

168
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:45,509
classes of PR T's and their accuracy

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:48,200
specifications and plus or minus 1.2

170
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:51,840
degrees C that is not a very accurate

171
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,350
sensor but you can go we can go all the

172
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,920
way up

173
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:59,970
to one-tenth din which is an extremely

174
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:02,699
accurate PRT so you can see these vary a

175
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:09,389
lot and accuracy look at how much they

176
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:12,180
vary in cost one X - 15 X these are

177
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:15,899
great but they're very expensive and

178
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:20,789
we'll compare these two thermistors in

179
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:25,049
our in our next slide we have done tests

180
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:28,740
on these compared to this epoxy coated

181
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:32,129
semester that Apogee uses to measure air

182
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,100
temperature to see how good that is so

183
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:39,210
right here we're gonna do this

184
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,850
comparison of thermistors to this yellow

185
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:46,860
bead PRT and what we're going to compare

186
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:50,519
in the next few slides is Class A - mr.

187
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,250
so intermediate accuracy similar

188
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:57,539
advertised accuracy plus a minus 0.1

189
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:01,889
plus a minus point point one five 0.01

190
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:05,159
this is still more expensive but the

191
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:09,449
specified a cure is similar so what we

192
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:12,629
did in this test is took replica class a

193
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,240
PRT s and compared them to replica

194
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,850
thermistor 's and then we cycle them up

195
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,560
and down and up and down trying to make

196
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,240
them fail if something's going to go

197
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,519
wrong they've got to take this

198
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,370
accelerated aging test it was with high

199
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,699
humidity it was the worst possible

200
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,830
scenarios so really we can get 10 or 15

201
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,410
years of aging in just three or four

202
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,030
months by doing this but we want to know

203
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,659
these are going to be stable for the

204
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:44,039
long term so how'd this test come out

205
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:46,079
well first PRT accuracies they're not

206
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:50,279
equally accurate over the whole range

207
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,860
here's zero C right at freezing which is

208
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,889
their peak accuracy and as we deviate

209
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,470
from that these accuracies get greater

210
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:01,319
and again here's the the types of

211
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,950
thermistors and their accuracy here's a

212
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,960
picture of the PRT that Apogee

213
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,550
sells and we've got one right here -

214
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,129
real then you can do the size

215
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:12,979
comparisons

216
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:16,789
Appaji uses a shielded twisted-pair

217
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,379
cable this is also a four wire ohm

218
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:22,589
thermistor which we'll talk about in a

219
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,689
minute but they're for scale it's there

220
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,300
it is not on the screen right at my hand

221
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:30,360
by the way so here's the yellow bead

222
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,879
thermistor tiny yellow bead look at the

223
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,190
difference in size pretty close but the

224
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,259
yellow bead is smaller so if it's

225
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,280
smaller stays closer to the air

226
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:44,039
temperature so how this tests come out

227
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,759
after beating these things up bad giving

228
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:51,139
them 15 years one other key point before

229
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:54,659
I show you the test results a thermistor

230
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:58,379
because it has a big signal can be

231
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:04,379
measured with one single ended channel

232
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:09,809
one I'm going to put s e on here single

233
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:11,610
and a channel that's an inexpensive data

234
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:15,779
logger channel and we can do that

235
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:19,769
because it has a big signal CRTs have

236
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:23,100
such a tiny signal at the minimum we

237
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:27,360
need to take two channels here on the

238
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,100
data logger but for the best accuracy we

239
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,690
need to have two differential channels a

240
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,600
four wire system to get the best

241
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:39,060
accuracy not only is the sensor more

242
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,300
expensive but all those channels on the

243
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:45,629
data logger add cost to the system each

244
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:48,120
channel on a data logger can be several

245
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,820
hundred dollars and this takes four of

246
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,340
them compared to one up here

247
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,879
that's an overlooked cost in this thing

248
00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:04,530
is the cost of these channels all right

249
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:10,439
now what do these do here is 96 cycles

250
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:13,230
we went from minus 20 to plus 60 C 96

251
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,840
times up and down the thermistors are

252
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,269
shown here in blue the yellow beads the

253
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,540
pr keys are shown here

254
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:25,129
in red see if we can get rid of that

255
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:29,699
there we go these are shown here in red

256
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:32,490
here's the data the thermistors had a

257
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,970
slightly bigger error in the beginning

258
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,789
and you can see over the course of the

259
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:42,389
tests the number of cycles they drifted

260
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:44,969
more these are offset errors right here

261
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:46,830
so we can take those out and say okay if

262
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,670
they all read perfectly what would this

263
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,110
graph look like

264
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:53,579
so we normalize this then the

265
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:58,800
thermistors are rock-solid they're

266
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:02,220
better than the Class A PRTs so for less

267
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,588
money you can get greater accuracy with

268
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,290
this yellow bead thermistor it doesn't

269
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:10,800
mean all thermistors are better just one

270
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:14,189
just this one that has the epoxy coating

271
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:20,278
on it which is the one that Apogee has

272
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:22,380
selected to sell so now let's take a

273
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,289
look remember I said there was better

274
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:30,149
PRTs now let's take a look at some

275
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:34,799
one-tenth din PRTs how did they do these

276
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:39,690
are higher quality even more cycles 10

277
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:44,429
months 584 cycles up and down up and

278
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,899
down the class the one-tenth din PRTs

279
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:48,599
were much better this is rock-solid

280
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,659
these are the two replicates right here

281
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,089
those were rock-solid in this death so

282
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:58,649
it's possible to get good PRTs you just

283
00:14:54,089 --> 00:15:02,370
have to pay more for them so how did

284
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:05,120
these compared to the thermistors here's

285
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,980
12 replicas thermistors against those

286
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,649
584 cycles and we keep going we

287
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,879
normalize them to 0 here because there's

288
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:17,639
some offset and the errors are less than

289
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,759
five one hundredths of a degree C in

290
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,699
drift of these sensors over time so this

291
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,708
is a more comprehensive test that helped

292
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,560
convince us that these yellow bead

293
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:32,078
thermistors were just rock-solid so

294
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,328
let's look at an application how good do

295
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,628
you need air temperature and how would

296
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:40,958
these perform in a system in a severe

297
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:43,420
climate it turns out we're in Logan Utah

298
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,239
so we look out the window at mountains

299
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:49,719
that are 10,000 feet we're five little

300
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,028
under 5,000 feet in our Valley some of

301
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,819
those mountain climates have very severe

302
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:57,028
weather and one of the most famous for

303
00:15:54,818 --> 00:16:00,698
severe weather is a place called Peter

304
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:03,578
sinks it's in a little ball high up in

305
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:07,508
the mountains cold air collects in this

306
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:09,729
sink it gets extremely cold and it hot

307
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,399
in the summer cold inthere how cold does

308
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:16,509
it get look at this

309
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:19,328
1985 rerecorded - sixty nine point three

310
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:24,259
Fahrenheit up there - fifty six point

311
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:26,669
three see this record was the lowest

312
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:29,220
temperature for Utah the record all-time

313
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:31,019
low and it was the second coldest

314
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,519
temperature ever recorded in the

315
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,990
continental United States

316
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:40,470
oh great second how what was the coldest

317
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:44,460
Rodgers pass in Montana sixty nine point

318
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,950
seven Fahrenheit this is 1954 so these

319
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:51,120
are long-term records look at the

320
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,620
difference here's our second-place minus

321
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,139
sixty nine point three

322
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,179
there's the all-time record sixty nine

323
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,419
point seven you tell me how much

324
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:03,329
accuracy of sensors matters and extreme

325
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:05,430
cases when that we got second place by

326
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:09,350
four tenths of a degree Fahrenheit

327
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,910
that's two tenths of a degree Celsius

328
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,929
measurements matter when you're going

329
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,000
for an all-time record so at this site

330
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,789
we have set up a weather station that

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,430
continuously records temperatures and

332
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,710
we've done test runs with the apogee

333
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,640
sensors up here to see how they do let's

334
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:31,289
take a look at that site here's the site

335
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,240
this is practically summer up there

336
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:35,460
right if the snow really does melt off

337
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:43,289
in this summer but it's it's a remote

338
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:46,319
steer site right here is a multi-plate

339
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:50,789
shield that they're commonly used on

340
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:54,329
these and then here is the apogee

341
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:57,629
aspirated shield so what we're going to

342
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:59,759
look at is just the shield now and we're

343
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,890
going to take a look right up the bottom

344
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,079
of this like we're laying on the snow

345
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,300
looking at the bottom this is what the

346
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:10,109
bottom looks like and this is the

347
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:15,269
sensors inside of here two yellow beads

348
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:17,339
and two PRTs both in the same shield so

349
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:20,000
we can do a rigorous replicate

350
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:23,819
comparison of accuracy and stability

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,829
over a long term in this because they're

352
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:30,599
both fan aspirated they should both be

353
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:33,569
accurate how'd they do well first of all

354
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,759
how severe was the weather this is a

355
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:38,579
year almost a year of weather

356
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:41,160
up and down day and night day and night

357
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:43,859
this has huge swings hot in the day cold

358
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,810
at night here's last winter is two

359
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:48,000
winters ago we didn't get the all-time

360
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:51,299
record right we got to almost to minus

361
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,269
40 degrees C remember the all-time

362
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,460
record is minus 56 but it still got cold

363
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,619
in up and down then finally summer came

364
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,410
and it's not many nights it doesn't

365
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:04,709
freeze up there that's it's it's a cold

366
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:07,529
place but these swings are enormous so

367
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,880
it's sensors should get a beating up

368
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:14,879
there what's the data look like here's

369
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,740
that same graph with cycling temperature

370
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,370
difference between the two replicas

371
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,250
thermistors look at the scale on this

372
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:25,919
plus a minus one see right on top of

373
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:29,910
each other here's the PRTs they're also

374
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,940
very good plus or minus zero now focus

375
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:36,120
in on this right here this little spike

376
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,460
has happened in the spring this is

377
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,189
classic when it happens when a speck of

378
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,980
moisture gets in there could have been

379
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,799
even an insect and it got on one of the

380
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,420
sensors and cooled it off and sources

381
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,149
the average of the two and it's only

382
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,980
it's less than 1 degree C but this is

383
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,900
not measurement error this is just

384
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,990
something momentarily getting in the

385
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,670
shield and cooling off the sensor you

386
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,799
can imagine if you put an ice cube on a

387
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,380
sensor for a fraction of a second you'd

388
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,480
easily get that even a wet sponge would

389
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,520
easily get them right to 0 so that we're

390
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,440
not worried about that what we're

391
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,730
worried about is this stability and

392
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,830
let's zoom in on this just a bit now

393
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,170
just those two graphs big even a

394
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:23,039
narrower scale plus a minus point 4

395
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:25,470
degrees C the the replica thermistors

396
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,470
are very close to each other the replica

397
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,230
PRPs are close to each other these are

398
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:35,130
differences from the mean of all four

399
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:38,759
sensors so nobody was off by more than

400
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:42,810
about 0.1 and they were rock-solid over

401
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:45,420
this down your period of this test the

402
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:48,558
thermistors were every bit as good as

403
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,600
the pr T's for stability

404
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,109
but there's one other concern remember

405
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,628
we talked about small is better and the

406
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:59,839
smaller the sensor the closer it stays

407
00:20:56,628 --> 00:21:04,898
to air temperature these are smaller

408
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:07,509
than these it's a round end remember are

409
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:11,628
not in our Show and Tell here

410
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:15,169
that's not much difference in size but

411
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:16,609
if the sun is shining on these this big

412
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:19,970
stainless steel one's going to heat up

413
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:23,178
more than that tiny little feet but

414
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:26,210
these are also inside a aspirated shield

415
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:28,999
so the Sun shouldn't matter but what

416
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:32,240
happened the some reflected light

417
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:37,038
bounced off the snow and heated these up

418
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,769
inside the screen and here's what

419
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:44,210
happened compared to the mean of the

420
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:46,759
thermistors the PRTs heated up from

421
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,100
solar radiation wasn't big it was 0.1

422
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:55,329
degrees C but because they were bigger

423
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:57,558
they were less accurate so this is two

424
00:21:55,329 --> 00:22:00,339
examples of the same thing the to

425
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:05,329
replicate PRTs both of them heated up

426
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:08,209
this is why we really recommend using

427
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:10,519
this Apogee yellow bead thermistor in

428
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:13,909
these applications even inside of an

429
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:18,048
aspirated shield where they're protected

430
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:21,440
it saves a lot of money if you really

431
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:23,690
need good accuracy put in two replicas

432
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,580
yellow beads and if they only read the

433
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,369
same you need to go out and check the

434
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:31,038
site you've got a problem so to end to

435
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:34,849
replica yellow beads is far less

436
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:38,839
expensive than one more expensive PRT

437
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:41,859
here's the setup right here so with that

438
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:45,109
we're going to conclude this session on

439
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:47,269
temperature sensors and we'll follow up

440
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:49,668
on temperature shields in another talk

441
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:52,058
thanks for listening we'll see you again

442
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:52,059
soon
