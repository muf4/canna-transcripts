00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:09,765
Today we're excited to bring you the results of some new research we've done here in the Crop Physiology Lab.

2
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:19,630
We're going to talk about light pollution and how sensitive cannabis is to very low levels of light.

3
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:25,994
Now, right out of the gate, I can tell you that our research shows that it is extremely sensitive,

4
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:29,928
but it is not as sensitive as most people think.

5
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:34,893
We're going to show you how to measure the light and interpret the data.

6
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:40,092
One of the terms that we have use is reagent-grade darkness.

7
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:46,358
Our laboratories are full of reagent-grade chemicals, which means they're very pure.

8
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:51,256
But the contaminants aren't really zero, they're just extremely low contaminants.

9
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:53,323
That's what reagent-grade means.

10
00:00:53,323 --> 00:01:03,420
In the case of darkness, how dark is dark? Can we really get to zero if we really count photons?

11
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,254
We're going to talk about that.

12
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:10,087
What are the tolerance limits for cannabis? Let's take a look at this.

13
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:14,519
The people who are doing the work on this are Paul Kusuma,

14
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,118
who has been in this lab for five years doing a PhD,

15
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:29,082
and we're proud to announce last week he finished and now he's a post-doctoral fellow at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.

16
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:35,515
He did a lot of this work. And also Mitchell Westmoreland, who you know because he's given you lots of lectures.

17
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:39,980
These two guys have been taking careful measurements of multiple species,

18
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,845
we're not just testing cannabis, but some other crop plants.

19
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:52,478
When we take a look at this, look at this titleâ€”no problem seeing this title against a black background.

20
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:57,343
But now, when the sun starts to come up, this is early dawn,

21
00:01:57,343 --> 00:02:01,609
how many nanomoles of lights is this? It's getting brighter, the sun's getting brighter.

22
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:05,509
At what point do plants detect it's bright?

23
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:12,074
And this is still night, but this is light pollution, and now you can't even read the title because of the light pollution.

24
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:21,306
This is a big deal. Neighbors worldwide complain about our greenhouses polluting their neighborhoods with light.

25
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:31,304
But, this is a two-edged sword because their yard lights and security lights pollute our greenhouses with light.

26
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:41,169
We need to understand and be able to measure these low light levels, so we can see when we're getting into trouble with this.

27
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:52,033
There is a dark sky organization, darksky.org, that studies the effects of very low levels of light on a wide range of species.

28
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,165
Lots of stories of turtles getting confused by light pollution.

29
00:02:56,165 --> 00:03:05,163
It turns out there's good evidence that many of the wildlife in our national parks are more sensitive to light than our plants are.

30
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:10,362
Some people can sleep with lights on, some people have to have it completely dark.

31
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:16,461
There's all kinds of interactions with reagent-grade darkness and biology.

32
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:24,393
Here's our license plate, Delicate Arch in Arches National Park. It's a source of great national pride here in Utah.

33
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:28,359
Now this is artificially lit up to get this photograph, but guess what?

34
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:34,425
See this aurora back here? That's the city of Moab in the background with light pollution to the sky.

35
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:37,391
These are common kinds of slides.

36
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:43,022
This would have been taken with a very long shutter speed, so we can see the starlight.

37
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:53,887
So our instruments now need the equivalent of a very long shutter speed to rigorously quantify these very trace levels of light.

38
00:03:53,887 --> 00:04:07,651
You can go back in the literature to see what other studies have been done, and that's something we try to do. Good scholarship.

39
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:21,615
If you look for cannabis, you get to a book by Daphne Vince-Prue, 1975. The sensitivity of seven plants to light pollution.

40
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:28,480
Now threshold value for an inhibition of flowering. That's exactly what we're interesting in.

41
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,713
Here's the seven species. Even back then, they were studying cannabis.

42
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:42,478
Not because of anything of medicinal value. It was an interesting botanical species that was sensitive to low light.

43
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,477
These numbers are in lux, but they range from 0.1 to 21.5.

44
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:54,141
So that's a huge range and these are all species that are sensitive to light.

45
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:57,007
Here's the original references they came from.

46
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:01,073
This book is a great piece of research on this.

47
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:09,639
And I want to thank Royal Heins for doing some of the early scholarship on this to find this table.

48
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:18,137
Now, let's convert from lux to micromoles per meter squared per second of photons.

49
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:22,636
Because it's not lux that triggers this, it's numbers of photons.

50
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:32,435
And assuming this is reflected sunlight off the moon, we can make a conversion to units that we're more familiar with.

51
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:38,600
And here it is. Same species, but now micromoles per meter squared per second.

52
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,599
The first thing you see is all these numbers are below one.

53
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:46,497
Now remember full sun is like 2,000,

54
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:49,663
so this is low, low levels of light.

55
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:54,862
Most normal meters have trouble even measuring this low level.

56
00:05:54,862 --> 00:06:02,228
Garden mums are real common commercial crop. We pull black cloth on garden mums to get them dark enough.

57
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:07,327
But kalenchoe and other floriculture species. Look at poinsettia.

58
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:14,825
We have long considered poinsettia to  be our most sensitive commercial species to light pollution.

59
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:25,724
And in fact, based on this data, it is. It's four times more sensitive than mums and kalanchoe for 0.1 micromoles.

60
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,990
Morning glory, not a commercial species.

61
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:40,888
Cannabis, wow. Based on this data, 1975, that's far more sensitive than even poinsettias to light pollution.

62
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:47,985
Soybeans are also really sensitive, but this gives me the chance to point out that we've studies soybeans a lot,

63
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:57,317
and over the decades of repeated breeding of soybeans, the sensitivity of soybeans to low light has been breed out of them.

64
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:08,181
Our modern cultivars of soybeans can tolerate a lot more light pollution than their early predecessors of 50 years ago or more.

65
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:14,914
So it shows you that you can use breeding to shift the sensitivity to light pollution.

66
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:19,447
But that's a lot of breeding and right now we deal with this.

67
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:26,612
How do these levels compare to what we get from a full moon?

68
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:33,244
A full moon is very bright. You walk outside with a full moon on a clear night and, wow, it seems really bright.

69
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:37,843
Let's take a look at what full moon is.

70
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:46,841
This is a study we did in 2018 with some precision sensors on the roof of Apogee Instruments.

71
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:52,240
Clear sky. Moon rise, we got to a peak, moon set.

72
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,139
The peak was 1.6 nanomoles.

73
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:08,604
Here's 0.16 nanomoles over here. Let's get the pen on here, dark blue.

74
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,603
0.16.

75
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:20,334
This would be 0.0016 micromoles per meter squared per second.

76
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:29,032
As we get into this business, we have to shift our thinking from micromoles to nanomoles because the light levels get so low.

77
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:34,197
So here's that graph, just against a dark sky.

78
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:43,129
That's a picture of the Apogee light pollution detector people are using now to detect these nanomoles of light pollution.

79
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:49,562
So let's go back with that 0.0016 to our original graph and now we can put that on there.

80
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:58,094
Now we round that up to 0.002. If it's a harvest moon, some things can make the moon extra bright.

81
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:00,693
So instead of 0.0016, rounded to 0.002.

82
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:05,192
But look. These levels are almost as high as that.

83
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:14,923
0.006 is three times as high as the full moon, but it's close to the full moon causing a problem.

84
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:27,355
This data is from these references reported in 1975. That means all these studies were in the 1950s and 1960s on these crops.

85
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:29,355
How good is this data?

86
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:41,985
Fortunately, Jim Faust at Clemson University has recently done very rigorous studies on the effect of light pollution in poinsettia.

87
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:49,917
So before we look at cannabis, let's see how good his data is for poinsettia.

88
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:54,849
Here's his studies. This is Professor Faust looking at his crop.

89
00:09:54,849 --> 00:10:02,348
This is a light gradient study, so down here it was very dark. The poinsettia bracts turned red like they should.

90
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:07,079
But as you got to more light over here, there's light pollution.

91
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,146
And these are intermediate levels of light in his study.

92
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:15,577
So he repeated this several times on several cultivars.

93
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:18,577
Here's his data.

94
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:24,610
First of all, micromoles. And this is days to anthesis.

95
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:33,341
So, this line right here means they turned red quickly up to this point,

96
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:38,874
and then as the light pollution got worse, it took longer and longer.

97
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:47,404
Up at this point over here, it took over 100 days to turn red. This is a serious problem with light pollution.

98
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:58,370
If we put some data on here, 0.04. Now rememberâ€”let's put it up hereâ€”this is 40 nanomoles.

99
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,601
40 nanomoles, the poinsettias started to detect this.

100
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:07,034
These dots are two different poinsettia cultivars.

101
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:13,333
In his work he didn't see species variability in poinsettia.

102
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:18,665
So anything below that is dark. Anything below 40 nanomoles.

103
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:27,564
Now remember, full moon was 2 nanomoles, so full moon is way down here on this graph.

104
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:37,728
Up here, 0.4, so that is 400 nanomoles.

105
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:42,427
And that completely inhibited the crops.

106
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:47,993
So let's keep track of this number, this is where the line starts to change direction.

107
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:52,026
Go back to our screen.

108
00:11:52,025 --> 00:12:01,123
1975, this number is 100 nanomoles.

109
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:09,288
Jim Faust found they started to detect light pollution at 40 nanomoles.

110
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:17,288
So what he found was they were even more sensitive than those early studies.

111
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:20,620
40 is a lower number than 100.

112
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,985
So how about cannabis?

113
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:29,585
That's coming in close to full moon. Could cannabis detect the full moon?

114
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:36,716
We set out to study that. We've done replicate studies now with cannabis, with precision levels of light pollution.

115
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:45,914
When we do these studies, we turn the light pollution on. It's tiny LEDs, and we run it continuously through the night.

116
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:47,980
Here's the data.

117
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,913
Nanomoles, here's 40.

118
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:58,178
Now this is the level that would start to affect poinsettias.

119
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,778
And that took more than that, but look at this.

120
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:09,509
This is flower diameter, so 100 means they got big flowers quickly.

121
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:18,475
As we increased the light pollution up to 10, no effect. Neither Trump nor Cherry, two cultivars.

122
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:26,041
Cherry was more sensitive than Trump. As we went to 20, we saw the flowers are just smaller.

123
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:31,040
Now the plants were fine, the flowers just developed more slowly.

124
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,738
And quite a bit more slowly, that's half of this and it only took 20 nanomoles.

125
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:42,304
Trump is a little more tolerant, that took a little bit longer to fill out.

126
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:56,168
But based on this data, we now conclude that 10 nanomoles or lower is dark enough so that we don't get an effect on flowering in cannabis.

127
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:03,000
Remember our reference? Full moon is 2? Here's our full moon reference here.

128
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:14,130
Even the full moon is not even close to bright enough to trigger an issue in flowering in cannabis.

129
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,697
That's a key thing.

130
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:24,363
Now, to help you get a sense of light levels and what full moon light really is,

131
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:30,795
we're going to do a little experiment here in the lab to show you light levels.

132
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:38,959
And let's start withâ€”this is a standard light meter that we would use to measure light for crops.

133
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:47,458
Sunlight goes to 2,000. You probably can't read this here, but can we read that here if I put it out? 11.

134
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:52,624
This is a well lit office. We've got lights in here, so every things is well lit.

135
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:58,922
So what if we turn this to the floor like that?

136
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:03,654
I'm already getting zero turning it down here.

137
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:11,052
But again, we're talking nanomoles, which are below detectable limits on this meter.

138
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:21,018
So what we're going to do now is turn the lights out and show you what nanomoles look like.

139
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:26,484
Here's an important rule of thumb, and I hope you remember this.

140
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:31,283
If you take a book, even with large print,

141
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:38,581
out in the night on the full moon, the brightest full moon, the pie in the sky, very clear skies,

142
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:41,195
take it out and try and read the book.

143
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:46,446
And I brought "Charlotte's Web," a children's book, because it's got big print. Easy to read here.

144
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:55,011
On a night with full moon, even with a dark-adapted eye, you cannot read the print in a book.

145
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:03,809
So if your greenhouse is so dark you can't read a book with big print, you're still okay. It's not going to trigger the cannabis.

146
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:09,907
If you have one LED in the corner, it's not enough to read a book. It's not going to trigger the cannabis.

147
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:18,440
This is a nice rule of thumb for how dark you are in a greenhouse or dark room facility.

148
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,072
Now let's try some experiments here. Let's turn out these lights and measure nanomoles.

149
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:33,203
So here we are with all of our studio lights turned off, but with a dimmable LED in the back of the room.

150
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:41,968
When we took our standard light meter to do this, there's light enough to shoot this video.

151
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:52,033
It's zeroes, it's some number less than one. It's clearly not really zero, it's just too low to detect with the standard light meter.

152
00:16:52,033 --> 00:17:00,664
So we go to our light pollution detector, which is a thousand times more sensitive and reads out in nanomoles.

153
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:04,197
This has Bluetooth, so it's reading on my phone right here.

154
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:09,763
If I hold this here, I'm getting 70 nanomoles.

155
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:15,794
Now this is plenty of light pollution to cause problems, at least with cannabis.

156
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:22,693
And if I take my "Charlotte's Web" book, I have no problem reading at all with this.

157
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,094
But now, what if we go darker?

158
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:30,625
And we're going to try to get this even less.

159
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:38,423
Now we've reduced this to 37 nanomoles.

160
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:47,821
This is still enough light pollution to cause problems, and I can still read my book without a problem.

161
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:53,587
I might have to wait now to let my eyes adapt, but I can still read the book.

162
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:57,386
Let's see if we can get it even darker.

163
00:17:57,386 --> 00:18:02,586
Now we're down 17... 13...

164
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:05,318
9... 7.

165
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:10,783
Alright, now we're down at a light level that cannabis wouldn't detect.

166
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:18,416
And now I'm going to even turn this down. We're at 4 nanomoles.

167
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:26,414
Cannabis wouldn't detect this. I look at the book and if I let my eyes adapt,

168
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:34,546
I can just barely read this book in this light at 4 nanomoles of light.

169
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,912
In fact, I wouldn't want to read this. Oh wow.

170
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:50,976
I have to have dark-adapted eyes to see the print, but this is 4 nanomoles measured with this.

171
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:55,309
And this is pointed right at the light source.

172
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:58,942
This gives you a sense of how dark is dark.

173
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,941
Now, we'll bring the light up a little bit.

174
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:06,307
Look at this, 40 nanomoles.

175
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,073
70 nanomoles.

176
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:13,605
These are light levels that would trigger problems, but this is a lot of light.

177
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:19,171
Now you can read this thing, you can read this thing from your computer screen where you're sitting.

178
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:24,136
And all we're giving isâ€”now we're going down, let's hold this up here.

179
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:31,068
There's 60 nanomoles, going down 40 nanomoles.

180
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:34,634
There's 20 nanomoles.

181
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:38,767
13 nanomoles.

182
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,900
10 nanomoles.

183
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,566
I can still read the book.

184
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,399
7.

185
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,464
This is the kind of light pollution we're talking about.

186
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:57,762
See that little red LED there? There's no way that's enough to cause a problem with cannabis flowering.

187
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,295
It needs to be brighter than it seems.

188
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:05,194
The bottom line is our eyes are exquisitely sensitive to low light.

189
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:10,461
Our irises open up, we can detect light pollution extremely well,

190
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:15,226
but you have to measure it to see if you have a problem with cannabis.

191
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,659
Now let's go back to full light.

192
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:20,625
So, we're back to full light in the studio.

193
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:28,156
All of these tests we were able to run the light all the way up to 50 and above and back down here.

194
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:40,355
But you can see, once again, this zone right here below 10 is what we consider safe for cannabis.

195
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:46,019
And again, our eyes are so sensitive, we can detect 1, 2, 3, 4 down here.

196
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:52,519
But you have to measure it. You can have light pollution in one spot and ten feet away is not enough to matter.

197
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,285
So one crack of light could affect one plant.

198
00:20:56,285 --> 00:21:05,583
If you see strange things happening with a plant in the corner, it doesn't necessarily mean it was light pollution.

199
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:12,115
It could be temperature, it could be something else. Once again, you've got to measure the light.

200
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:16,248
So, back to this. Full moon.

201
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:27,446
Our data here suggests this would be 6 nanomoles from 1975.

202
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:38,876
Our data indicate that this number is closer to 10 for the most sensitive species detecting light.

203
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:45,075
So, one other thing we have done is interactions with temperature.

204
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:51,641
What we have found, I'm not going to go into this in detail, but this is nanomoles of light pollution.

205
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:57,140
The slope of the line is steeper for cool night temperatures.

206
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,605
That means there's an interaction with night temperature.

207
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:08,604
Plants appear to be more sensitive to light pollution when the nights are cooler than when they're warm.

208
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:14,869
This is an area of active study, and I don't think this is going to wildly shift the data,

209
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:22,300
but it might shift it from 10 down to 7 for detection limits, if the nights are cool.

210
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,134
Now the average cannabis is somewhere right in the middle here.

211
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:34,365
It's neither a warm nightâ€”the warm nights in this, I think, were 28 degrees and the cool nights were 20 Celsius.

212
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:38,597
So, somewhere in the 80s and the 60s at night.

213
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:43,196
This was a big range, but it might interact with temperature.

214
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:46,729
And finally, how does it interact with color?

215
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,295
All of our studies were done with pure red light, which is the most potent source of light

216
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:56,361
for phytochrome and for triggering light responses.

217
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:59,994
That's why we're comfortable saying 10 is a safe limit.

218
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:07,058
This is a study of the growth of the flowers with time after the start of short days.

219
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,291
We took a micrometer and measured the flowers.

220
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:14,523
Now the first thing you want to look at is the control. Completely dark.

221
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:17,623
And the flowers got big at this rate.

222
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:25,788
Look at blue light. Blue light, at the same intensity as all the others, had no effect on the plants.

223
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:32,987
It's remarkable. We know that red has an effect, but in this study, look at green light.

224
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:37,653
Green light was just as potent as red light for the plants.

225
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:42,485
We say green lights are safe lights for plants.

226
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:49,050
In this study, the green light was just as potent as red light. Why is that?

227
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,750
This is a picture of a cross section of a leaf.

228
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:58,281
Here's the top. Here's the bottom of that leaf.

229
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:04,513
Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red very efficiently, so those colors don't penetrate.

230
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:11,612
But chlorophyll reflects green, and the green hits and penetrates deep into the leaf,

231
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:18,077
and this is part of the reason that green light is not as safe as we might think.

232
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:24,010
Now, don't go out here running around saying, "Dr. Bugbee says that green light is not safe at all."

233
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:32,475
Our eyes are so sensitive to green, we can see plants with 1/100 the amount of green light as we can with blue or red.

234
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:37,208
If you've got to have a light, it's still the best color of light.

235
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,240
But, it is not completely safe.

236
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,006
Some outfits have green lights on at night. That's a bad idea. You shouldn't have any lights on at night.

237
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:49,939
It's still difficult.

238
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:51,837
So it interacts with color.

239
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:54,305
We're looking at what we call reciprocity.

240
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:58,836
What if we give the plants a bright flash versus a low steady level?

241
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:01,869
Are they the same thing? We're studying it.

242
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:10,634
In some other crops there is reciprocity. It is related to the cumulative dose of light at night.

243
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:19,766
Really, we talk about daily light integral, we should now be talking about night light integral for light pollution.

244
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:23,832
All of our studies were done with steady state light pollution.

245
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:31,064
And we're starting to study what happens if we give them bright light for a short period of time.

246
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:37,763
Lot of interesting stuff. It's a new frontier and cannabis is a wonderful botanical species for this,

247
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:44,461
because it is so sensitive to low levels of light at night.

248
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:54,625
This stuff, this work, led to this paper by Paul Kusuma, published in Frontiers in Plant Science.

249
00:25:54,625 --> 00:26:02,391
"Improving the predictive value of phytochrome photoequilibrium: Consideration of spectral distortion within a leaf."

250
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:07,190
What we have found is our prediction of phytochrome needs to change too because,

251
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,256
again, green light penetrating leaves so effectively.

252
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:18,653
Phytochrome is the molecule that triggers plants to get tall and short. Triggers perception of shade.

253
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:26,752
And our understanding of how colors affect that has been inadequate in the past.

254
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:36,150
One important consideration in all this is, does light pollution cause hermaphrodites and hermaphroditic flowers?

255
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:45,149
There's a lot of observations suggesting that it does and there's certainly the potential for that.

256
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:51,347
It's a statistical thing, it's not black and white.

257
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:57,379
But again, if you're in the safe zone, we don't have any evidence that it causes hermaphroditic flowers.

258
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,946
That's a very interesting question, a lot of things affect hermaphrodism. Genetics is a big one.

259
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:10,110
We're actively studying that and we'll talk more about that in another episode.

260
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,377
One final thought.

261
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:19,642
This is human vision and how our perception of color changes as the light gets dimmer.

262
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:29,974
We talk about the photopic curve and that means how we see colors of light when an area is well lit.

263
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:35,005
And the peak here is right in the middle of the green light and look at green lights.

264
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:42,638
At least 10 times more sensitive than red and blue light, but look what happens when the lights dim.

265
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:48,936
Our rods and cones adjust and this is called the Purkinje Effect.

266
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:54,235
And this shifts and it's called the scotopic curve in low light.

267
00:27:54,236 --> 00:28:00,934
And now we can see blues and greens better, but look at the reds. This is the reds here.

268
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:05,332
We can't see red colors in low light.

269
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:14,731
Here's a geranium flower. We can see it fine. Low light it's less red, and even lower light you see the flower, but it's gray.

270
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:17,730
That's just a function of shifting.

271
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,663
I put this slide in here because I think we're going to see something like this for plants.

272
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:28,461
They perceive colors differently in very low light than they do in high light.

273
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:33,827
This is some of the cutting edge research that we're doing on light pollution now.

274
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:39,593
So, stay tuned, we'll keep publishing papers and share the results with you.

275
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:48,658
But for now, measure the light so you're into the safe threshold when you're growing cannabis.

276
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:52,256
We'll talk to you in the next episode.
