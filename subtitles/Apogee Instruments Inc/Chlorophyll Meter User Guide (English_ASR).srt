1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,889
well my name is Skyler Smith here at

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,290
Apogee instruments and today we're going

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:08,879
to talk about the MC 100 we're gonna do

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,189
a demonstration with it we're going to

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,589
talk about how to take measurements with

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,689
it how to save samples how to read the

7
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,640
different units the CCIE units the SPAD

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:20,070
units and the micro moles per meter

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,170
squared of chlorophyll depending on

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,350
specific species and then also a generic

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,570
species we have for that how to change

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,160
the meter to read for those and then how

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,990
to get all the save data off the meter

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,000
onto the computer and we're going to

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,960
briefly touch on if you want to add the

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,378
GPS module as an add-on feature so to do

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,429
that we do need the overhead camera so

18
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:42,988
we're just gonna change that

19
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,289
so that'll just take a second to come up

20
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:49,169
here as that comes up you can see right

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,260
here in front of us we have the MC 100

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,939
here's the full unit okay and we're

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,899
zoomed in tight so we can see the screen

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,390
because we're going to go through the

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,789
settings on it so first thing we're

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,448
gonna hit power it's going to beep and

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,549
that's how we know it is on we see three

28
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:08,188
things right off the bat we see run data

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,610
and save and then we see our time and

30
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:13,408
date stamp up here now if this is not

31
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,489
correct you want to change this then the

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,700
first thing you want to click on is

33
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:20,789
system and then you want to go to setup

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,490
and then it's going to tell us our time

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,409
date and the format it's in if we want

36
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:28,949
to edit that right there and then as a

37
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:35,939
note this is a 24 hour clock so we'll go

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:38,400
ahead and hit exit there now we first we

39
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,289
want to set this up we need to first set

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,109
up how we want to save the files and

41
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,280
then we want to set up how many averages

42
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:46,739
we're going to take and then we're going

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,590
to set up the units so first thing how

44
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:54,149
do we set up the files so we go to run

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,219
and then we go to setup and the first

46
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,040
thing that comes up is save data and

47
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:02,459
data file well let's go ahead and edit

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,100
that so we hit edit and then when yes is

49
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,780
highlighted so we want to save data yes

50
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,609
but maybe you want to rename that data

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,459
file or change it to something else or

52
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,740
understand why it came up with that so

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,170
if we hit over it comes up with the

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,060
file name manager now right now it says

55
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,119
use existing file well we don't want to

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,879
do that we don't have any files on here

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,259
next is enter a new name if we wanted to

58
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,669
just go ahead and type out a new name we

59
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:33,389
could do that there next is edit a

60
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:35,669
default name and then the last one is

61
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,799
used date as a name so for our example

62
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,539
we're going to go ahead and use the date

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,450
as the name so let's accept that and

64
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,599
then it comes up with this and we have

65
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,250
the year first followed by the month

66
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:50,250
followed by the day followed by the hour

67
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,629
and so this looks perfect it's how we

68
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,090
want to save for our demonstration day

69
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,669
so we're going to hit accept

70
00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:00,330
all right so we have all of that set up

71
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:02,699
our file name the next thing is if we

72
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,820
want to do averaging so there are three

73
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,119
different test measurement ways you can

74
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,060
do it

75
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,340
you can do it in multi-point average as

76
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,530
it's showing right now you can do it in

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,319
one point no averaging and you can do

78
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,479
multi-point standard deviation so let's

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,849
start by talking about one point no

80
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,429
averaging this means that every time

81
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:26,129
that you take a measurement on a leaf

82
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,140
that it's just saving every measurement

83
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,150
every time you point is just taking your

84
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,309
measurement it's not doing any averaging

85
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,010
for you and so this average number of

86
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,360
points and recorded point data they do

87
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:41,759
not apply in that in that feature

88
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,590
multi-point standard deviation and this

89
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,500
one it will take your standard deviation

90
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,300
as an average of between 10 and 30

91
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,879
readings so you have to change this

92
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,790
number of a point to between 10 and 30

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,689
now on this last one record point data

94
00:03:53,789 --> 00:04:00,090
if you have this in no right here then

95
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,150
it means that it is only going to save

96
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,060
your standard deviations your your

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,520
average standard standard deviation if

98
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,580
it's in yes it's going to save every

99
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,050
individual point as you measure and as

100
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,230
well as that it's going to save your

101
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:19,040
your average standard deviations now as

102
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,080
a note on that feature if for any reason

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,000
your measurements are different are

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,879
larger than two times the standard

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,480
deviation then the instrument itself is

106
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,569
going to throw

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,189
that outlier and cause you to take

108
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,569
another measurement asked you to take

109
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,939
another measurement so just be aware of

110
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:39,180
that if that happens to you so in our

111
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:41,550
example let's do multi-point averaging

112
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,079
okay so it's and it's going to do

113
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,930
multi-point averaging it's going to ask

114
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:49,109
you how many points to average and then

115
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,720
record point data on the record point

116
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,689
data if you put no it's only going to

117
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,250
record the averages for you and if you

118
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,689
put yes it's going to record every

119
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,620
single point when you take a measurement

120
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:07,170
as well as the averages so if we click

121
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:09,180
enter here and then if we click over it

122
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,910
will ask us the average number of points

123
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,500
we can push up or down here to get the

124
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,710
average number of points higher or lower

125
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,930
for our example today 3 is fine and then

126
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,199
record point data yes that is fine as

127
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,389
well

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:28,500
so we can just hit enter next on the

129
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:31,740
menu is this data echo output as off and

130
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,370
GPS data logging off so the data echo

131
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,530
output refers to the rs-232 which is the

132
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,290
port on the bottom of the sensor you can

133
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:43,409
see it right here and so if you had an

134
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,000
rs-232 to a serial cable and you wanted

135
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,490
it to be sending data out through that

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,089
as well as logging data on the unit

137
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,310
itself you would have that on and then

138
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,929
you'd have that set up if for more

139
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,209
details on that just contact us here at

140
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,970
tech support and then same on the second

141
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:03,239
one the GPS data logging you would also

142
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,370
plug in to that same q 32 port some sort

143
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,590
of GPS module and then you'd be and then

144
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,629
you'd click on on this menu and then

145
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:11,489
you'd have that set up so again for more

146
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,839
details on that just contact us here and

147
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,269
we'll tell you what we have found that

148
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:20,939
has worked for us next use custom

149
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:23,219
measurements so what it's asking us here

150
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,350
is what is the unit that we want to read

151
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,660
our chlorophyll in we talked about we

152
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,910
have CCI units we have Spade units and

153
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,030
then we have units of chlorophyll in

154
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,460
terms of micro moles per meter squared

155
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:38,729
so when it says use custom measurement

156
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:41,409
it says know right now that means saying

157
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,740
no means it is in CCI unit

158
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,570
so for our example let's go ahead and

159
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,370
start with doing it in terms of

160
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:52,209
chlorophyll of micro moles per meter

161
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:57,370
squared and for our example let us pull

162
00:06:52,209 --> 00:07:00,370
up our heart leaf IV our little

163
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,199
philodendron core datum here and so we

164
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,840
want to do some chlorophyll readings off

165
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,060
of him and let's start by doing generic

166
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:13,119
readings first the generic chlorophyll

167
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:15,639
table so to change this we go to edit we

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,920
change that to yes and then when I push

169
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,810
the side button it's going to ask us

170
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,360
which one and these are all the custom

171
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,139
tables it comes loaded with but since

172
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,210
philodendron core datum is not listed in

173
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,180
here we just want the generic so we'll

174
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:33,849
go ahead and hit generic hit OK accept

175
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,189
and now it's saying use custom units yes

176
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,110
use generic all right

177
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,689
so we are all set we are ready to start

178
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,750
taking measurements so we click measure

179
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:46,240
and it says clear sample area and hold

180
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,879
down the arm so we will go ahead and

181
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:55,660
just hold down the arm all right he's

182
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,310
all set so now for our example we'll

183
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:02,650
just go ahead and come over here pick a

184
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:04,629
leaf and we can see that it says average

185
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:08,009
point and it gives us the reading for

186
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:10,269
one so we'll do that on the second one

187
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:14,709
and we can see what it reads after the

188
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:16,209
second one and then the third one and it

189
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,699
gives us a double beep saying it has

190
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:20,979
taken an average so here it is giving us

191
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,219
our average and then telling us it's in

192
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:27,030
that generic so for our data let's go

193
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,030
ahead and do three more

194
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,839
okay so we have our two averages using

195
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:46,278
the generic alright well I wonder how

196
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,079
our Hartley 5e also reads in span units

197
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,439
so let's change it to sped units and

198
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:55,519
save some averages so we hit exit here

199
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:59,540
we go into setup and then we hit up and

200
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,659
it has used custom measurement yes so we

201
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,919
hit edit and then if we hit over now we

202
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,649
just need to go down until we get this

203
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,110
bad so we just we will scroll through

204
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,480
all the different species we could click

205
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,209
on that we have coefficients saved in

206
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,570
for micro moles of chlorophyll per meter

207
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:20,539
squared so we'll come down till we get

208
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,940
to SPAD there it is right there we'll

209
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:25,309
accept so this is telling us custom

210
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:29,149
measurements yes Spade units so if we

211
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:31,369
hit exit now we hit measure and it's

212
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:33,589
going to say this this file already

213
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,299
exists do you want to overwrite it or do

214
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,350
you want to append it well we just want

215
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:38,689
to append it because we're just taking

216
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,449
the same we're measuring the same plant

217
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,560
same leaves we were just doing in a

218
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,979
different unit so we're going to hit a

219
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:49,099
pend we're going to come up here we're

220
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,019
going to take a reading and there we go

221
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:57,379
telling us the average point one it's

222
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:58,730
bad right here and if for some reason

223
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,320
there was a measurement error we could

224
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,850
just hit delete and then it would ask us

225
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,220
to take that average point two again so

226
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,769
three beeps tells us it did the average

227
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,300
and it's telling us across the top one

228
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:16,839
that it saved that one because we said

229
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:16,838
save every save a sample every three

230
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,620
and here we go so we have two of those

231
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:30,720
now now let's do it in CCI units so

232
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,698
because we've saved that our plant here

233
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,709
with the generic coefficients

234
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:37,979
we've saved them as bad units now let's

235
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:43,708
save them as CCI so go to exit we go to

236
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:46,528
setup we push up use custom units no so

237
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:49,739
we do push there enter when yes it's

238
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:52,379
highlighted we push up no enter it's now

239
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,329
saying use custom units no and when that

240
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,509
says no that means we are now reading in

241
00:10:54,328 --> 00:11:00,508
CCI units so we hit exit we hit measure

242
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,068
it's gonna say you're on that same file

243
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,778
do you want to override our appendant

244
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:05,338
well in our example we just want to

245
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:07,669
append it so we'll just hit there and

246
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:14,819
then we are good to go

247
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:23,039
and that's our first reading our second

248
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:25,169
reading and our third reading in CCI and

249
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:36,870
again just for uniformity we will go

250
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:38,938
ahead and take three more ok so we now

251
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,919
have all these measurements saved on

252
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:43,469
here so now we want to get them onto the

253
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:48,000
computer so we get out of the test menu

254
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:50,009
here and we hit back and we see where it

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,198
says data so in our example we need to

256
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,810
just take the USB that's that's supplied

257
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:57,389
with it and plug it in to the usb on the

258
00:11:54,809 --> 00:12:01,438
model right here on the side so we do

259
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:04,079
that and then we hit data and it says

260
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:06,948
USB link active so now we need to turn

261
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:06,948
on our computer here

262
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,640
and we can see in our example that it

263
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,509
comes up just like a flashdrive would

264
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,240
with the information here and so we see

265
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,799
all these tables come up on the file

266
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,560
these are all the save tables to the

267
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:31,009
unit and then right here is our file so

268
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,839
if I double click here my text documents

269
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,970
automatically open up as notepad however

270
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,610
you have your text documents and so we

271
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,500
can see the time date stamp across the

272
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,750
top and we can see that we're doing

273
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,389
averaging over here we can see these are

274
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,549
our generic coefficients for micro moles

275
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,679
of chlorophyll we see our three readings

276
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:51,500
here our average our three readings here

277
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:54,109
and our average and then we see our

278
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,509
spade units here the average sped units

279
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,200
an average and then we see our CCI units

280
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:02,029
and our CCI units and our average so you

281
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,620
can see that that comes in a CSV file so

282
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,129
that's really easy to drop into a

283
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,090
spreadsheet for more analysis as needed

284
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:10,730
with that that concludes our

285
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,620
demonstration of the MC 100 how to take

286
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,149
measurements if you have any questions

287
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,669
feel free to put them below in the video

288
