1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,259
I'm Bruce Bugbee president of Apogee instruments, and I want to talk in the next few minutes

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:19,289
about photobiology and how ratios of colors of light affect both plant shape and plant

3
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,330
growth.

4
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,279
And by plant growth we mean photosynthesis.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,039
So these are two different things.

6
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,660
Now many many papers have been written on this.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,299
My laboratory at the University has published extensively on this.

8
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:38,709
I've spoken many times on this.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,359
This is a bit like diet and people.

10
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,320
What's the perfect diet for people?

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,210
Well different diets vary for different people, but I want to try and capture the elements

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,539
of this very simply to show you the concepts of it.

13
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,679
So we're going to take plant growth.

14
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:06,620
Let's start with colors, and we're going to start right here with 400 nm.

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,040
This is roughly the start of human vision.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,730
And we're going to go over here to 700 nm.

17
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:21,280
And right in the 500 nm…

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,810
Here's 500 nm.

19
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,750
Here's 600 nm.

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,420
And over here we'll put 800 nm.

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,280
So these are the wavelengths associated with colors of light.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,728
Now if we do blue, this is blue here.

23
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,890
This is elementary, but it's important to the understanding.

24
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:51,569
This out here is red.

25
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,169
And green… right here.

26
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,379
“GRN” Green.

27
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:03,519
These are the three primary wavelengths that drive photosynthesis, and they're roughly

28
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:09,769
equal, which is why we get photosynthetic radiation.

29
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,439
And we say that's equal across here.

30
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:15,539
All these colors contribute equally.

31
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,419
In truth, we know they're not quite equal.

32
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,649
The blue is a little less.

33
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:29,670
The curve is something like this for plant growth, but we still count them equally.

34
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:34,188
But the issue here is not so much plant growth but plant shape.

35
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:38,199
Plant shape is what we can manipulate with colors of light.

36
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:51,818
And now we have to add in the far-red out here, and that's generally up to 750 nm.

37
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:54,528
So here's far-red.

38
00:02:54,528 --> 00:03:04,289
We also need to add in the UV down here, and this is another little edge right here from

39
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:08,169
350 nm up to 400 nm.

40
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:14,039
This goes shorter than this, but this is the beneficial UV.

41
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,248
Shorter than this is usually bad.

42
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:21,388
But there's a lot of good effects of UV from 350 nm to 400 nm.

43
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:28,349
All right 1-2-3-4-5 (five) categories of light.

44
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:34,369
The most efficient LEDs are reds and blues.

45
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,278
So for a long time we had only reds and blues and magenta LEDs.

46
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:43,329
We still have those because these two colors are efficient.

47
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,560
But now we know the green photons are just fine.

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,408
They cause excellent photosynthesis.

49
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:51,858
They penetrate deep into canopies.

50
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:55,450
There's a lot of good reasons to have some green in your lights.

51
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,039
Plus these are the photons that humans can see really well.

52
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,348
So we want some green in.

53
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:08,598
So the most efficient LEDs are these.

54
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:18,269
The whites have… let’s see if I can put this in blue… have a lot of blue light and

55
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,389
then they fluoresce in the green and taper off…

56
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,509
see if I can make that go up.

57
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,719
This is generally a white LED, and it's a cool white.

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,160
Cool white means it looks very white.

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,379
There's a lot of blue light in there.

60
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:44,639
This is the most efficient color of white LEDs as blue LEDs that most of the research

61
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,699
has gone into these.

62
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,090
These have come a long ways.

63
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:53,759
But here's the problem, the blue light causes a little less photosynthesis.

64
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,788
But more importantly, blue light shrinks plants.

65
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:03,310
So you get all that blue light and you get a small compact plant.

66
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,120
That's often considered bad.

67
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,728
But it depends, if you plant at a higher plant density, compact plants can be very good.

68
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,788
In indoor agriculture we want short plants.

69
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:23,538
So high blue light is not necessarily bad, and that's also a very efficient LED.

70
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:31,209
But here's the key: if we take a cool white LED with high blue and compact, now we can

71
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:36,839
add out here some far-red.

72
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,029
And far-red does the exact opposite of blue.

73
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,549
This expands plants.

74
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,990
It makes the leaves expand more, and it makes the plants get taller.

75
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:54,439
So the cutting-edge of research now is the combinations of far-red and high blue light

76
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,610
to shape the plants.

77
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,819
And we turn the dials if we want tall plants, or short plants, wide plants.

78
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:08,069
These are the two primary colors that we use to shape plants in different ratios.

79
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:15,819
These are efficient LEDs and so are far-red efficient LEDs and so are the whites.

80
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,020
So we can rearrange these colors.

81
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:28,258
By this analysis, the greens and the reds become like filler colors.

82
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,129
They cause photosynthesis, but they don't have the power to shape the plants that the

83
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,899
blue and far-red photons have.

84
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:44,079
So this is a concise summary of work in my laboratory that we're doing to shape plants.

85
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,329
Lettuce is in a unique category.

86
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:49,158
Lettuce responds very well to far-red.

87
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,469
It expands the leaves.

88
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,919
It causes rapid growth.

89
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:53,609
This is terrific.

90
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,819
But if you give these far-red photons to Tomatoes, they mostly get taller, and that's bad.

91
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,639
Most crops respond to far-red by getting tall.

92
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:14,579
It's unfortunate, but lettuce and spinach and leafy greens respond to far-red by growing

93
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:15,848
more leaves.

94
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:16,848
That's a good thing.

95
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:21,649
So we can use far-red to counteract blue for crops like lettuce.

96
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,629
How about cannabis?

97
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,399
Everybody wants to know colors of light.

98
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,939
Cannabis, far-red makes it taller, blue makes it shorter.

99
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:35,249
So cannabis is more like tomatoes in this thing.

100
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:39,460
We’ve got to be careful not to give too much far-red for cannabis because they get

101
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,989
too tall.

102
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,400
So this is a very concise summary of some of the cutting-edge research and thresholds

103
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,649
for light.

104
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:58,579
Because far-red is so powerful, Apogee has developed a sensor that measures separately

105
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:09,818
this PPFD in here, it has two detectors, and it has a far-red detector out here.

106
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,220
So it's two detectors in the same sensor.

107
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:19,379
So you can tune your growth chamber to optimize it for both colors of light.

108
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,240
Thanks for listening.
