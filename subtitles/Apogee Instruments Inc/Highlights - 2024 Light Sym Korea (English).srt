Please join me in welcoming Professor Bugbee  with a big hand.

00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:52,856
This is an extremely exciting time. The technology has gone viral,

4
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,216
It's exponential.

5
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:58,646
This is a new threshold and this is  a very fundamental paradigm

6
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,082
underlying all of our photobiology.

7
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:05,168
We're on the threshold  of going from our

8
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:10,527
long held definition of photosynthetic radiation 400 to 700,

9
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:17,140
to Extended PPFD, 400 to 750 nm.
