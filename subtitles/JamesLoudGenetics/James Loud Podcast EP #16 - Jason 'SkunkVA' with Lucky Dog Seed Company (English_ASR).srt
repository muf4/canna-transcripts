welcome to the show

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,179
Thanks James good to be here thanks for

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,920
having me definitely man so my big

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,200
question to start everything off is how

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,260
do you get to Montana

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,020
well that's a crazy story so I uh you

19
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,280
know I've been in the Bay Area since uh

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,920
you know a little bit before the

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,820
Grateful Dead ended in the 90s

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,160
um that's kind of where you get

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,519
deposited when you get deep into that

24
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,859
stuff which it was and uh you know I

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,780
ended up moving up to Sonoma County and

26
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,640
I was there for 30 years almost almost

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,099
30 years uh you know I had my daughter

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,019
there and got married got divorced lived

29
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,640
life there all the stuff it's okay to

30
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,640
grow weed there so that's kind of where

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,379
I was at love the place and then uh as

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,859
things got going with the legalization

33
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,019
in California prop 64 I just kind of I

34
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,959
was on probation for uh some some

35
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,819
cannabis crimes uh kind of kind of had a

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,339
lot of feelings pretty serious case you

37
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,039
know as far as uh how it can be these

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,880
days in California with cannabis I got

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,400
arrested in 2014 and I just uh as as I

40
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,259
saw legalization coming on probation and

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,000
kind of going through my case I just

42
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,259
started to dawn on me I wasn't going to

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,239
really be able to pull it together there

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,560
you know they when they come to you they

45
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,719
come with a wrecking ball you know and

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
they wreck everything for you and any

47
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,840
kind of convenience you think you might

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
want or with it or what they think you

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
may want they'll take that away from you

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,780
a day and they did a good job they

51
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,298
really did a good job of that so

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,799
um you know I I did pretty good there uh

53
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,020
getting through that but then once I got

54
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,260
through it I still wanted to you know I

55
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,599
had plans for legal cannabis and and my

56
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,479
place in it you know as far as clones

57
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:21,299
and seeds and of course flour

58
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,238
um and so I uh just kind of randomly got

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,920
asked by someone I used to know to come

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,378
up here and check it out in Bozeman

61
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,339
Montana never thought I'd even be here

62
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,479
to be honest with I've been everywhere

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,479
in the United States days but I never

64
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,818
came through Montana and I came up here

65
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,859
scoped it out right right before the

66
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,619
pandemic hit

67
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,540
um and you know fell in love with the

68
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,280
place it seemed like a good idea it

69
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,739
seemed like a beautiful place low-key

70
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,959
low-scale not not too much pressure not

71
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,900
you know a commitment as can you know

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,640
these things can be but uh so got the

73
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,680
ball rolling and then the pandemic hit

74
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,139
you know which slowed the inspections

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,879
and the licensing and I was planning on

76
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,619
spending probably half my time here it's

77
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,259
a beautiful place it's one of the most

78
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,900
beautiful places I've ever even been and

79
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:11,098
uh you know it's a lot of work as you

80
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,200
know and I had a partner who uh was you

81
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:14,699
know in it for a minute and then he just

82
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,799
saw how much it was and how difficult

83
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,598
it's going to be and you know it's not

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,060
going to be like a grand slam right when

85
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,399
we hit up the plate and so he bailed

86
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,180
that summer and kind of left me holding

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,099
the bag so uh well that would have been

88
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,680
uh let's see we've got our license in

89
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:34,318
like October of 2020 and like I said

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,680
there was just nothing going on until

91
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:40,199
um you know 21 2021 and then we finally

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,500
opened the doors to The Dispensary

93
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,658
um in 21. so uh I've been up here since

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,519
then I left in April of 21 for the last

95
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,840
time not really knowing what where I was

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,819
going to be and how long I was going to

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,039
be there and I just never left because

98
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,719
you know this stuff uh as you know

99
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,699
consumes all every bit of your time and

100
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,560
energy so

101
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,318
um that's pretty much why I'm here but

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,658
then you know on the on the same coin I

103
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,219
just I love this place it's amazing it

104
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:08,039
kind of reminds me of what the Bay Area

105
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:10,680
was you know and people around here

106
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,598
would hate to hear this but but um kind

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,120
of what it was like and uh then then you

108
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,819
know the late 90s the early 2000s where

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,340
things were you know people wave to you

110
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,079
as they drive by and people say hi and

111
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,698
things like that so that's kind of it

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,019
you know and things are going good I'm

113
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,000
really grateful that it happened I'm

114
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,560
grateful to be here and I like I said

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,120
when I was talking to you before we

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,899
started here that I was back in Sonoma

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,240
County and uh April for Memorial and you

118
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,279
know I I uh I found myself full of

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,400
gratitude that I was no longer there as

120
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,198
hard as that was to to face because it's

121
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,719
just you know

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
you know the people my circles were like

123
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,100
people who were deep in the black market

124
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,779
very much scaled up and it just it's not

125
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,639
it's not it's not going well you know

126
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,159
none of it's going well so so many

127
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,560
people are struggling yeah yes it was

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,660
really sad yeah it was really sad

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,879
yeah yeah yeah and so

130
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,080
it's really interesting because I see

131
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,319
what you're doing over there in Montana

132
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,779
and you have a lot of green flower as

133
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,219
far as what I could gather from you know

134
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,839
in the Bay Area everybody's like

135
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,060
demanding it's got to have purple color

136
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,099
and all these things and you're still

137
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,879
back you know you stuck with your roots

138
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,340
you got chem 91 you've got the the tits

139
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,240
and a lot of your genetics as well yeah

140
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:29,219
we we started off about 56 cultivars

141
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,439
here that I've been holding on to for

142
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,820
you know various amounts of time but all

143
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,339
long time you know like the chem dog

144
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,019
I've had in my possession for well

145
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,879
except for when I got arrested was a

146
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:41,399
short period of time but

147
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,800
um for almost 30 years now

148
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,739
um well I guess about 20 28 years yeah

149
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,060
and but we have uh We've gathered a lot

150
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,220
of other genetics

151
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,720
um and yeah we were running we started

152
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,460
off just running clone only is that

153
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,560
everyone's heard of just thinking hey

154
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,359
what you know that's odd the obvious

155
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,560
strategy and

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,139
um get people to come through the doors

157
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,418
because uh you know people have up here

158
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,400
it's a little different like it's more

159
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,620
homegrown more wholesome the customers

160
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,299
are I would say and they're like they're

161
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,740
not really interested in what they heard

162
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,538
about in fact they probably didn't hear

163
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,879
about it you know right and it could be

164
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:18,240
the demographic of this person can be

165
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,800
anywhere from 25 to 75 but it's the same

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
like some people come through the door

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
and they've heard of strains and they

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,840
want to check them out and so we've

169
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
tried to get stuff that falls into that

170
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,899
line you know

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,580
um and we've done pretty good we've

172
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,138
we've done some nice selecting but the

173
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,899
idea was to kind of get things you've

174
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,759
heard of you know the classics and then

175
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,138
now this now this year we're doing our

176
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,460
own selections we're gonna put those

177
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,560
selections out we're getting you know

178
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,239
really good response and

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,399
um it's starting to go out wholesale

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
around the state the lucky dog stuff and

181
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,000
you know it's making me really happy

182
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,038
because I always hope that would be you

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,579
know part of the journey you know that's

184
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:55,680
awesome yeah I do strains here now I

185
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,899
think that we offer

186
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
um and we have any day we have 54

187
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,879
streams out available for the customer

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,160
to choose from you know so what size

189
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,319
cultivation space do you guys have oh

190
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,199
it's pretty small we're under 2 000 feet

191
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,060
right now 2 000 square feet so

192
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,978
um and some of that's for breeding some

193
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,319
of that's for the nursery

194
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,360
um but you know it's the thing about

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,919
Montana that's interesting that I think

196
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,960
might people might be interested in is

197
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,818
that uh when when I came here was

198
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,459
medical and there was a thing called

199
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,860
tethering so you had to be Tethered to a

200
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,719
medical a medical dispensary as a

201
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,598
patient you couldn't shop around you had

202
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,099
to pick one and be Tethered to it

203
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,620
um now I don't know if they were allowed

204
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:39,000
to be if you could go to others but you

205
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,379
definitely had to be Tethered to at

206
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,240
least one

207
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,279
um so and then the other part was is

208
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,620
that it was vertically integrated forced

209
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,659
vertical integration so whatever you

210
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,459
grow whatever you produce the hash you

211
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,620
make the Horizon you make whatever it is

212
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,939
you have to sell yourself you can't sell

213
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,879
to other companies this is in the

214
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,439
beginning right and then uh you so when

215
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,120
I got here I honestly hadn't really

216
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,939
thought too much about oh my God we're

217
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,978
gonna have to build [ __ ] dispensary

218
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,839
um so we did and it's gorgeous and I

219
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:09,538
love it it's actually been like uh on

220
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,038
the rough days some of my you know it's

221
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:12,598
almost like meditation to be able to go

222
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,579
in there and kind of put you know my

223
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:17,219
artwork on the wall and you know build

224
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,740
the place out make it look nice and then

225
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,460
they got rid of vertical integration

226
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,639
um in uh January of 21-22 uh when the

227
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,978
full wreck went into effect here and uh

228
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,840
now we can sell wholesale we can receive

229
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,759
wholesale you know of course the

230
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,978
customers can go anywhere they want

231
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,899
so it's really interesting

232
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,520
yeah that's really cool I mean I like

233
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,559
the boutique aspect of it that is

234
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,939
vertical integration but on a boutique

235
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,419
level which you don't really see in

236
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,680
California very often if at all yeah I

237
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,000
would say it's kind of harder to do that

238
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,219
there I'm sure there's I know there's

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,620
some people who do it some companies but

240
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,019
we grow the Cannabis in the same place

241
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,360
we sell it to the customer

242
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,039
um our our solventless lab is in the

243
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,539
same facility

244
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,539
um our all of our breeding and Nursery

245
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,860
space is in the same facility so I mean

246
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:06,059
really it's kind of amazing because you

247
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,440
know you come to work and it's just

248
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,000
everything is here you feel like going

249
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,860
to make cash today then you go make cash

250
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,419
if you feel like you know whatever it is

251
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,000
you want to do like you know it's right

252
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,458
here so it allows us to have like a very

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,600
small team that's super dedicated to

254
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,579
what we're doing

255
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,379
yeah I love it it's perfect for me I

256
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,820
don't really I'm not a big scale guy

257
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,519
like I don't feel like there's always

258
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,080
just endless amounts I have to do I I

259
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,879
feel like you find that little sweet

260
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,040
spot where you can find some comfort and

261
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,480
happiness in your life but also you know

262
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,699
be creative and do the things that you

263
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,480
want you set out to do you know

264
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,700
um our tissue culture lab is upstairs

265
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,899
um you know so it's pretty awesome I

266
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,879
love it here it's not like what people

267
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,278
think it's very different you know

268
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,100
yeah that's really cool it sounds

269
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:53,220
awesome so let's take a let's take a

270
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,560
stab at the past and talk about uh how

271
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,879
you got your start in the industry not

272
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,619
even that let's talk about how you

273
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,659
started smoking in the Grateful Dead and

274
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,299
uh kind of dive into that

275
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:05,719
okay well I mean I started smoking when

276
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:09,240
I was you know a young boy in Virginia

277
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,879
14. I'm sure I smoked some swag buds

278
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,320
first and you know I was into it it was

279
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,620
it was pretty awesome I love the way it

280
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,019
felt my friends were into it uh but then

281
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,519
uh we were living my mom and my dad got

282
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,139
divorced my mom and my sister and I

283
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,179
moved into this little apartment complex

284
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,179
and there was some definitely some shady

285
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:29,338
people there uh in Richmond Virginia and

286
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,379
it was this cat across the street he was

287
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,480
uh I don't know if he was Puerto Rican

288
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,580
or I think it was Cuban actually yeah he

289
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,980
had like the hair and the gold rim

290
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,080
glasses and he was missing a leg I won't

291
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,940
forget that it was missing a leg it was

292
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,440
always by the pool and everybody else's

293
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,940
and all the other adults were at work

294
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,380
you know

295
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,420
um you know in the summertime when we

296
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,919
were raging out there with kids and then

297
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,179
I don't know what it was but one day he

298
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,338
invited me and my friend into his

299
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:56,219
apartment and he had an Alaskan Thunder

300
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,720
[ __ ] plant he said and he just wanted to

301
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,860
show it to us for some reason you know

302
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,720
we were I don't know 14 or 15 and uh now

303
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,879
when you open the closet door you had

304
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,620
one beautiful plant in there under a

305
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,958
metal halide light that looked like it

306
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,139
got shaken from a Street Lamp and it

307
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:15,599
just was like it was like holy [ __ ] look

308
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,639
at that the smell came at me and just

309
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,560
that humidity that life the humidity

310
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,838
came out of there and just wafted me and

311
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,239
that was it I fell in love and that was

312
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,800
it was Off to the Races you know and

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,180
then you know of course dead tour I

314
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,919
think everybody knows and if they don't

315
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,778
they should that uh you know the

316
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,099
Grateful Dead tour was like a bizarre I

317
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,259
mean you know you could get whatever you

318
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,720
wanted out there it was like what true

319
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,338
capitalism is you know you buy low and

320
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
you sell High

321
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,060
um and can't kind bud was always a part

322
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,059
of it you know so when I saw that first

323
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,259
plan of that Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] I mean

324
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,699
that was the first time I'd ever seen

325
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,399
kind bud

326
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,140
um smoked it shortly thereafter and in

327
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839
Richmond you know you know we were

328
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,939
really we had an interesting little uh

329
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,120
kind of a culture there we like we had

330
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,820
like phenomenal herb When We Were Young

331
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,799
um it was just these older older this

332
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,320
old this circle of older dudes who were

333
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,599
growing you know the Nigerian and the

334
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,300
Afghan and the Beatrix choice and the

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,040
super skunk of course and Northern

336
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:15,359
Lights Number two but we just caught it

337
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,240
Northern Lights but I think it would

338
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,459
have been the number two as they say now

339
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,500
um you know the knights the Hayes I mean

340
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,958
we just had like an array of like

341
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,480
top-notch genetics that were you know

342
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,099
clearly selected by you know someone who

343
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,440
knew what the hell they were doing it

344
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,300
really was working and uh you know these

345
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,579
circles are small but in at the time of

346
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,078
Virginia you know like one plant would

347
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:39,239
get you five to forty years of

348
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,458
penitentiary and where does that number

349
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,440
come from well during the drug war 5 to

350
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,659
40 sounds good on a commercial on a

351
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,579
campaign ad and you know so it was

352
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,240
serious business and you know

353
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,879
um

354
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,039
you know growing up there was different

355
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,078
because like the drug war was we were on

356
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,360
the front line there even without even

357
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,219
knowing it I mean it was just you know

358
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,079
that it was just a lot of people being

359
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,200
incarcerated for cannabis and

360
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:06,359
psychedelics and you know uh those types

361
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,680
of things so it's like you kind of you

362
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,800
know you learned at a young age how

363
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,599
serious this stuff can be and how uh you

364
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,219
know when you make choices it can it can

365
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,540
affect the rest of your life potentially

366
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,180
because you could you know you would see

367
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,120
it happen to a guy that you know that a

368
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:23,099
friend of yours knows or whatever and so

369
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,139
grew to have a respect for these people

370
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,180
you know for these older folks who are

371
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,100
doing this because you know I could put

372
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,899
to connect the dots and like wow what a

373
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,339
dedication that is to like take that

374
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,078
risk

375
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,720
um you know yeah the weed's great is

376
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,759
amazing but it's also a lifestyle and to

377
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,920
take that risk for that lifestyle I just

378
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,958
always it just took me back you know and

379
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,699
kind of I don't know it was kind of like

380
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,059
mythical to me and you know I just

381
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,180
wanted to know more and so as as it as

382
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:54,239
as it goes in the you know early 90s and

383
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,919
late 80s late 80s really um The Grateful

384
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,299
Dead come through town quite often they

385
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,979
were actually banned from Virginia but

386
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,539
they still would pop through under a

387
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,220
different name surprised they were

388
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,958
actually banned by the state legislature

389
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,579
in 1985.

390
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,958
which is interesting I don't think that

391
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,059
happens to rock and roll bands or

392
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,919
anything else of that size but that uh I

393
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,838
think they probably wore that as a badge

394
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,719
of honor um but anyway

395
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,399
so you know eventually as I tell people

396
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,320
you know they came through and

397
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,240
brainwashed you know kidnapped me and

398
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,980
brainwashed me and dragged me all around

399
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,320
North America

400
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,940
asked me to do some shady stuff which

401
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,519
was really nice Shady it was all light

402
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,279
but definitely against the law and

403
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,399
always in the background always every

404
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:37,679
single day cannabis was the the you know

405
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,120
the focus because you know when you go

406
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,099
to a dead show and you're a kid and you

407
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,440
got you know you can make a little money

408
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,120
I mean in a Grateful Dead parking lot as

409
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,800
they say you just reach your hand up and

410
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,299
grab yours you know it's it's floating

411
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,759
there you just gotta go get it you don't

412
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,919
have to take some risks but

413
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,078
um so at the end of the day like you

414
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,059
know you wanted a ticket a place to you

415
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,338
know gas to get to the next show you

416
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,799
wanted uh you know maybe a place to

417
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,839
sleep some floor space in a hotel and

418
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,519
most importantly maybe the well the

419
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,320
ticket was always but most importantly

420
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,759
after the ticket was of sack of kind

421
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,260
buds

422
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,879
um that was the medicine you know that

423
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,039
kept you kept you okay on the road

424
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,838
because it wasn't like it wasn't like a

425
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,599
big fantasy it was a lot of you know

426
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,699
you're in big cities in America you know

427
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,139
it's it wasn't like exactly Spirals and

428
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:24,899
rainbows every today and there was a lot

429
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:27,240
of stress believe that and you know kind

430
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,220
buds what can you say so you know if you

431
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,959
get into it and then and then after a

432
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,639
while you start to say hey geez you know

433
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,138
like every time I go to a show I'm in a

434
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,480
different region I can be in Ohio like

435
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm in New York or in the Boston area

436
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,459
and you know sure Virginia even Miami we

437
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,139
found a a grower down there that would

438
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,578
you know come and look for us one that

439
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,100
we would get to town and they would

440
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:49,138
bring boatloads of cannas and you know

441
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,420
you could sell 30 40 pounds of weed in

442
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,180
the parking lot in a day and and you

443
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:56,039
know drink fancy beers tonight you know

444
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,239
so it was a lifestyle and it was a big

445
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,159
part there's a lot of other things

446
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,620
around it that you know you can't really

447
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,958
talk about in public yet but but the

448
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,959
Cannabis was always like the focus and

449
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:09,179
so you know after a while as a 17 year

450
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,039
old kind of I wasn't really a runaway

451
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,859
but like a young person out on the road

452
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,259
in America like my big goal was like one

453
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,000
day I'm gonna you know save up enough

454
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:21,179
duckets I'm gonna get myself some grow

455
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,039
lights and and some clones from Virginia

456
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,679
hopefully I'll bump into one of these

457
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,240
older dudes they'll hook me up and uh

458
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,278
and grow some wheat that was the big

459
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,339
plan and lo and behold that's exactly

460
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,958
what happened luckily for me so

461
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,600
um you know and then when Jerry died I

462
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,518
was uh like I said they when you when

463
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,680
you uh when you follow the Grateful Dead

464
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,360
you're you certainly are going to get to

465
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,138
the Bay Area at some point San Francisco

466
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,759
Bay area and that's what happened to me

467
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:49,500
and you know there was no place for many

468
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,300
of us to go after the tour was over and

469
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,339
we weren't all the way on the road you

470
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:55,198
know there would be winter tour spring

471
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,019
tours summer tour fall tour but there

472
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,539
was days between and what to do where to

473
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,919
go and you know where can we be safe and

474
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,199
where can we just kind of be ourselves

475
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,938
without causing a scene and the Bay Area

476
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,279
certainly is a place like that Sanford

477
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,839
psycho is always well it's different

478
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,558
these days but it was always welcoming

479
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:16,078
to Freaks Like Us and uh but then how to

480
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:17,759
get to how do you like eat where do you

481
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,879
sleep how do you get gas how do you feed

482
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,439
your dog how your girlfriend like well

483
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,299
we sold weed in the park you know we

484
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,759
sold weed in panhandle Park you know

485
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,859
strangers and every Tuesday or Wednesday

486
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,140
you know they try to switch it up it was

487
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,058
only says today's sfpd would roll

488
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,100
through the park on dirt bikes and you

489
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:36,240
know they were always watching and you

490
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,678
know it's a lot you know it's like this

491
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,319
one little spot in the Panhandle we'd

492
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,480
skateboard do rail slides and hang out

493
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,859
and then you know with all kinds of

494
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,720
people in the city would come down there

495
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:48,418
you know and risk their own freedom to

496
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,000
get their their cannabis

497
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,940
um you know I sold weed the age patients

498
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,519
and cancer patients and just all kinds

499
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,740
of people who you know

500
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,298
you know like you could see that it was

501
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,980
the stress it was for them to have to

502
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:05,279
come down to the park and just cop wheat

503
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,779
from us [ __ ] kids was you know

504
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,399
um probably really stressful for them

505
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,899
but I would say that some of them they

506
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,519
had no choice there was no other place

507
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,860
for them to go and it helped them I

508
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,819
would imagine and of course there was a

509
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,379
lot of other people who were just

510
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:19,019
getting off work and just you know the

511
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,380
normal guy or you know who wanted to buy

512
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:24,179
some weed so you know weed was really

513
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,980
expensive in the city back then it was

514
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,259
four and a quarter for weight you know

515
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,700
and it was always outdoor never in the

516
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,140
indoor

517
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,460
um so it was hard it was a struggle and

518
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,280
that's where the word hate comes from

519
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,960
because you know we would take uh an

520
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,720
ounce of weed and make 10 8 out of it

521
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,460
and those extra two would be a little

522
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,960
extra cash for us and the rest of it

523
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,840
would go right back to the guy who had

524
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,538
the weight up on Waller Street and

525
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,699
um so anyway that's uh that's kind of

526
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:52,980
how it went and then I met a gentleman

527
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,419
from uh Staten Island kind of

528
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,339
coincidentally and he's the one who

529
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,679
ended up giving me the Kim dog we met in

530
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,480
the Park actually

531
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,880
um and he brought some indoor weed down

532
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,919
uh from Sonoma County he had moved out

533
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,260
from Staten Island from New York and was

534
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,179
trying to live out his uh you know

535
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,240
Grateful Dead Fantasy seeing Jerry

536
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:15,059
Garcia at The Warfield on Market Street

537
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,859
kind of like you know the Apex of

538
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:19,798
Grateful Dead Land is to be able to see

539
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,359
him see Jerry Garcia at The Warfield and

540
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,660
um he actually had a bunch of indoor

541
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,279
weed and it was 300 an ounce and so it's

542
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,840
just trippy because like you know a lot

543
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,519
of those people who we I went through

544
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,159
they're still like my brothers and

545
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,440
sisters a lot of them are gone now and

546
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
uh for various reasons but there are

547
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,279
still a few around and we have like this

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,220
special connection because it was not

549
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,379
easy you know it was you know you know

550
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,940
people getting robbed with guns I mean

551
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,740
my friends got shot on the street you

552
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,538
know and brought daylight I mean those

553
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,940
cops were always there you know like

554
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,980
some people who maybe got further into

555
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,360
drugs would you know kind of not leave

556
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,220
to go back on tour and they would stay

557
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,918
in the city and you're like you know

558
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,240
very of disappointing and sad to see but

559
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,940
then you'd come back and they're gone

560
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,500
after tour what happened so and so you

561
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,080
know what happened to Kathy you know oh

562
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,240
she's she's in she got locked up man she

563
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,918
got her second felony for holding weed

564
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,620
and you know she's going to be away for

565
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,080
a minute you know or or you know another

566
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:18,298
gentleman Moon you know he he became a

567
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,678
fixture in San Quentin because he's he

568
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:22,379
got caught too many times up on the

569
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,140
street there and you know changed who he

570
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,460
was of course like prison will do so it

571
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,900
wasn't always easy it was a lot of

572
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,179
stress it was just the days between

573
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,798
trying to get to the next thing and

574
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:33,960
anyway

575
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,579
um I think uh I think I'm going on a

576
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,079
little too much about that but but no

577
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:38,639
that's great this that's that's what

578
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,418
this show is all about you know I mean I

579
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,940
think

580
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,440
telling your story and and the story of

581
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,120
the other side of the Grateful Dead

582
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,740
because people hear one side about the

583
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,899
music and there's a whole nother side

584
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,058
you know on the other side of Shakedown

585
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,519
Street that uh you know I think people

586
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:55,139
need to hear and as we get older there's

587
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,980
less and less people to tell the story

588
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,720
to

589
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,700
you know that's something I've realized

590
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,980
and I've kind of I've always kind of

591
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,980
realized it but I somehow separated

592
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,779
myself from that thing and you know I

593
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,819
think lately I've just kind of accepted

594
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,740
that like you know I I have a good

595
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:13,500
memory of what those days were like and

596
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,839
I I have a vivid memory of it and

597
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,298
um you know if you look around like you

598
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,099
know Jerry used to say about what we

599
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:21,839
were doing that this is the last great

600
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,759
American Adventure he called the whole

601
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,220
thing you know and the whole thing is

602
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,779
it's it's okay we were on tour we were

603
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,759
following a band but it really was so

604
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,678
much more than that it was it was a

605
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,220
whole culture that went Generations deep

606
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,038
you know and uh I mean just like whole

607
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,558
like aspects of culture were developed

608
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:42,298
and became tradition and you know around

609
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,940
smoking even you know

610
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,259
um so it's just like I do think it's

611
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,759
it's kind of neat to be able to tell

612
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,220
people because you know we a lot of us

613
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,019
we were very reserved and you know you

614
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,058
you could you could uh definitely find

615
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,740
yourself not having anyone to hang out

616
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:58,079
with if you talk too much about what was

617
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,240
going on out there I mean weed was just

618
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,240
one thing you know that was just a a

619
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,058
small aspect a large aspect but like a

620
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,099
more minor aspect of some of the work we

621
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:10,500
were trying to do to kind of you know

622
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,079
bring some light into the world and you

623
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,298
know into a rather Dark World and um so

624
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,918
you know I'm kind of I'm so grateful

625
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,440
that that happened to me you know like I

626
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,320
do feel like I got you know kidnapped in

627
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,720
a sense and brainwashed in a sense and

628
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,579
uh and I'm I thank God every day for it

629
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,640
you know it took me to the Bay Area I

630
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:31,798
met my daughter's mother you know and I

631
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,299
have my beautiful daughter and you know

632
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:34,798
these things were all

633
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,779
you know

634
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,639
you know seemingly coincidence but when

635
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,759
you look back on it it wasn't it was

636
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,980
just it's been you know it's added up to

637
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,839
in my opinion for my life an amazing

638
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,220
life and I it hasn't been boring hasn't

639
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,079
been easy but it hasn't been boring and

640
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,900
I have that whole thing to think to that

641
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,158
for me it was that that you know broke

642
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,259
me out of that what would have happened

643
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,000
if it if I didn't decide to not go back

644
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,220
to Richmond which was a tough decision

645
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,400
you know hitchhiking from Kansas to the

646
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,259
barrier with nothing you know not even a

647
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,780
dollar was because the van broke down

648
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,720
this is a whole long story but you know

649
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,700
it was not an easy decision you know but

650
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,159
I'm glad I took the next step for it I

651
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,019
kept walking to Florida kept what's the

652
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,840
next adventure like what's this all lead

653
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,400
to and you know I'm grateful for it so

654
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,379
and it is a big part of it and that

655
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,659
gentleman who I met in the park who gave

656
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,520
me the Kim dog he was very grateful for

657
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:28,620
me sewing all this weed that day so he

658
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,960
could keep his California Dream alive

659
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:33,479
you know he's still a friend of mine he

660
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,140
just texted me a minute ago and um

661
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,419
uh you know like he told me hey you know

662
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,860
he was so grateful for for what I did

663
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,538
for him that day and I was more grateful

664
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:45,240
to him he just I don't think I expressed

665
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:46,859
it well enough but he um he's like when

666
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,240
this is all over he was a deadhead but

667
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,979
he wasn't on a tour anymore he was a

668
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,140
little bit older and a lot of the older

669
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,380
people were not into the new keyboard

670
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,480
player and so he uh he told me well this

671
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,280
is all over you know if you want to get

672
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,960
a house and some you know if you want to

673
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,779

674
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,900
you up with clones and I'll uh you know

675
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,639
show you what I know and he he pulled he

676
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,759
came through on that after Jerry died in

677
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,200
1995 and I never looked back that's

678
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,220
that's always well not what I've been

679
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,259
doing so

680
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,120
it's just you know one thing leads to

681
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,919
another and here we are you know we

682
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:21,658
gotta lead on on the shelf that

683
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,059
strangers can come in and buy it looks

684
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,280
like my living room but it's not it's a

685
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:29,700
long strange trip like very long

686
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,619
seriously yeah and I I feel like we are

687
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,880
the you know there's the evolution of

688
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,099
the Grateful Dead that turned into dead

689
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,780
and Company but we are the evolution of

690
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,839
the Grateful Dead especially working in

691
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:43,019
cannabis you know even Lagunitas Brewery

692
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,119
I think Tony McGee from Lagunitas he to

693
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,619
a degree in their company is the

694
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,519
evolution of the Grateful Dead and where

695
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:53,519
they went uh you know Craft products

696
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,079
uh yeah and it's it's just an amazing

697
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,538
beautiful thing and we're just so

698
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,158
blessed to have been able to get on this

699
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:01,558
path stay on this path and be where

700
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,900
we're at now I agree with you yeah I

701
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,579
like those Lagunitas guys they're uh I

702
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,100
like their style when I first came here

703
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:09,599
the regulations as you know are just you

704
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:11,219
know you can't keep up with it to change

705
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,959
none of it makes any sense I don't know

706
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,880
who makes this stuff up but anyone who

707
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,220
knows anything about this stuff but when

708
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,960
I first came here my uh the logo I have

709
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,640
has a pot leaf on it out of hanging out

710
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,679
of dogs nothing the inspector came he's

711
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,840
like oh you can't have that I'm like I

712
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,159
can't have that and at first right when

713
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,259
he told me I was like oh I got an idea

714
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,059
because I remember those guys in uh

715
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,200
Petaluma there they uh they had that

716
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:32,839
beer chronic I don't know if you

717
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,298
remember those

718
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:38,459
r-o-m-i-k and ATF came and raided them

719
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:41,038
and caught some smoking weed in the in

720
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,480
the uh in the brewery down there and

721
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,339
shut them down so they were like they

722
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,798
had to shut down ale right and I was

723
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,759
like that's funny and then the whoever I

724
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,379
don't know who it was at the company

725
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,538
sounds like you know those folks but

726
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,340
they uh decided to put censored over

727
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:55,980
chronic yeah and then every year the

728
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:57,959
sensor gets just a little bit smaller so

729
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,700
you can see chronic behind it with a K

730
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,500
that's I don't know how that could be

731
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,240
problem for people but

732
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
um so that was like okay we'll just do

733
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,880
that we'll just do what laganies do

734
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,619
we'll just put the sensor thing out in

735
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,480
front of the leaf and and then see what

736
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:11,278
they think about that you know totally

737
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,140
yeah boundary pushers I mean they're

738
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,058
boundary pushers you're a boundary

739
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,980
Pusher I've been pushing boundaries my

740
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:18,658
whole life and I mean I think that's how

741
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,659
we make progress is doing stuff we

742
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:23,820
believe in yeah yeah I totally agree so

743
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,500
let's let's dive into this this scale

744
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:28,139
let's let's talk about

745
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,058
the name skunk VA and how it got

746
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,380
associated with chemdog because I think

747
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:33,599
that's a great story you were on the

748
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,778
forums that was your name on the forums

749
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,778
I take it uh but where did it come from

750
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:41,640
well it was it did come from overgrowth

751
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:44,159
so I uh

752
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,159
um we have a mutual friend uh boundary

753
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,659
Pusher as well he says and uh he grew up

754
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,700
with uh

755
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,580
um he grew up in the Northeast you know

756
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,159
in New Hampshire and he somehow met a

757
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:58,379
you know G Kim dog at a official I

758
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,179
believe and you know he got turned onto

759
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,940
the chem dog before I met him we did

760
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,980
some dead tour together and uh you know

761
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,419
as things kind of progressed I had I got

762
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,919
the kill dog but I I didn't even know

763
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,020
this guy you know I was only hearing it

764
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,538
from my friend who you know who met him

765
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,819
back there and I thought it was really

766
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:17,339
interesting and you know that I got this

767
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:18,720
cut from this guy who I didn't know at

768
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:20,639
the time but he got it from him when

769
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,400
they did a trade for a super skunk cut

770
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,960
and uh in in the tri-state area kind of

771
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,298
in New York um some friends of mine in

772
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,519
Virginia came up and traded the number

773
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:33,418
six Super Skunk it's an F2 Super Skunk

774
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,940
for uh Kim dog and so at that point

775
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,799
um my friend from Staten Island who you

776
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,679
know I'm speaking about he he was the

777
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,839
one who went out and uh he got that cut

778
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,278
and brought it back so that's how I got

779
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,199
it I didn't know anything about the

780
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,599
origins it wasn't really a story to go

781
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,940
with it you know as you know because

782
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,079
you're you're my demographic that you

783
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,519
know those things did they didn't really

784
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,839
matter that much then like they were

785
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,038
just getting talked about because you

786
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,720
know you're really just basically

787
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,879
telling someone else's business you know

788
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,679
so then that's a No-No

789
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,080
um so we were rocking it out and and

790
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,059
going for it but then I saw High Times

791
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,178
article

792
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:11,399
um in I think it was 2005. I can't it

793
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,840
must have been 2005 and it was an

794
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,340
interview they were doing with with G

795
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:15,959
and I was like hey man that's your buddy

796
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:18,058

797
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,519
other chem dog sisters from the original

798
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:22,200
seat Pop I was like you know you said is

799
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,879

800
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200

801
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,240
you give them a call let's go get some

802
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,500
of this I wanted to get the sister I

803
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,298
wanted to I saw the sister in the

804
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,980
magazine I was like God damn that looks

805
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:35,879
like the chem dog would just better you

806
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:39,360
know like not better but stronger yeah

807
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,400
exactly and so yeah he was you know uh

808
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,019
he just wasn't he it seemed like too

809
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,880
much and so

810
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,319
um I don't remember exactly how I got on

811
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,940
to like the overgrow because I it wasn't

812
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,278
something that I was doing or even

813
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,538
really knew about but somehow maybe I

814
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,759
Googled something I really don't know

815
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:55,500
what it was but I saw that he was on

816
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,419
there I saw a picture of it these people

817
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,359
were talking about the Kim dog so I

818
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,559
joined it the overgrow thing and you

819
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,819
know I was like I just want to send this

820
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,798
guy a message I was like this might be

821
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,918
my one chance so

822
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,839
um I uh I did all the things and like I

823
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,179
said he set these t-shirts out with this

824
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:15,480
uh I might even have right here the chem

825
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,400
Dog logo like uh this one right here it

826
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,940
was on the front of the T-shirt right oh

827
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,278
yeah and yeah like that one right there

828
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,600
um and he had uh uh he sent a super

829
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,038
skunk went out because like I said he

830
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,819
got the super skunk from my friends in

831
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:29,519
Virginia

832
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:31,558
so he had the Kim dog since 1991 on the

833
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,298
front and then he had the dog smoking it

834
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:34,980
was a cool shirt and then and nobody

835
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:37,500
else had it was just like you know it

836
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,058
was a gift from him to my friend to me

837
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,099
and it was like it meant a lot to me of

838
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:42,480
course you know and so I was like oh I

839
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:43,918
got an idea when they let me make the

840
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,599
Avatar I was like I'll take a picture of

841
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,919
my shirt and he'll definitely recognize

842
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,939
it and then we can start chit-chatting

843
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,940
you know because I want to go get this

844
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,100
cut and and truth be told I saw on the

845
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,080
High Times article I was I was I read it

846
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,000
I noticed there was no chem dog anywhere

847
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:59,158
we had all these other chem strains but

848
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,679
not the chem dog and I said hmm maybe he

849
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,899
doesn't have it you know or something so

850
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,000
um so anyways I I did just that I put up

851
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:08,579
some pictures of my plants up my chem

852
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,079
dog pictures and my super skunks

853
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,538
um my sour diesels actually at the time

854
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,339
I didn't have a super skunk at that time

855
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:17,460
um my super skunk pictures were

856
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:19,139
polarized anyways different story but so

857
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,700
um and it worked he was like where'd you

858
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,820
get that shirt you know and we started

859
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,679
talking and oh oh so the skunk VA so I

860
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,019
had to like you have to give yourself a

861
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,580
name you know absolutely like hey we all

862
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,038
do this we have like everyone's got a

863
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,359
thousand different you know social media

864
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,679
things and you got to have the special

865
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,719
little name and everything like that but

866
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,580
this was like first time I'd ever seen

867
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,319
anything like this or maybe maybe there

868
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:43,500
wasn't much of this anywhere to be seen

869
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:47,038
anyway uh 2005 you know so I was like

870
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,980
skunk Super Skunk Virginia VA skunk VA

871
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,839
you know so that's what I did and um and

872
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,339
yeah then we got to talking and then a

873
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,918
month later I'm in New York with a

874
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:57,418
couple of chem dog cuts in a hotel in

875
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,580
SoHo

876
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:01,200
um and we met up and ended up not giving

877
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:03,119
me the sister you know give me the Kim D

878
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,259
and and what turns out to be the mass

879
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,719
Super Skunk

880
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:08,819
um don't know what what happened but the

881
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,798
the number six somehow got turned into

882
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:13,379
the mass Super Skunk

883
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,720
um grew took it back to California flew

884
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,480
back to California and grew them out

885
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,240
um the Kim D you know spit out a bunch

886
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,399
of bananas on it the first run uh we

887
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,319
were over feeding it and then

888
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:26,939
um and then the super skunk turned out

889
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,038
to be a I guess we didn't know at the

890
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,380
time it had similarities but it wasn't

891
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,960
the same one so we kind of passed on I

892
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,820
grew twice two crops of it let it go

893
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,259
wasn't didn't smell like super skunks it

894
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:39,359
was like it may have been good herb to

895
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:41,759
some but to me with the bias that I had

896
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,558
in my mind of the super skunk it just it

897
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,640
just it just was a disappointment to the

898
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:45,839
point where I didn't want to do that

899
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,759
anymore

900
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,619
um so yeah so that you know but the good

901
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,119
news is we brought the chem the chem D

902
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:55,079
out to the West Coast for the first time

903
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:57,359
it was out 2006 February and and then he

904
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,720
I gave him a couple of very healthy cuts

905
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,519
of the chem dog you know so it's uh

906
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,839
that's that's how I went that's how it

907
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,179
happened I never went back on there

908
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,500
again and and then I actually kind of

909
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,759
forgot about it you know because I just

910
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,038
did I just went through this whole

911
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,319
overgrowth just to kind of like get this

912
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,778
get this cuts from this guy or meet up

913
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,178
with him in this so

914
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:20,640
um you know fast forward six years

915
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,200
someone gave me some cuts that were sick

916
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,580
and or they weren't sick when they gave

917
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,679
them to it a few weeks later they were

918
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:27,298
definitely sick and then my plants were

919
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,759
definitely sick and you know I'm

920
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:31,740
searching the soil with a microscope and

921
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,960
you know trying to figure out everything

922
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,159
I can think of and so I'm like I came to

923
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,360
a loss I was like I don't know what the

924
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,460
hell's wrong with these plants they look

925
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:42,119
like they're being poisoned though and

926
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,819
uh so I I went on to uh one of the

927
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:47,099
um one of the newer Foreman forums and

928
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:48,359
uh you know I called myself the good old

929
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,579
dog you know because you still had to do

930
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,959
a name I forgot all about this [ __ ] and

931
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:53,639
then I posted the exact same pictures

932
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,019
because I didn't I really wasn't taking

933
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,860
a lot of pictures of my weed during

934
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:58,619
those

935
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:59,819
you know years of producing packs as we

936
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,579
say

937
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:04,918
um and somebody was like I got like well

938

939
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,380
once

940
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,500
where did you get those photos did you

941
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,760

they called it New York City Diesel we

971
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,579
had the sour diesel the New York City

972
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:16,260
Diesel and we had the dog d-a-w-g and

973
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,659
that was like the dog butt or whatever

974
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,240
and so when I thought chem dog I I

975
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,960
thought it was Kim d-a-w-g I didn't you

976
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,178
know

977
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,059
we didn't have the information as

978
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:30,179
accessible at the time and uh you know

979
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:33,000
but but the structure definitely the 91

980
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,679
uh has a very unique structure that you

981
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,358
can't miss with the with this like very

982
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,338
very similar to Sour Diesel with the

983
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:40,378
with the green leaves in that burnt Tire

984
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:43,139
on the nose you know I feel like it's

985
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:45,299
unmistakable it's not like for me it's

986
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,399
nostalgic every time I smell it I'm like

987
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,859
[ __ ] chem 91 from back in the day you

988
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:52,199
know yeah it does it lights up the

989
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:53,940
memory bank for sure for me too I agree

990
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,279
I love that part about it actually you

991
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,838
know it's like it's just it's not a

992
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,839
particular memory it's just like a

993
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,820
collage of just like the past and you

994
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,099
know you know in some ways better days

995
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,080
you know not to say these days are no

996
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,940
good but just you know more Adventure

997
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,319
more fun and just like really just hit

998
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,820
you right in the heart and I love that

999
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,320
about it I totally agree and I know

1000
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,359
exactly what you mean

1001
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,460
yes sour Diesel's another one it's like

1002
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,900
all the all the genetics if you if you

1003
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,220
were to smell the same stuff now it'd

1004
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,300
bring you right back and that's the

1005
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:26,159
beauty of of uh these Aromas you know

1006
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,720
and I mean it's tied to so much more

1007
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,399
than just oh it's good smoke man these

1008
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,179
are tied to experiences we've had in the

1009
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,160
past oh yeah yeah yeah I I I feel that

1010
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:37,500
too and I mean I I would say my memory

1011
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,719
my mom always used to point out to me

1012
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,219
that you know she said ever since you're

1013
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,019
born the first thing you do when you

1014
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:44,578
find a new object you know a piece of

1015
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,259
fruit or something she knew that I

1016
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,460
didn't have experience the first thing

1017
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,040
you do is stick it up your nose and

1018
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,179
smell it and I could really she goes I

1019
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,639
know that I noticed it because I'm the

1020
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:55,858
same way you know and uh so I think my

1021
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,960
memory is very much associated with with

1022
00:35:55,858 --> 00:36:01,319
my nose you know yeah me too and I mean

1023
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,358
I think so so breeding and cooking and

1024
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,539
all these experiences that revolve

1025
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,578
around things like food and wine and

1026
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,320
even even tobacco it's all Based on data

1027
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,940
points right so like the more data

1028
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,700
points you have the more of a library

1029
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,320
you have in your head the the easier it

1030
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:18,719
is to come up with combinations but also

1031
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,079
you have these libraries built around

1032
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,239
experiences it's true yeah that's like a

1033
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,359
tribe of Terps I love it you know it's

1034
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,279
uh I mean it's so you know and the thing

1035
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,139
about it is it's like we in cannabis

1036
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,940
were very much keyed into that part of

1037
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:35,039
it like that's where we're at now you

1038
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,019
know like the cannabinoid thing is not

1039
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,338
all figured out but definitely we have a

1040
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,259
lot of information when it comes to the

1041
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:42,539
cannabinoids and now the next Frontier

1042
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,460
is the chirpings how do they affect the

1043
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,199
experience of cannabis you know like of

1044
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,358
course things smell good or don't smell

1045
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,799
good to people uh but they smell like

1046
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,739
something and they definitely draw a

1047
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,900
reaction from you and and uh you know

1048
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:56,399
it's it's it's the new frontier like we

1049
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,440
are just on the you know we're just

1050
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,720
learning about it however these things

1051
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,820
are not new they're everywhere on Earth

1052
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,679
every human has had experience with

1053
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,180
something that smells good something

1054
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,819
that smells bad something that smells

1055
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,559
dangerous something that smells and so

1056
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,260
it's a part of the human experience it's

1057
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,838
part of our DNA it's part of our our you

1058
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,700
know our synapse system it's it's all in

1059
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,400
our head and it's it's meant to be here

1060
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:22,980
for us and we're here for it as it turns

1061
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,079
out too as you know Growers and breeders

1062
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,760
and you know in all kinds of fields

1063
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,980
across not just cannabis of course but

1064
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,480
right um I love that I think that's

1065
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,219
amazing I think it's it's always

1066
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,079
something more interesting coming down

1067
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:36,059
the pike with it never gets old right

1068
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,680
when it gets old you know and now that

1069
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:39,358
things are going legal it's like now

1070
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,578
scientists can get involved in

1071
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,358
universities and bigger you know bigger

1072
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:46,619
and more powerful and more well-funded

1073
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:48,480
organizations can kind of get into this

1074
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,858
stuff and break it down and we all get

1075
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,079
to see what happens we all get to learn

1076
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:53,519
about it and how it relates to us and

1077
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,140
the relationship we have with these

1078
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,358
things and the combinations of them and

1079
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,759
what they do to our psyche what they how

1080
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,380
do they impact our life even

1081
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,359
um how do they enhance our life you know

1082
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,980
and it's it's amazing you know and it's

1083
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,739
it's been around since the beginning of

1084
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,380
time on Earth and you know now we're you

1085
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:13,858
know we're Alchemists of Terps now in a

1086
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,079
sense Styles you know files like the the

1087
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:18,659
skunks and the gas like basically the

1088
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,119
gas the the rocket feel all these things

1089
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:23,219
are Styles and it that's why it's also

1090
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,660
so hard to measure them in terpenes

1091
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,459
because they're not terpenes necessarily

1092
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:28,618
the things that we really appreciate

1093
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,838
where the gas were you know you can talk

1094
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,119
about terpenoline and limonene for hazes

1095
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,858
and we can talk about mercy and some

1096
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,079
other things but once we start talking

1097
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:38,460
about thiles tiles are really where

1098
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,420
there's there's a lot of magic and

1099
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,599
there's a lot of stuff we don't

1100
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,519
understand and uh these relationships

1101
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,440
with the cannabinoids and terpenes and

1102
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,239
we're just starting to scratch the

1103
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,559
surface of it I really believe that you

1104
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,779
know we'll have a better understanding

1105
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,179
over the next five to ten years

1106
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,760
but uh you know it's it's amazing to be

1107
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:58,618
on the frontier it is I agree with you I

1108
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,820
I've thought about it and it's uh you

1109
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:01,680
know when people come through the door

1110
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,300
they you know they want the all right

1111
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,699
what's your highest percentage of THC

1112
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,859
and so the that of course I can't help

1113
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:09,899
myself and you know the people who work

1114
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:11,519
here with me my team we're all on the

1115
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,500
same page with this like you can't help

1116
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,239
yourself take a moment and just see can

1117
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,099
we talk about that with this individual

1118
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,559
for a minute and try to educate this

1119
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:21,420
individual about why that's not that

1120
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,559
important why it really doesn't mean

1121
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,139
that much

1122
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,838
um and we have some strains uh on the

1123
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:28,589
table here that have low uh THC and you

1124
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:29,820
know 19

1125
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,740
[Music]

1126
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,300
um and but they're amazing experiences

1127
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:35,939
it's almost

1128
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,000
uh you can't say that something with 10

1129
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,099
more is actually stronger and it you

1130
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,480
know why do why is it like that well I

1131
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,160
mean we know a little bit we know that

1132
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,480
brain chemistry changes from Individual

1133
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,819
to individuals well that's a big part of

1134
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,559
it we know that the cannabinoids are you

1135
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,838
know they fit together in different ways

1136
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,059
like a puzzle to

1137
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,920
um you know to impress the THC on your

1138
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,099
on your on your you know nervous system

1139
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,000
your endocannabinoid system and uh and

1140
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:02,460
that can change the experience

1141
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,719
regardless of the THC and then now we're

1142
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,679
at the point like you said we're at the

1143
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:06,719
point now where we're starting to

1144
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,578
discover that different combinations of

1145
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,039
terpenes have different effects on

1146
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,720
cannabinoids and how they relate and

1147
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,239
communicate with our brain and our

1148
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,618
nervous system and under endocannabinoid

1149
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,078
system all through our body and it's

1150
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:21,300
like we're just on the cusp of this and

1151
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,980
to think that like I'll always like to

1152
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,619
use lavender as an example because it's

1153
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,539
like a single plant like cannabis is so

1154
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:29,338
it's like when you smell no one's ever

1155
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:31,199
repulsed by that like I don't think I've

1156
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,299
ever heard anyone go I can't stand the

1157
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,759
smell of lavender you know even in large

1158
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,460
doses of it I think it's like it's a

1159
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,220
universal kind of calming you know

1160
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,838
relaxing kind of like bringing peace and

1161
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:45,358
like changes your breathing it changes

1162
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:46,799
your heart rate even and that's science

1163
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,539
you know that's not because it smells

1164
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,920
good it is but there's more to it than

1165
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:52,619
that your brain is interacting with

1166
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,200
those terpenes and allowing you to have

1167
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,420
that experience of just calmness you

1168
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,598
know and cannabis is that on steroids

1169
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,659
it's it's when it's good it works it's

1170
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,460
it's uh it can enhance your life to a

1171
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:07,019
degree that it's it's hard to measure

1172
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,358
you know it's hard for anyone to measure

1173
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:10,559
you know even us you know day in and day

1174
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,719
out this is what we do it's hard to

1175
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,639
measure how important that can be you

1176
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,078
know I've always known this about well

1177
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,719
I've known this for a long time about

1178
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,760
cannabis that we have a symbiotic and a

1179
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,819
real time relationship with cannabis

1180
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,079
that you know where as as Growers we're

1181
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,880
like what do you need you know we're

1182
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,220
like we're checking you out you can't

1183
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,599
speak to me you know you can't like you

1184
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:31,919
can't point you can't do anything but

1185
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,900
you're still speaking to me you're

1186
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,579
trying to tell me what do you need and

1187
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,680
the plants also

1188
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,420
was probably a much more success than we

1189
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,399
have with it because you know we're like

1190
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,380
kind of monkey brain you know we think

1191
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,358
too fast and you know pay attention

1192
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,920
enough we're hardly listen enough the

1193
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,420
plan has no choice but to listen that

1194
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,338
plant can't get up and walk across the

1195
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,920
room and take care of its own needs and

1196
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:53,940
so it has to communicate with us and you

1197
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,920
know like we were just saying it

1198
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,200
communicates through the cannabinoid

1199
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,000
system of course and also uh you know

1200
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,219
the camera the cannabinoids in it and

1201
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,659
also the terpenes in it and and I think

1202
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,279
that's where we're at now like you know

1203
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:08,519
we've all been stoned out of our mind on

1204
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,320
THC and um combinations of caminoids but

1205
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:11,519
now the terpenes have got another thing

1206
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,440
to tell us and I think that's where

1207
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,079
we're at I think they're the plants are

1208
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,119
trying to speak up and say hey we have a

1209
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,800
solution here you know you just got to

1210
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,480
listen you got to listen you got to take

1211
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,339
a moment you got to stop and smell the

1212
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,858
[ __ ] roses and it's going to be okay

1213
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:28,078
you know everyone loves this I know you

1214
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:29,578
do I do we all do you know I know you do

1215
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,920
because we're all humans you know right

1216
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,420
and that's our nature you know so it's

1217
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,858
just amazing because we're you know like

1218
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,139
you said we're right we're on a frontier

1219
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:38,098
at the beginning of it and you know I

1220
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:40,858
can't wait to see what's going to happen

1221
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:42,300
next for sure for sure so let's talk

1222
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,039
about breeding because you're you're

1223
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,780
into breeding you you do breeding you do

1224
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,179
funeral hunting you got lucky dog seed

1225
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,920
company which I love it because I feel

1226
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:51,539
like there's only a handful of guys that

1227
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,059
are really stuck to their Roots you know

1228
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:55,559
I'm I'm more of about diversity as far

1229
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:57,659
as my palate has always been concerned

1230
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,219
I'm always trying to explore and find

1231
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:01,440
the new thing but you really kind of

1232
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:04,559
have stuck to your roots with the chem

1233
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,420
dog with the genetics and doing uh some

1234
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,858
cool back crosses and you you do

1235
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,380
incorporate some new genetics as well

1236
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:12,480
but I feel like you've you know JJ from

1237
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,640
Top Dog he's another one I feel like you

1238
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,599
guys have really held strong in your

1239
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,838
beliefs

1240
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,700
right well the way I look at it and it

1241
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:22,739
this is not something I had like a you

1242
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:24,239
know a strategy at one point it's

1243
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,098
something that's kind of happened and

1244
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,318
here we are but

1245
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:31,440
um you know I love the chem dog you know

1246
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,539
like I I tell people this I have I have

1247
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,519
you know you know you go through life

1248
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,019
and you have you say the love of my life

1249
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,880
right and what the hell does that mean

1250
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:41,639
you start off and for me it was my mom

1251
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,619
you know she was like you know a saint

1252
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:46,440
you know like a goddess to me like she

1253
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:47,940
no nothing could outdo her I fell in

1254
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,740
love with it I still always will and

1255
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,480
then you know and then you know I love

1256
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:52,679
football so when I was a young man I

1257
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,900
fell in love with the San Francisco

1258
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,759
49ers long before I even counted the Bay

1259
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,920
Area and that's the love of my life like

1260
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,440
I can't wait till the season starts and

1261
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,659
then what's next well a lot of stuff

1262
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,960
happened after but it came to the

1263
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,578
chemdot you know and I love her and I I

1264
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,740
like to believe that she loves me too

1265
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,420
she all I I think that these things find

1266
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,039
their stewards whatever it's nothing

1267
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,559
special about me that's not what I'm

1268
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:18,300
saying but I'm it's what I tell people

1269
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,578
is like you know when I talk to my

1270
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,380
customers about having a clone for you

1271
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:24,119
know 28 years

1272
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,460
um you know it takes them a minute to

1273
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,720
process that and when they do I'm like

1274
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,059
you know

1275
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,000
um you know it's like I've been through

1276
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:35,940
all this stuff in life you know and you

1277
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,159
know deaths friends dying dogs dying you

1278
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,280
know the worst pains the highest of ties

1279
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,440
the joys you know marriage divorce

1280
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,319
raising a kid and there she is she's

1281
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,240
still right there you know and so

1282
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,818
um I just want to inject what we've done

1283
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,519
in the past what back into it you know

1284
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:55,199
so you know at some time you're like

1285
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,519
well I was just getting stale well for

1286
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,559
me it's not because that's what we're

1287
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,539
still doing you know and it's it's a lot

1288
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,179
of fun you know because you go through

1289
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:04,858
the you know the mothers you know like

1290
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:06,539
the pollen receivers that you're you

1291
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:08,400
know potential and you you get to learn

1292
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,039
them you find out them you give flavors

1293
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,318
the experience the like the effect all

1294
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,940
these things and then we cross it with

1295
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:16,858
our chem dog and then we have a whole

1296
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,019
new thing and it happens that way and

1297
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:21,119
the funny thing about Kim dog is is that

1298
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:23,460
even though she's old old girl like

1299
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,079
she's dominating when she when you cross

1300
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,179
her and that was the hardest part about

1301
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:30,180
developing that that stud that I've been

1302
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:31,679
using is that that the first several

1303
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:33,419
attempts

1304
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,219
um it was just too dominating you know

1305
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,500
like everything came too much like Kim

1306
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:39,779
dog because when you do back crosses you

1307
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,400
know that's what you're selecting for

1308
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,079
um so I started to kind of change my

1309
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,480
strategy of selecting as I was going

1310
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,640
through it and maybe just you know

1311
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,318
finding certain aspects I love just

1312
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,078
about a plant not necessarily like Kim

1313
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:54,599
dog but like you know Vigor and

1314
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,700
structure and just explosive growth and

1315
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,920
you know I want someone to pop a seed

1316
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:00,239
and just it just blows up and blows

1317
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,760
their [ __ ] mind you know and that's

1318
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,500
that's to me is has to be part of it you

1319
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,359
know a person is going to grow you know

1320
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,980
have a lightener and attend their house

1321
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:09,239
like you know they don't want to they're

1322
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,740
not gonna go through a hundred thousand

1323
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,118
cuts to find the one they want to you

1324
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:14,399
know they want to have like they want

1325
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,200
some success and they may be limited on

1326
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,838
their knowledge they may be limited on

1327
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,818
their resources on what they can apply

1328
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:23,099
to their project and I want them to be

1329
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:25,500
happy so so I started kind of selecting

1330
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,660
not just for chemdog traits as far as

1331
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,960
Aroma flavor and effect though but also

1332
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:32,879
like structure it's Vigor you know

1333
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,318
um and then that kind of once I went

1334
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,838
down that road everything kind of

1335
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,519
happened quick and we found one that and

1336
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:40,380
so how did we find that out like how do

1337
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,659
we know we found it well we crossed it

1338
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,818
to a lot of things that that I I when I

1339
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:48,000
say we I mean me cross it to a lot of

1340
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:50,279
things and then finding out that you're

1341
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,559
getting some unique crosses you know

1342
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,599
like f ones that are actually unique and

1343
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,119
then bringing up the F1 you know

1344
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,220
generation also not too much variety

1345
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,500
like what when you buy a pack of seeds

1346
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:02,939
of course you want to like kind of get

1347
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,920
what you think you're getting you know

1348
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,500
like you want to be surprised pleasantly

1349
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,639
but you don't want to just be like I

1350
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,838
don't know I don't know what they're all

1351
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,139
different you know you don't want that

1352
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:15,719
so I guess I if I'm a breeder it would

1353
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:17,460
be because what I do is I make those and

1354
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,279
then I go through them and I try to weed

1355
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,500
out the stuff that has got too wide of a

1356
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,680
variety or of course if they're just not

1357
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,940
not a good mix and it's not desirable

1358
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,618
um and then the win the ones that make

1359
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,559
it through they got you know you could

1360
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:33,660
say two three you know different types

1361
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,059
of phenos that you can count on being in

1362
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:38,159
there but certainly one that you planned

1363
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:39,838
on seeing if that's who you are and if

1364
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:43,259
you wanted to be surprised but you

1365
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,420
wanted some really strong powerful tasty

1366
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,880
gorgeous can well you know mostly words

1367
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:51,059
scans depending on how you look at

1368
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,160
um you would want to uh you that can be

1369
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:55,679
in there as well you know so that's all

1370
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:57,299
it is and you know we have we're now

1371
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,219
branching out different ways we're going

1372
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,140
to be doing we got some collaborations

1373
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:02,459
coming up with breeders you've heard of

1374
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:04,019
that are you know just in the beginning

1375
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,119
stages

1376
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:07,920
um but to up to to this point this is

1377
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,780
what we we've been doing and we're going

1378
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,280
to always continue doing that but now

1379
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,140
it's time to Branch out now we're

1380
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,119
breeding with our own in-house things

1381
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:17,460
that we've made you know like Steps

1382
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,980
along the way that we found

1383
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,858
um so you know now it's going to change

1384
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,199
a little bit it's going to expand and

1385
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:28,139
I'm more focused on what I would like to

1386
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,719
see from Lucky Dog seed company is kind

1387
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:32,639
of like you know like there's there's

1388
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,318
like a division in cannabis culture like

1389
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,318
you have like this old school like you

1390
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,300
say gassy and you know ogs and cushions

1391
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:40,800
maybe and you know that kind of stuff

1392
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,000
and then you have like the newer thing

1393
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,500
you know and the newer thing is just

1394
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,838
taking off and that's amazing it's

1395
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,579
amazing to see but

1396
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,500
um it would be instead you know what

1397
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,420
I've learned about the older school

1398
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,400
people is they're jaded you know as

1399
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,280
older folks get you know like oh well

1400
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,838
back of my day I mean I get caught I

1401
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,000
caught my I catch myself doing that too

1402
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,739
but I don't think that's useful to sit

1403
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,318
in the corner and Snicker at the others

1404
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:06,179
you know at other aspects of cannabis

1405
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,800
culture I don't think that's useful I

1406
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:09,539
never have thought that like division

1407
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,160
was helpful

1408
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:14,519
um of course it's inevitable at times

1409
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:16,379
depending but I would rather like do

1410
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,380
collaborations with with some of those

1411
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,838
breeders and and and that style of of

1412
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,000
cannabis that part of the culture and

1413
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,679
just kind of like you know maybe a

1414
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,318
little educating maybe a little bit of

1415
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,059
just like enhancing and maybe just like

1416
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,739
creating things that are even better

1417
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:33,480
than either either side of that I mean I

1418
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:35,219
think that's the goal is to you know

1419
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,019
it's like if you're just breeding to

1420
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:38,578
cross these things together and you're

1421
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:40,739
not improving the genetics on either

1422
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,818
side what are you doing it for you know

1423
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:44,399
at the end of the day we're trying to

1424
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:46,019
improve things and like I think chem 91

1425
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,400
is an amazing classic but there's

1426
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:49,559
definitely improvements that can be made

1427
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,358
with the structure that's a good example

1428
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,400
exactly you know and that would be like

1429
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,440
reverse what I'm saying and that's I've

1430
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,940
had that experience like I get plants

1431
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,338
you know now that I'm like wow look at

1432
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,920
that it's amazing but it smells you know

1433
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:04,318
to me it's like the unique odor and you

1434
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,180
know Aromas and flavors

1435
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,159
um that I'm into I mean the high is

1436
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:10,139
always going to be top for me because I

1437
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,299
just some stuff you know in my customers

1438
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,578
verifies like oh yeah you know I was

1439
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,560
getting this such and such this place

1440
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:18,240
and it just doesn't get me stoned I

1441
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,739
smoke every day I love it everything but

1442
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,719
it's got to get me stone you know and

1443
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:23,578
I'm like yeah I get it and then I pull

1444
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,139
out you know some Crossroad chem I'm

1445
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,640
like I think you're gonna love the

1446
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:28,500
flavor of this I think it's going to hit

1447
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:30,420
you hard and I think it's going to get

1448
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,818
you stoned exactly every time you smoke

1449
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,559
it and it's true you know because Kim

1450
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:37,679
dog has that magical cape you know

1451
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,119
character you know and uh Sour Diesel

1452
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,799
all these types of things they're always

1453
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,300
going to get you rip roller Stone the

1454
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,818
way you like to be no matter what and

1455
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,220
for sure I mean really it comes down to

1456
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:49,980
that you know yeah and there's not a lot

1457
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:51,539
of stuff that you you you know you build

1458
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,338
a tolerance to it to a degree but it's

1459
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:54,838
not like so many other things you have

1460
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:56,519
the green cracks out there and stuff

1461
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:58,679
that you know where it's like a week

1462
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:01,800
later it doesn't get you high chem box

1463
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:04,199
Sour Diesel Sour Diesel at 14 will give

1464
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,180
you couch lock you know oh yeah plus the

1465
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:09,960
Terps you know I think refiring the

1466
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:13,139
joints uh is a true test and the the

1467
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,659
chem 91 all the all the chem dogs sour

1468
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:17,338
diesels a lot of the crosses even you

1469
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:18,659
get that you know Roach Burn where you

1470
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:21,239
fire a road chip and it still tastes

1471
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:23,219
good exactly yeah that's important too

1472
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,358
like all the way down to the end that

1473
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:32,098
sweet sweet grippy you know

1474
00:51:26,358 --> 00:51:33,659
gotta happen so uh as far as uh what

1475
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,579
substrate do you grow in what kind of

1476
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:37,500
nutrients are you using what it what is

1477
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,640
uh your philosophy on growing and

1478
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,480
cultivation

1479
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:43,618
well we here keep an even open mind when

1480
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,619
it comes to our nutrients we grow in

1481
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:48,780
Cocoa we grow in pots we we uh you know

1482
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,160
drain the waste of course we try to do a

1483
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,780
little crop steering you know dick

1484
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,179
around that

1485
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,980
um lately what we've been doing is uh

1486
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:57,539
we've tried different when I opened this

1487
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,639
place uh several of the nutrient

1488
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:01,800
companies that are well known they

1489
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:03,539
reached out to do their marketing and

1490
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,680
the way a lot of it goes down is I'm

1491
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:06,719
sure you understand that they'll like

1492
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:08,219
send you a whole crop load of of their

1493
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,719
products and say hey will you run this

1494
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:12,480
you know you know this and that see what

1495
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:15,779
you think so we did that and my program

1496
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,300
that I had down in uh Sonoma County for

1497
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:21,180
for a good while now for almost you know

1498
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,920
almost 20 years really always works well

1499
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,419
for me you know

1500
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,358
um you know I used to grow organically

1501
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,680
in the 90s and in the early 2000s and I

1502
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,598
had a lot of success with it but as

1503
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:32,399
things got bigger it just wasn't it

1504
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:34,200
wasn't sustainable for me

1505
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,780
um to have the keep the quality up the

1506
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:39,058
way it needed to be and so uh you know I

1507
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,240
got turned onto Hydroponics and and you

1508
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:44,160
know salt-based nutrients and such and

1509
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:45,899
um so up here I couldn't get some of

1510
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,420
that stuff the shipping on liquids is

1511
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,920
really expensive and you know a lot of

1512
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,780
it's not even available here so I had to

1513
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,240
kind of open up you know the mind and

1514
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,819
think outside the box and so we've tried

1515
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:59,338
all kinds of stuff we've tried the

1516
00:52:56,818 --> 00:53:00,960
Athena it was okay we had a we had

1517
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:02,639
pretty good success with it I mean the

1518
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,699
buds were big and all that but it didn't

1519
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:08,159
uh it kind of the the final product was

1520
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:09,659
a little less than desirable for me yeah

1521
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,460
for me it all tastes like Athena that's

1522
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:13,199
my my complaint with Athena it looks

1523
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,659
great but I feel like that it tastes

1524
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:16,919
like Athena and not you know I think a

1525
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:20,639
lot of people get good results with

1526
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,980
Athena but it's not my cup of tea yeah

1527
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,558
um and I agree with that and uh however

1528
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:28,139
so you know we right now we're running a

1529
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,359
veg Bloom from hydroponic research and

1530
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:32,039
we like it just fine

1531
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:33,900
um so we we had this interesting

1532
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:35,579
experience you know like the Athena has

1533
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,019
that new product called fade where they

1534
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,640
you know people a lot of people were

1535
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,980
complaining about how harsh the weed was

1536
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,618
too much nitrogen at the end or whatever

1537
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:46,079
and so uh you know they sent some of

1538
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:48,180
that out we tried it out and we actually

1539
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,280
for the first time in a long time I have

1540
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:51,719
to be honest like they said you know

1541
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,339
plant Health at the ends you know the

1542
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,379
problem with hydroponic growing is the

1543
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:57,119
flush you know of course we all know and

1544
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,480
the plant starts eating itself and Kim

1545
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,160
dog is like it's like that times 10 like

1546
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,358
it gets bad you know it's like it's kind

1547
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,578
of sad like you got to get your pictures

1548
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,619
on day 56 you know

1549
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,180
um maybe even looking for it

1550
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:11,700
um so you know it starts to eat itself

1551
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:13,618
it starts to consume itself and so

1552
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:16,500
um we've been like you know getting some

1553
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:18,660
data from uh Leaf analysis the different

1554
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,099
points of time

1555
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:22,259
um we're delving into that to kind of

1556
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:23,880
see like when at what point does these

1557
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,099
things start to become consumed you know

1558
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,838
like what we what day do they start to

1559
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:30,059
get consumed and like what can we do

1560
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,440
about it and while we're doing this we

1561
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,960
know we're [ __ ] around with calcium

1562
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,420
and you know all these things and

1563
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,539
um you know not really a lot of success

1564
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:42,059
maybe some you know somewhat something

1565
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:43,259
notable uh but we did run their fate I

1566
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,480
gotta say I don't want to do like an

1567
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,220
Hatter but we did run it and the plants

1568
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,019
looked green and healthy at the end you

1569
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:50,399
know like when I say green they had you

1570
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:52,500
know a lot a lot more color they weren't

1571
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,838
like brown eaten leaves is what I mean

1572
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:57,179
nice and you know it's like I know they

1573
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:59,219
recommended we did what they said

1574
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:01,259
um and we went and all the way through

1575
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:03,179
probably gave them fresh water for three

1576
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,920
days I think and I was like yeah this

1577
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:06,539
shit's gonna burn bad it's gonna [ __ ]

1578
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,099
hurt us

1579
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:10,019
um and the thing the first thing I

1580
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:12,599
noticed we didn't have one little tiny

1581
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:14,039
Speck of Atrius and well I always have

1582
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,200
it you know the butt when the big buds I

1583
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:18,119
always have a little bit like it's not

1584
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:19,739
you know and it always occurs in those

1585
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:21,780
last two weeks you know it always occurs

1586
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:23,219
in those last seven days I mean in the

1587
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,599
in the mind it's like well of course it

1588
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,039
does you know the plant's not growing

1589
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,019
anymore it's just kind of finishing out

1590
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:29,940
you know the mold's always there the

1591
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,500
spores are always there

1592
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,179
um you know you try to keep them out but

1593
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,920
they're they get in

1594
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:36,358
um and so in in your mind you're like

1595
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,400
well of course you know that's just part

1596
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:41,219
of the deal right it's always been part

1597
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,440
of the deal but so we actually didn't

1598
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:44,699
have any and that was like it caught me

1599
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,200
off guard I was like damn because they

1600
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:47,338
didn't mention that when they talked to

1601
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:48,899
me about it when they're asking me to

1602
00:55:47,338 --> 00:55:50,759
try it out and I was like wow that's

1603
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,099
interesting so

1604
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,800
um so then what we did is we we switched

1605
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:58,200
back over to uh we did one with the veg

1606
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,880
Bloom program we just stuck with the pro

1607
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:02,338
ground we didn't do anything too far we

1608
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,500
added some some gypsumen some calcium

1609
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:06,299
carbonate and stuff like that overloaded

1610
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,300
it with that and you know

1611
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,339
um those things are a little bit more

1612
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,859
uh they didn't I don't see the results

1613
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:16,199
that I hear about with that like I I see

1614
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:18,239
some result but that the impact is not

1615
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:18,838
as what I hear it's in my experience you

1616
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:20,578
know

1617
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,558
so and then you know we had a little bit

1618
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:24,480
of tryitis and we already got it well

1619
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,920
then eventually we smoked that crap

1620
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,139
where we only gave it plain water if

1621
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,519
there's a smooth as smooth as can be so

1622
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:33,179
what we're doing now is we're going to

1623
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,619
do The Cutting Edge four part uh soluble

1624
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:36,239
powder system

1625
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:38,480
um and then we're gonna switch over in

1626
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,979
the powder powder yeah

1627
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,599
good stuff I like Uncle John I think

1628
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,159
they got a good product I think the the

1629
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,838
flavor at the end of the day I'm a

1630
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,639
flavor guy and I want my way to taste

1631
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,858
good and I think in a cocoa type

1632
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:51,480
environment it works really well I

1633
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:52,799
totally agree with you and and we were

1634
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,480
when I was talking about what I used to

1635
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,700
run before that's what it was that was

1636
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,800
the base with many other things to kind

1637
00:56:56,699 --> 00:57:00,539
of enhance it but that was the Basin I

1638
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,818
was always so happy but and like I said

1639
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:04,619
Uncle John and they're good folks man

1640
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:06,300
like they get it you know like you know

1641
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:09,000
there's a reason why I can't get it here

1642
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,800
that sucks for me but the reason I

1643
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,119
actually am I'm okay with it they don't

1644
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,559
go to the big distributor to have them

1645
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,119
they're like no we don't want to be part

1646
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,220
of that you know we'll be smaller scale

1647
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,480
we won't be able to reach everybody but

1648
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:20,818
at least we'll stay more true to our

1649
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,338
values and I respect that and that I do

1650
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:24,719
like being part of that so

1651
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:27,299
um and that's what you can't get up here

1652
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,519
so but however we're gonna

1653
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,019
um we are gonna try that just one way

1654
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,759
through all the way we haven't done that

1655
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:33,900
one yet we're gonna try that all the way

1656
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,720
through once and just see what the

1657
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,920
results are and then but really I think

1658
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,239
what our strategy is going to end up

1659
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,500
being is we're going to leave that in

1660
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:43,500
the last two weeks we're just going to

1661
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,880
do Bloom and fate and so uh you know

1662
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,099
that's kind of why I tried it out but

1663
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,838
this the fade stuff like um it worked

1664
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:50,760
like this the smoke was smooth and

1665
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:52,199
smooth as can be we still had all the

1666
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,000
flavor

1667
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,279
um and I think we're going to be able to

1668
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,960
do even better when we when we start to

1669
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,119
mix and match we don't run just one

1670
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,699
program we just take what's what works

1671
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,140
and we apply it when it needs to be you

1672
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:06,058
know when it needs to be used you know

1673
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:08,338
so I think that's kind of our strategy

1674
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:09,780
that the long story short is that we

1675
00:58:08,338 --> 00:58:11,940
just try to think outside the box

1676
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:14,339
understand what we're doing you know

1677
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,720
never ever do something without knowing

1678
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:17,219
why you're doing it because I think

1679
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:19,739
that's a big problem out there is like

1680
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:21,539
this is what you do and it's like well

1681
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:23,159
why do you do that and if something goes

1682
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,358
wrong do you know what to do you know if

1683
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,399
something starts to go a different way

1684
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:27,960
if you're trying to enhance the Terps

1685
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,880
you know what to do if you're are you

1686
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,039
trying to you know different strains

1687
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,800
require different you know uh nutrient

1688
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,719
you know requirements and so you know

1689
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,760
that's kind of you know what our

1690
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,439
strategy is it's like to I guess that's

1691
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,700
what I've been my answer to that is you

1692
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,798
know we're just trying to mix and match

1693
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:46,739
and find what works with us but Athena

1694
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:48,659
Fades part of it no that's awesome I

1695
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:52,019
love hearing stories like that

1696
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:53,460
so I got a question for you okay if you

1697
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:54,900
were to uh

1698
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,838
with all the knowledge that you've

1699
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:00,000
gathered over the years and you were to

1700
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,400
go talk to your younger self that had

1701
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
been doing this for about two years what

1702
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,619
piece of advice would you give yourself

1703
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,659
well the first piece of advice that

1704
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:13,260
still stands true today

1705
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:15,118
that I did get was uh never ever ever

1706
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,440
think you haven't figured out never ever

1707
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,700
ever

1708
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,920
um

1709
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:21,298
speak when someone else is telling you

1710
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,039
something you know like if someone's

1711
00:59:21,298 --> 00:59:24,539
sharing what their experience is and

1712
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,460
their knowledge if they've been growing

1713
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:27,838
for one year to have it you should still

1714
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,818
listen because you're probably still

1715
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,318
going to learn something from the minute

1716
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:32,460
and this is the way I was presented to

1717
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,599
be the minute you think you have it all

1718
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,240
figured out is the minute you're gonna

1719
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,280
start failing because you know your

1720
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,139
confidence and let's just say ego and

1721
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,599
you know you've made it by yourself now

1722
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:44,400
and so that that advice still Rings true

1723
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,140
like I always remember that yeah I have

1724
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,639
learned a lot you know I surely have but

1725
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:49,558
that doesn't mean I can't learn

1726
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,779
something from someone much younger than

1727
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,579
me and less experience for me and so

1728
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,380
that was good advice and if I had to

1729
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:56,880
give myself advice then I would say

1730
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,798
share what you've learned you know like

1731
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,539
as you learn things be more open about a

1732
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,519
share it you know

1733
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:04,199
um that's pretty much it though I guess

1734
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:06,000
you know I don't really have a great

1735
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:07,379
answer for that one I don't really know

1736
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,818
I mean I think that was a great answer

1737
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,900
to be honest with you I think that was

1738
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:12,779
really good

1739
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,700
right on yeah because I feel like it was

1740
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,200
it's it's been difficult for me to come

1741
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:18,598
out of the shows like I've had a hard

1742
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:20,219
time with it you know like we of course

1743
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,539
we were going cannabis of course that

1744
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:22,919
could get you a lot of trouble we were

1745
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:25,380
also involved with some other crazy [ __ ]

1746
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,019
and it's just you know it was a culture

1747
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,818
of like you got to keep your lips sipped

1748
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:30,960
you got to like you gotta walk the line

1749
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:33,179
don't let anyone know what you're doing

1750
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,400
you know like I I've done years people

1751
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:37,679
great good friends close friends can

1752
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,298
come to my house and they would be you

1753
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,098
know they buy weed from it they get

1754
01:00:39,298 --> 01:00:43,318
tupperware's super skunk and chem dog

1755
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:45,000
from me they knew I was growing it they

1756
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:46,558
never would hear me admit it you know

1757
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,239
they would they stopped asking me like

1758
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,040
do you grow this week I'm like dude I

1759
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,739
told you you know I don't know and don't

1760
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:54,539
ask me that you know so I took that a

1761
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:57,298
little too far I think and I would if I

1762
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:59,279
had anything to change about my somewhat

1763
01:00:57,298 --> 01:01:02,280
younger self I would I would have made

1764
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,200
that decision sooner for me the law

1765
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,760
enforcement did that for me you know

1766
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:07,500
ironically

1767
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,740
um you know when they came and rated me

1768
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,199
in 2014 well they took everything from

1769
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:15,419
me Plants included

1770
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:17,399
um I got arrested for uh like nine

1771
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,858
felonies you know manufacturing

1772
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,139
controlled substance all the way down to

1773
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:24,358
possession with the intent and control

1774
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:26,818
you know manuf uh possession of

1775
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:28,679
concentrated cannabis you know uh you

1776
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:30,119
know and of course the manufacturing of

1777
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:31,558
a controlled substance being the most

1778
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,838
serious of those crimes it's a very

1779
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:35,519
serious crime it it carries a potential

1780
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:39,599
of seven years in the penitentiary in

1781
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:42,059
California so you know they had every in

1782
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,980
their mind they had every right to take

1783
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:45,960
my life away from me

1784
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,059
um and they did a very very good job at

1785
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,099
that you know um I mean my daughter was

1786
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:53,460
living with me more than half the time

1787
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:55,740
she had more uh her custody was uh with

1788
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,720
me more than 50 percent of the time uh

1789
01:01:55,739 --> 01:01:59,399
because her mom worked a lot more than I

1790
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:01,259
you know I worked at home because I had

1791
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,358
grows around the county and down in

1792
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,280
Oakland and so I had more flexible

1793
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:06,719
schedules that was the reason why but

1794
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,040
that all suddenly ended the day they

1795
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:10,019
came and kicked the door in you know

1796
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:11,759
what I mean all the doors influenced you

1797
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:14,159
know and so

1798
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,020
um you know my life changed quickly and

1799
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,298
rapidly and it seemed like a kick in the

1800
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:20,519
[ __ ] nuts and of course it was but it

1801
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:22,199
didn't take me too long after that

1802
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:24,358
um to realize that they actually done me

1803
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:27,358
a favor I was on a hamster wheel that

1804
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:29,578
was going nowhere I mean I was just

1805
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,619
working my ass off to pay the bills so I

1806
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,880
could grow another crop you know and you

1807
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:34,380
know maybe I mean I was having a lot of

1808
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,539
fun in life of course we were making

1809
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,460
money but you know

1810
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:40,920
um but the bottom line is is like I was

1811
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:43,318
working too much it was just too much

1812
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,659
um and it was going nowhere it was the

1813
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:47,818
beginning of the end for that lifestyle

1814
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:49,858
I guess you could say in California at

1815
01:02:47,818 --> 01:02:53,099
least and really everywhere now probably

1816
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:54,838
most places and so it allowed me to

1817
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:56,280
forcefully

1818
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,500
you know put me in a different position

1819
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,900
where it's like well what now you know

1820
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:03,239
and and uh and then that's when I

1821
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,099
started to say you know what I you know

1822
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:06,598
I'm gonna focus on on making good

1823
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:08,818
genetics you know and sharing with

1824
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:11,818
people people always ask me that you

1825
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:13,318
know for clones and for genetics and you

1826
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:15,298
know for seeds and stuff like that and

1827
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:17,519
so it just seemed like an opportunity

1828
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:19,380
all of a sudden and just get through the

1829
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:20,940
probation get through all the the things

1830
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,099
that I had to do the community service

1831
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,139
and all the stuff that they make you do

1832
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,940
and you know all the sleepless nights of

1833
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,980
oh my God I'm still growing weed up in a

1834
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,659
house I know they know where I live I

1835
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,280
mean not that I told them but they know

1836
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:33,960
where I live and

1837
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,240
um they could come any minute and you

1838
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,798
know so lots of stress and you know I'm

1839
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,019
actually grateful that it happened to me

1840
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:41,519
I really am I mean it was hard and you

1841
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:43,798
know losing everything that you've

1842
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:46,559
worked for in a Flash is nothing not

1843
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:48,838
never going to be easily accepted or

1844
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,819
it's never going to be easy no and you

1845
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:52,980
know it's like uh but but these

1846
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:55,259
opportunities give us chances to start

1847
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,719
over and you know they really really

1848
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,579
help you learn who you who you really

1849
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:01,318
are you know I think everything in life

1850
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:03,119
I think things happen for a reason I

1851
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:06,239
mean I I've seen too many things in life

1852
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:08,579
to know the things in life happen for a

1853
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:10,798
reason and we have setbacks and you know

1854
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:12,180
that there's there's always ups and

1855
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:13,318
downs and that you know if you're up

1856
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:14,399
there's always going to be times where

1857
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:15,539
you're gonna be down and if you're down

1858
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,338
there's always going to be times where

1859
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:18,960
you're up again yeah and you can't

1860
01:04:17,338 --> 01:04:20,578
appreciate one of the other you know

1861
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,559
without the other you know you got to

1862
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:24,480
have that contrast you know and right

1863
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,400
it's just life I mean you know you don't

1864
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,679
when you do what we do like sitting

1865
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,059
around feeling sorry for yourself is it

1866
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,440
ain't gonna work out like you got to

1867
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:33,720
keep on moving but it was it was

1868
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,119
humbling because you know I was you know

1869
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:37,798
40 something and I'm 50 now I was 40

1870
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:39,480
something and I'm like now I'm around

1871
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:41,280
all my friends who I've been giving cuts

1872
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,838
to you know oh my God I lost the chem

1873
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,819
dog cut again can you give me another

1874
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:46,558
now they're building like businesses and

1875
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:48,779
you're over here going you're struggling

1876
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,660
you know and it was humbling it was hard

1877
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,339
and the character building really like I

1878
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:56,399
got back to my roots about who I am like

1879
01:04:53,338 --> 01:04:58,798
the things about me who that I was

1880
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,420
starting not to like like you know those

1881
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:01,858
things were not important anymore you

1882
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,539
know like they weren't part of who I was

1883
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:05,699
suddenly and I was grateful for that

1884
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:08,519
like truly grateful for that and I still

1885
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:10,199
am and you know it's like you said it's

1886
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:12,119
like one thing leads to another you know

1887
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:15,118
and that I'm in Bozeman Montana it's the

1888
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:16,920
last grace place on Earth I mean it just

1889
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,599
doesn't get for me it doesn't get any

1890
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,119
better than this I love the people here

1891
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:23,640
I can walk you know 10 minutes away I've

1892
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,079
got my hot springs you know 20 minutes

1893
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:27,420
away I've got like the most beautiful

1894
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:29,460
hike that you can imagine if I want I

1895
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:31,740
can go 25 miles out into the Wilderness

1896
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,420
you got to bring your bare mace the

1897
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:35,519
Moose is the most dangerous animals out

1898
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,798
here but besides that I mean it's heaven

1899
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,259
on Earth and I love it and so without

1900
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:41,818
that event happening to me in 2014 I

1901
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,740
wouldn't be sitting here and I'm fully

1902
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:45,000
aware of that and there's not not been a

1903
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,979
moment where I wasn't aware of it and

1904
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,079
I'm grateful even on the hardest of days

1905
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,880
I'm grateful so yeah yeah it's contrast

1906
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:52,500
you know it's a it's it's how you

1907
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,900
appreciate life it's how you appreciate

1908
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,358
things it's how you not become bored and

1909
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,380
complacent is by having things in your

1910
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,179
life that have happened that you can

1911
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:02,039
look back and go man I can't believe I

1912
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:04,618
went through that I'm still I'm still

1913
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:06,900
here you know when you get knocked down

1914
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:07,980
you get back up and you keep working and

1915
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,260
I think

1916
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,760
you know I've had bouts of depression

1917
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,440
through my life or whatever but I think

1918
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,359
the biggest thing for me is just to keep

1919
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,798
working and keep driving and I don't

1920
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:18,539
have a lot of work-life balance with

1921
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:21,719
what I do right now but I will someday

1922
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:24,179
and I I'm okay with that you know yeah I

1923
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:26,219
don't either at all but I mean I I live

1924
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:29,460
in the shop I I have built an apartment

1925
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:31,798
here because you know it's what I had to

1926
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,940
do you know like going out it's very

1927
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:34,199
expensive here a lot of people don't

1928
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,940
understand that about this place it's

1929
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:37,739
you know Tom Brady lives here you know

1930
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:40,318
like Bill Gates lived here you know like

1931
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:42,298
it's a very very wealthy place and so

1932
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,699
you know buying or renting a house

1933
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:46,619
around here is is it's it's gonna take a

1934
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:49,019
lot you know so I live here and I don't

1935
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:51,240
mind it at all I love it being near my

1936
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:52,559
plants I get up my dispensaries my

1937
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,538
living room it's where I sit and watch

1938
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,579
popcorn and watch my TV show you know

1939
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:58,260
it's it ain't that bad yeah when you

1940
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:02,460
love what you do man it's not that bad I

1941
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:04,260
I totally get it exactly yeah yeah so

1942
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,400
let's uh talk for a second about how

1943
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,200
everybody could find you if they're

1944
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,519
looking for seeds or they're looking you

1945
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:10,379
know genetic seeds if they're looking

1946
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:12,538
for flower where can they find you

1947
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,680
well we got a website I think that's the

1948
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:16,680
best source we have it's uh

1949
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:16,679
www.luckydogcannabisco.com

1950
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:22,858
um we have on that website you know we

1951
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,838
have our Flower menu we have an

1952
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:27,659
integrated Flower menu

1953
01:07:24,838 --> 01:07:29,578
um about what we have daily and then we

1954
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:31,199
also have you know like if we ever had a

1955
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:32,940
strain even if we didn't keep it we'll

1956
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,818
still keep the the photos in the library

1957
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:36,900
there and it's just discontinued

1958
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,279
um because you know we're not going to

1959
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,720
try to forget it you know that doesn't

1960
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,640
mean it was you know we lose a thing

1961
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:43,500
every now and again we've lost

1962
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,779
two strains since we've had other people

1963
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,880
besides me taking care of it you know

1964
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:50,099
luckily nothing too crazy but it happens

1965
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,720
a little mix up here and there

1966
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:54,298
um so there's that and then there's a

1967
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:55,919
whole other section on the seed uh side

1968
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:58,739
of it where you can find vendors that

1969
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,059
sell Lucky Dog Seed Company seeds and

1970
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:01,439
you know learn a little bit about our

1971
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:03,119
seeds

1972
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,599
um and then we have a fun thing going on

1973
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:08,700
my cultivator his name is uh Eli but he

1974
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,680
goes by Ginger grower on the Instagram

1975
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:13,019
he's kind of he's kind of a big deal

1976
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:14,879
he's kind of famous you know but uh so

1977
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:16,259
he's the cultivator here he's like my

1978
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,779
right hand man when it comes to the

1979
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:21,659
plants and I'm lucky because if we see

1980
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:23,819
eye to eye like we totally we don't ever

1981
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:26,399
like see things differently which

1982
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:28,440
you know is amazing really when it comes

1983
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,879
to the plants you know like he

1984
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,858
understands that the plants are living

1985
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,539
creatures like our dogs and cats and our

1986
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:35,520
loved ones and that they need to be

1987
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:37,198
taken care of accordingly

1988
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,900
um and he does a great job I don't think

1989
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,879
that I could have found and I'm so lucky

1990
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:44,579
it wasn't anything I did it's just it

1991
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,159
was a lot pure luck uh someone who cares

1992
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:48,659
so much about it to the point where I

1993
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:50,698
don't even think about it when I can't

1994
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:52,019
be part of that process and that happens

1995
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:53,759
when I'm running this business and

1996
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,319
that's been a hard part for me letting

1997
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,838
go of that somewhat I've never been able

1998
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:59,580
to do that now I have to do it and I

1999
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:01,318
trust him but we have a new thing where

2000
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:03,238
we go out on that uh Trail I was talking

2001
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,279
about the Cottonwood South Cottonwood

2002
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:06,838
Trail um so we got a new blog we just

2003
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,420
started it was an idea we just popped in

2004
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,979
her head we walked out about

2005
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:13,380
um it's about three miles out to this

2006
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:15,959
Rock by the Gallatin River and we take

2007
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:17,880
one of our pre-rolls just one of our

2008
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,640
strains and we go out there me him and

2009
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:22,140
my dog El Toro and we smoke it and we

2010
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,298
just kind of recorded our experience and

2011
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:26,579
we try to be vocal about you know know

2012
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:29,100
how we feel about it and it doesn't have

2013
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:30,659
to be just okay this strain and then it

2014
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:32,640
could you know how cannabis it is like

2015
01:09:30,659 --> 01:09:34,259
it can like like we were talking earlier

2016
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,199
it can kind of invoke a thought or a

2017
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:39,420
memory or you know an idea and so we're

2018
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,919
trying to like do that every we're going

2019
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,359
to be doing every Sunday before the shop

2020
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,798
opens because we have to get back to the

2021
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,660
shop because on Sunday it's just me and

2022
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:47,100
him working here so I got to run the

2023
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:48,899
counter and he has to go out you know

2024
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,819
he's doing his plant thing but we do

2025
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:52,500
this first and it's going to be fun I'm

2026
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:53,940
really looking forward to it so you know

2027
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,800
some pictures we could be talking about

2028
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:58,379
dogs or flowers but we're gonna base it

2029
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,719
around a strain every week you know

2030
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,159
um and and I I think that's good so I

2031
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,480
think you can come there and enjoy that

2032
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:06,420
with us if you like it's just beginning

2033
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:08,159
so bear with me as I get it going but

2034
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,359
yeah I would say that's the central

2035
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:12,000
we're trying to make that the central

2036
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,399

2063
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,600
things a lot of amazing things you know

2064
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:09,479
um and then on top of that I said but to

2065
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,400
me the thing that I like about his

2066
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,019
um you know your feed or your your like

2067
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:15,000
your social media thing is like if you

2068
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,100
want to know about actual seed

2069
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,439
production or if you want to know like

2070
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,420
actual seed protection on the scale and

2071
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:23,279
what it takes and even like you know

2072
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,079
what I mean by that is like making the

2073
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:27,179
seeds you know like it's not that

2074
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,679
complicated to make sense but on scale

2075
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,000
it can be rather complicated especially

2076
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:31,800
when you're doing feminized things like

2077
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,779
that you know and I've actually learned

2078
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,239
a lot from you about

2079
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:38,460
um scaled up seed production which I'm

2080
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:40,319
fascinated with it you know so you know

2081
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,600
kudos for that you know I gotta say so

2082
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,460
I've learned a lot from you truly I got

2083
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,159
a reading book coming out that should be

2084
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:49,198
out by Thanksgiving we've been working

2085
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:51,299
on it for a long time it's been over

2086
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,039
five years and it's really detailed and

2087
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,719
it really has a lot of good information

2088
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:56,640
and I have some of the best people

2089
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,260
besides myself some of the best people

2090
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,940
in the industry that have contributed to

2091
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,199
it and I'm super excited to have it out

2092
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:04,139
and I'll definitely be giving you a book

2093
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,519
so that's cool man I I remember reading

2094
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,780
about that at some point somewhere so

2095
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,460
that's going to be amazing it's like

2096
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:09,779
there isn't a lot of that out there you

2097
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:11,399
know there's not a lot of books about

2098
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:13,500
breeding period I mean what what do we

2099
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:15,420
got botany that's about it right so yeah

2100
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:19,319
I mean I think the Cannabis breeders

2101
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:21,658
Bible uh it's it's outdated though it's

2102
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:23,460
you know that was 25 years ago you know

2103
01:12:21,658 --> 01:12:25,158
around the time Jerry passed I think

2104
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,840
that came out so 23 years ago maybe

2105
01:12:25,158 --> 01:12:29,879
right yeah anything from that time we

2106
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,679
can't be outdated because you know the

2107
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,659
information was so limited you know so

2108
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,579
like tissue culture is a great example

2109
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:37,799
that like we're delving deep into that

2110
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:39,600
I've always been under I've been working

2111
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,760
under a hood for a long time doing other

2112
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,739
things and yeah um we're gonna actually

2113
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,060
be teaching tissue culture classes in

2114
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:47,459
Southern California

2115
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:49,500
hopefully starting right around the new

2116
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:51,060
year you know life is so busy it's hard

2117
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,260
to get everything done but

2118
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,360
um we're going to be teaching classes

2119
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:56,699
there we have a uh

2120
01:12:54,359 --> 01:12:59,099
um like a rather a large house near

2121
01:12:56,698 --> 01:13:00,960
Disneyland that my girlfriend owns

2122
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,000
um and we're going to turn the garage

2123
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,260
into like a lab I mean it's already as a

2124
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,760
lab now but like a lab where we can

2125
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:08,460
teach you know cool

2126
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:11,159
um so we can you know have companies or

2127
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,480
individuals of all types come out you

2128
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:15,000
know and it's like a bed and breakfast

2129
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,738
you stay five days you four days

2130
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,539
Hands-On you get a day off in the middle

2131
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:19,979
to go to the beach or you know go enjoy

2132
01:13:18,539 --> 01:13:22,079
the area whatever you want Disneyland

2133
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:24,539
whatever you stay there we're going to

2134
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,158
feed you you know amazing food

2135
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:27,840
um it's like paradise you know and so

2136
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:28,920
it's gonna be cool you know I'm looking

2137
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,420
forward to that that's like the next

2138
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,600
thing we're doing you know here so

2139
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:35,520
looking forward to that really cool kind

2140
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,199
of like I think the to solve the problem

2141
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,600
of some of the pathogens and you know

2142
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:42,000
the uh you know hop Layton is the one

2143
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,920
the buzzword now and a good serious

2144
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,899
thing but there's more coming you know

2145
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,340
like oh yeah there's so many more

2146
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,259
pathogens people don't understand and

2147
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,579
there's systemic bacteria and there's so

2148
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,440
much you know it's like we have a tissue

2149
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:55,140
culture lab here we do mirror stem

2150
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:57,419
excision we have a yeah we have

2151
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:58,619
We have basically clean tests for we

2152
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,179
have dirty tests that we have clean

2153
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:03,000
tests with our plants my partner Justin

2154
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:04,920
Gibbons does some amazing work and uh

2155
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,380
yeah I'm all about tissue culture it's

2156
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,719
the it's a it's a it's a good answer to

2157
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,279
a really shitty problem it is and it's

2158
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:12,899
but the thing and it's we were talking

2159
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:14,219
about the outdated book and it made me

2160
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:16,738
think of it as like

2161
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:18,119
um so you know like tissue culture is

2162
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:20,399
not a new thing it's been around since

2163
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:22,439
the 1800s yeah every Orchid you buy as

2164
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:23,759
you know comes from tissue culture but

2165
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:25,439
people you know the first time I got

2166
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:30,060
turned on to it someone handed me a

2167
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:33,178
tissue culture kit from uh uh yeah yeah

2168
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,620
Graham that's it he's like here take

2169
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:36,960
this go figure it out and tell me what

2170
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:39,420
this is good for you know so I did it

2171
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,819
was like 2006 pulled it off I have

2172
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,140
things notable tissue culture going on I

2173
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:45,119
don't even think we caught it at the

2174
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:46,560
point just tissue culture and then he's

2175
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,000
like what's it good for I said honestly

2176
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,800
I don't really know I think if you

2177
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,679
wanted to take a plant to Barcelona this

2178
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,060
would be the way to go but besides that

2179
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,679
and then the answer for all of our

2180
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,239
problems was right there and know that

2181
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,739
well not all of our problems but some of

2182
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:00,899
our problems you know now was right

2183
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:03,779
there so luckily I got a little Hands-On

2184
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:05,879
then and uh I was actually excited to

2185
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:07,259
know like oh man I'm gonna have to learn

2186
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,000
I'm gonna have to have a tissue culture

2187
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:10,500
that because I love doing lab work it's

2188
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,238
like my thing I like being under the

2189
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,219
hood I love

2190
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:16,500
sterile environments not you know like

2191
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:18,179
creating them and just I don't know what

2192
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,800
it is I just love it so it's it's good

2193
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:22,260
but I think in order for us to get

2194
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:25,560
through this we're gonna have to do more

2195
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:26,880
than a few of us offering clean you know

2196
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,039
stock we're gonna have to actually show

2197
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,079
people like this is the protocol this is

2198
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,819
how you don't spread it this is how you

2199
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:34,439
do the testing you know we're learning

2200
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:36,479
all these things in real time but more

2201
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:38,219
importantly this is what you can do to

2202
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,079
cure something don't throw it away if

2203
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:42,300
you if you know what you know what what

2204
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:44,219
I know if I can share that with you and

2205
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:46,500
if you can apply that you know you don't

2206
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:48,480
have to throw that very rare cultivar

2207
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,340
away you can maybe save it it's worth a

2208
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,439
try you have an opportunity here you

2209
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:53,699
know or or just keeping it clean in

2210
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:56,279
general like you were talking about

2211
01:15:53,698 --> 01:15:58,500
systemic pathogens just nodal tissue

2212
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:59,519
culture helps with that you know so you

2213
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,738
know all these things like if you don't

2214
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,600
grow roots for you know months then

2215
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:04,979
eventually those path the systemic

2216
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,360
pathogens in the root system they're

2217
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:07,500
eventually gonna they have no food

2218
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:09,359
they're gonna die they're gonna go

2219
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,399
somewhere else you know so

2220
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:13,259
um I love it man I'm into it oh yeah

2221
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:15,359
just I was gonna mention one more thing

2222
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:18,600
that a lucky dog Seed Company we just

2223
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:20,698
had another drop drop today we've been

2224
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,620
working on this particular drop since

2225
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:25,139
January with the testing and getting

2226
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:27,119
everything ready and selecting making

2227
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,619
sure we have what we want I just want to

2228
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,079
let everybody know that if you go to our

2229
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:33,000
website

2230
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:35,100
www.luckydog cannabisco and you go to

2231
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,619
the seed page you can see all of our

2232
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:39,539
vendors that will be carrying our drop

2233
