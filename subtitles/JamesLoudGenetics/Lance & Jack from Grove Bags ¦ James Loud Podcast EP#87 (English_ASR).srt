20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,920
amazing TPL loock bags that you know I

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,798
used I I found out about turls trip

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,640
blocks from Lance originally and I was

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
like well it feels like just another

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,478
myar bag right but then Lance is like no

25
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,560
no no this is not just another myar bag

26
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,399
and I'm like okay sure right to test

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,640
things you have to test things and and a

28
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,399
big part of what I do is I do a lot of

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,118
testing you know at the facility at the

30
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,359
house I'm always testing AB testing one

31
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,519
thing against the other right and so I

32
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,039
basically took a turkey bag I took a

33
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,199
glass jar and I took a turp blck and I

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,560
put them on the shelf and I I've

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,478
basically evaluated them from week to

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,280
week month to month and Lance was right

37
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,560
it's an amazing bag and so you guys sold

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,399
me on that now now we got a James loud

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,759
TPL loock bag the second one the 2.0 man

40
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,399
dropped it we dropped the first one on

41
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,000
this show so thought it was fitting

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,280
especially bringing the man himself you

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,318
know to to be able to debut it here but

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,000
that's what I love about you you're

45
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,479
you're like me you love testing you you

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,598
stick with stuff that you enjoy and you

47
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,039
love but you're always open to trying

48
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,039
new things and that's the same way man

49
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,598
we both grew up in NorCal we both have

50
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,959
that mentality of like the wives tailes

51
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,318
with the glass jars and all the rest so

52
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,080
I was in the same position you were when

53
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:24,958
I discovered this years ago and it's

54
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,760
like just try it man and you did and the

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,479
proof's in the pudding you know the

56
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,479
proof is in the pudding and and you

57
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,159
can't refute the data right at the end

58
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,919
of the day like you can look four months

59
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,079
down the road and you can tell the

60
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,439
difference between the stuff that's in

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,840
the turkey bag and the Mason jar and

62
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,680
I've been a mason jar guy my whole life

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,759
and I don't use mason jars anymore you

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,000
know I'm waiting for you guys to come

65
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,239
out with the Mason jar so the Turlock

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,680
mason jar right I feel like that's the

67
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,680
future but uh you guys make a great

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,319
product and it's it's easy to use it's

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,040
easy to store um and it's not just

70
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,318
another myar bag like a lot of people

71
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:02,318
think yeah yeah so I want to get down to

72
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:04,000
where this all started with you and how

73
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,318
you got started with the concept with

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
the with the tur block and everything

75
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,598
else with

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,120
Grove um for me I you gotta kind of go

77
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:16,399
back to uh kind of my relationship with

78
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,840
cannabis that's what kind of got me

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
interested and gave me ideas and got me

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,959
curious about the the plan the plan sign

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,599
so uh my older brother Charlie uh has

82
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,000
pretty severe scal policy and moved out

83
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:32,759
to to California um and he's actually

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
the the first person uh who was um

85
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,759
totally disabled to graduate from UCLA

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,799
law school so that's a his his claan of

87
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,878
Fame obviously he got all the brains in

88
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,280
the family um but um he was out here and

89
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:47,359
he got a tremendous amount of relief

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,959
from Canabis so seeing the California

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,120
medical program you know when he was

92
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,799
home uh you know growing for him um you

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,200
know producing uh growing flower for him

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,319
before he was in in California full-time

95
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,318
um learning about flower you know is

96
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,359
expensive to grow could couldn't do it

97
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,719
at your parents house was a you totally

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
different era you know your your family

99
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:09,199
could lose everything if they found a a

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,239
grow in your house then you know talk

101
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,759
you know parents careers over you know

102
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,439
Bank drop them everything so um it was

103
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,279
it was tough and it was expensive so

104
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,319
when lost lost some flour due to you

105
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,399
know not not burping it properly which

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,319
you know I really came to understand

107
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,719
that we'll dive into you know that whole

108
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,439
misn what buring burping is anyway but

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,400
the flower that just would go bad and

110
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,719
kind of difficulty with the post Harvest

111
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,439
process and a lot of stuff that I found

112
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,280
deep online was really conflicting and

113
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,439
there was a lot of conflicting uh you

114
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,079
know uh UNC opinions about qualitative

115
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,038
seniors Without Really any quantitative

116
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,758
benchmarks and then you know fast

117
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,839
forward and I'm like oh man like I can't

118
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,840
wait to go to you know this dispensary

119
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,198
in Colorado like these guys is going to

120
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,478
this this is going to be the besteller

121
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,038
it's going to blow my mind like I go to

122
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,918
dispens I'm like all right cool this is

123
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,240
a pretty nice flower and you know go and

124
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,680
pop the pop top open the next day and

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,840
something we didn't know at the time was

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,680
like those DRS lose about 1% of internal

127
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,399
relative humidity for every you know

128
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,879
hour they're exposed to an aent

129
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,439
environment cuz they that bad of barrier

130
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,279
quality but anyway pop this pop up open

131
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,399
and I'm like what the [ __ ] like this is

132
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,038
boof yeah yeah and it was it was harsh

133
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,519
it was unpleasant to smoke Turing

134
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:25,399
profiles were gone medical value is gone

135
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:27,120
I was like well there's still still this

136
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,959
problem in cannabis you know even though

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,319
we're at this point like you maybe maybe

138
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,918
there's something to really do and add

139
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,400
value here cuz uh looking ahead it's

140
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,758
like all right this industry is going to

141
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,599
be competitive you know cannabis is not

142
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,400
always going to be $6,000 a pound in the

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,400
state people are going to jump in it's

144
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,359
going to be a different Market we really

145
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,079
need a professional standard of way of

146
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,600
doing things this industry is going to

147
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,000
you know mature rapidly quality

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,600
standards are going to go up rapidly uh

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,680
competitive you know um uh the

150
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,720
competitive environment is going to

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,759
intensify rapidly the need for

152
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,160
operational superiority and operational

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,280
Excellence is going to come rapidly um

154
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,639
so you know we were always confident

155
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,638
that and when we launched Turlock as as

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,800
a a

157
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,720
product really we had been through a lot

158
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,800
of different iterations to develop the

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,440
the you know the material or turock V1

160
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,038
um and then kind of had to let the

161
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,360
markets catch up to that a little bit

162
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,719
more still not that we didn't need to

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,520
grow into the market and grow into the

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
business and continue to do a lot of you

165
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,038
know research and development and

166
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,079
deepening our understanding but also

167
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,959
cannabis was selling so fast regulated

168
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,198
markets than no one um no one had any

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,638
any concern for a post harest process if

170
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,560
you looked at someone and told them that

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,120
there was actually intense difference

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
between drawing and caring they'd look

173
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,160
at you and their eyes would glaze over

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,919
right um yeah obviously you know we're

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,599
in a very different environment today

176
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,120
very different you know and I still love

177
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,079
a fresh product don't get me wrong I

178
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,079
think Fresh Products are good I certain

179
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,839
genetics you know I think they they're

180
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,758
the best fresh and then other cultivars

181
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,758
seem to be better once they're cured

182
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,080
longer well I think you have to Define

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,960
fresh yeah and then I you know so

184
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,000
defining fresh what does fresh mean in

185
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,959
cannabis yeah is fresh and cannabis

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,439
means something that has you know

187
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,239
prominent CES Turpin because you know to

188
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,839
me I expect that's a lot of you know

189
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,000
this this broad misleading definition or

190
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,478
term freshness was really a black hole

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,199
because I think Z and candy is a great

192
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,839
great example of that you know everybody

193
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,360
says they're sick as e but most of our

194
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,758
fridges are still full of it but you

195
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,400
know that point aside most of suppos are

196
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,120
pulling down Z you know a you know 7 8 n

197
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,279
10 days early right and why are we doing

198
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,879
that it's because of those fragile

199
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,679
profiles of sess with tpin sure so when

200
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,080
we're talking freshness is because cesco

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,840
Turpin in most packaging and for most of

202
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,800
us in the the industry um you know

203
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:51,038
whether you're a prosumer homeg grower

204
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,840
you know a top not Facility have a loose

205
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,639
standard around their free versus bound

206
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,839
water and the life cycle of of product

207
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,720
moving through through their facility

208
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,000
and that's that's what's you know plays

209
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,039
into our concept of freshness I think we

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,519
we saw that with you know Z Olympics

211
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,719
recently too where you know a lot of the

212
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,598
people that I I think are the the a lot

213
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,680
of top of game players in the industry

214
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:14,079
but you know the samples you know take

215
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,000
takes a while to go through and smoke

216
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,318
all the samples if a judge going for two

217
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
three four weeks have a you know even

218
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,840
top tier product from Top tier

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,839
professionals if it's you know if we're

220
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,000
if the competition's not leveraging the

221
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:31,079
right supply chain packaging technology

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,440
not um not harnessing the right life

223
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,918
cycle so is of the right life cycle

224
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,800
product it's U it's doing a disservice

225
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,360
to to what that cultivator intended to

226
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,918
have reviewed in that competition and I

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,399
think we we've seen that you know really

228
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,519
play out and become a Forefront of

229
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,039
conversation as you know sh had time and

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,278
an opportunity to really you know get

231
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,360
scientific about about post Harvest and

232
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,240
post Harvest life cycle yeah and post

233
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,919
Harvest life cycle understanding that

234
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,240
well that's that's not just drying and

235
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,799
caring being difference between drying

236
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,079
and caring but that's drying and person

237
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,879
caring that's the life cycle of the

238
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,559
product in in my facility through

239
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,919
packaging sorting you know pre-rolls

240
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,919
whatever and that's also also the life

241
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,958
cycle of the product of the consumer

242
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,719
yeah post Harvest has been overlooked

243
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,479
for so long and it's still being

244
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,759
overlooked by a lot of communities and a

245
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,440
lot of places you know I was just in St

246
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,078
Vincent and I think there's awareness

247
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,600
and there's some people working towards

248
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,399
it but you know especially in places

249
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,440
know California is not as big of a deal

250
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,879
with post Harvest as somewhere like St

251
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,079
Vincent or the Caribbean that is super

252
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,679
humid because the humidity just destroys

253
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:34,039
turs and that's why they like our

254
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,679
product you know we've been Down To

255
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,799
Jamaica we did a trip uh the team out to

256
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,359
Thailand earlier last year um Hawaii uh

257
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,159
for their annual uh Cannabis Expo in

258
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,560
Jero those high humidity markets they

259
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,879
really love the technology because

260
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,078
they're like I'm not fighting this

261
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,399
ambient anymore you know they they don't

262
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,359
need any active atmospheric modifiers

263
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,078
that's the interesting thing is some

264
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,800
people are using humidity packs or

265
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,159
things like that that's the last thing

266
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,319
you need in those type of environments

267
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:00,360
you need something that creates that

268
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,879
barrier from that outside higher R

269
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,480
because 70 80 90% relative humidity is

270
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,480
not uncommon to your point in those

271
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,480
environments so having a technology that

272
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,519
can actually preserve that flower as

273
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,639
it's meant to be consumed by the grower

274
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,879
By You By Me by all of us that grow yeah

275
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,439
it's pivotal you know for sure

276
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,320
definitely matters yeah I think there's

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,800
there's a lot of a lot of attention

278
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,600
being being paid to um the the the

279
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,479
critical impact of the the postart cycle

280
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,839
cycle particularly on you you know

281
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,839
bottom lines of organizations I think in

282
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,200
you know especially with you know how

283
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,320
intensely competitive California Flower

284
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,040
Market is yeah for example if you're if

285
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,639
you're a grow that

286
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,519
produces let's say 1,000 lounds of of

287
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:49,200
weight of year that's 44,400 lb of of

288
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,480
flour right or grams of flour if you

289
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,160
have a 3% loss weight from a bad

290
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,519
management of bound versus Unbound

291
00:10:54,159 --> 00:11:00,319
flower it's directly translates to 3% of

292
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,600
your Topline Revenue disappearing

293
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,720
yeah and um it's and not only does you

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,879
know are we talk are these metrics that

295
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,000
we're really trying to talk about and

296
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,919
buil ey around directly correlate to

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,399
Topline revenue from we perspective it's

298
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,879
actually you know directly correlating

299
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,399
to you know the uh most uh valuable and

300
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:20,480
fragile parts of the plant yeah and

301
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,039
these days I mean quality is so

302
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,720
important for All Brands but especially

303
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,480
the guys the the middle siiz companies

304
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,200
we're not talking about the Giants right

305
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,839
but for the small businesses quality is

306
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,079
everything quality comes down to your

307
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,600
success or your failure in the in the

308
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,838
wreck Market especially y uh otherwise

309
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,040
it's just a race to the bottom if you're

310
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,560
in the middle so I that could that could

311
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,199
be the difference of keeping your your

312
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,479
business alive or your business failing

313
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,600
and then storage now because there's

314
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,600
this abundance of product available uh

315
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,159
your your product might not get consumed

316
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,639
for two or three or four months that's

317
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,719
when you really have to be concerned

318
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,839
with how is it being stored you know

319
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,959
I've been talking I mean you guys were

320
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,240
in my book I featured yeah your bags in

321
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,479
my book also the refrigerated model I

322
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,680
think everything needs to be store it at

323
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,519
a colder temperature from the time it

324
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,479
leaves your facility where you've

325
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,399
obviously tried to store it and keep it

326
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,079
in a controlled environment the time the

327
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,919
consumer gets it you need to control

328
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,439
that product as much as possible people

329
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,799
don't talk hey well I think you're

330
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,320
you're talking about do points and

331
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,240
stressor the flower there yeah um we've

332
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,639
seen that play out a lot and certainly

333
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,720
you know frustrations in different

334
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,959
markets for for example Ontario work

335
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,480
with a you know some really talented

336
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:40,638
folks out there um and the um on and you

337
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,639
product and sit in warehouses very poor

338
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,839
climate conditions for months yeah and

339
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,879
what we're we're talking about there

340
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,079
when you're bringing flour from you know

341
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,799
very cold environments let's say below

342
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,519
below 45 degrees Fahrenheit super warm

343
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,639
environments and I would Define that as

344
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,240
above 70 degrees Fahrenheit what you're

345
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,278
doing is you're really stressing flow

346
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,519
you're dramatically increasing

347
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,320
respiration rate for some of those

348
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,720
volatile organic organic compounds and

349
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,399
you know what's going on there is

350
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,440
actually really negative the same way

351
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,958
burping is really negative because you

352
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,600
then have containers and storage

353
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,159
conditions that don't allow those

354
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,759
volatile organic compounds a chance to

355
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,360
settle and re re reattach and stabilize

356
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,838
flow when you're doing any sort of

357
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
burping or evacuation or flush or you

358
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,639
have leaky packaging or you have

359
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,079
packaging with Bad Barrier Properties or

360
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,159
you know bad oxygen transmission rates

361
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:31,078
or moisture VOR transmission rates that

362
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,519
you know and it's really not lined up

363
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,399
with this particularly with the you know

364
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,360
the water activity level of flour and

365
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,759
it's you know unth thoughtful storage

366
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,399
environments you have dramatic

367
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,159
qualitative you know damage happening at

368
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,559
all of those points and then it kind of

369
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,480
comes together particularly when you're

370
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,078
stressing flower outside of those ranges

371
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,000
you really don't have the same product

372
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,439
that you you submitted anymore and

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,559
that's it's unfortunate it's unfortunate

374
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,199
uh so let's talk about burping and what

375
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,319
goes on with burping and why tur blocks

376
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,639
have such a huge Advantage if you're

377
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,440
using them as opposed to the traditional

378
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,759
burp burping methods MH just finished a

379
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,279
study on that great question yeah um

380
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,800
just finished a study on that which uh

381
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,838
um Lance will touch on a little bit love

382
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,159
it if you gave a little teaser because

383
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,079
we're com coming out with that we're

384
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,679
we're pretty psyched about what we

385
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,399
studied and who we worked with on and I

386
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,399
think you know one of the things we've

387
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,600
always hoped to do as a business is kind

388
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,320
of further the conversation and curing

389
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,120
and storage and post Harvest life cycle

390
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,160
of flower post harest observational flow

391
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,278
uh but the burping versus you know the

392
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:38,919
passive G gas exchange that really comes

393
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,759
down to when you have a an agitation

394
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,319
state of flour you have a tremendous

395
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,320
amount of volatile organic compounds

396
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
that are within the head space of your

397
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,560
container vessel and by doing a a you

398
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,360
know burp which is really a full evacu

399
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,399
evacuation or flushing you're expelling

400
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,959
those volatile organic compounds out out

401
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,679
of out of the package so once you know

402
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,198
that you know when you open up you know

403
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,958
that pack package you know so depending

404
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,278
on some devices they might say well you

405
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,679
know they might be reinforced the

406
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,480
science of well you have a monolayer of

407
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,519
humidity that's kind of protecting the

408
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,320
product and sure but once that product's

409
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,360
add shade and broken you should really

410
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,040
be hit with an overwhelming you know

411
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,039
smell and that's that's the volatile

412
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,439
organic compounds but when you go into

413
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,599
facility and they're you know burping

414
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,399
and purging containers and you know the

415
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,959
the Cure room and the dry room is being

416
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,440
burped and you you smell that that's

417
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,399
that's not what I want to see in in a in

418
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,759
a in a cure cure and Storage room I want

419
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,600
to you know I want to see that a little

420
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,199
bit under controlled setting in your dry

421
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,959
stage but in your cure stage that to me

422
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,639
that's major qualitative loss points

423
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,119
you're opening that toad you're

424
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,519
agitating that flower you're exposing it

425
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,399
to to Raw air you know you're releasing

426
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,759
it ton oh wow that room smells great

427
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,879
that flowers is going be loud that's

428
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,240
that's a qualitative that's a tangible

429
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,720
qualitative loss Point yep yeah and I

430
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,879
think when we talk about burping as

431
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,000
being an art form that is an art form

432
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,759
when you're having to do it by hand and

433
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,839
you're not able to you know and it comes

434
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,079
out different every time so then it does

435
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,959
when you're doing it to that extent it

436
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,278
is an art form right but it doesn't have

437
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:12,159
to be it's it's an art form because it's

438
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:14,439
been a response to the physiological

439
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,159
nature of the plan and our understanding

440
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,519
of how to process it and handle it but

441
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,360
at at this stage in our industry we we

442
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,480
know and have researched and explored

443
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,440
and have quantitative bases that

444
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,959
directly correlate to these these

445
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,800
qualitative metrics right you know and

446
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,078
might say for example what's this guy

447
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,240
talking about well we all have the

448
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,078
classic 90° stem test right where a stem

449
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,480
should bend and then snap at you know

450
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:44,359
cleanly at 90 well that directly

451
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,879
correlates to about five. 5859 water

452
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,000
activity level in my experience and

453
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,519
there is there is a degree of VAR you

454
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,679
can get into V degrees of variation

455
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,959
nuances A variation for cultivation

456
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:58,000
style or cultivar uh and by cultivar I

457
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,518
mean dominant turpine profiles which

458
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,480
very interesting stuff get into a little

459
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,279
bit more but that's a that's a pretty

460
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,959
consistent standard so and then saying

461
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,879
well you know what's what's my bound

462
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,360
versus you know free water in the plant

463
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,120
what's what's really ideal what's the

464
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,958
the defini definitive you know litmus

465
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,918
test point when flowers is done drying

466
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,600
and entering curring well you know I

467
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,038
would say very very clearly you know

468
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,558
James has 0.58 to to 0.59 you know all

469
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,160
all day I would say 62 I would say

470
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:28,480
that's a little too much you you have a

471
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,519
for a little bit more you know Top Line

472
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,200
you know weight the the flower cannot

473
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,599
use that much Unbound water you have a

474
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,480
dramatically higher increase of

475
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,119
microbial you know you could really get

476
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,558
into diving signs there but that that's

477
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,399
that's really where we know we want to

478
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,759
be a flower in terms of both it's

479
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,880
optimized Health State and it's optim

480
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,759
it's optimized you know bound water

481
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,360
content for actually weight at point of

482
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,440
sale nice yeah we focus all that right

483
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,319
for me I'm I'm limited in being outdoor

484
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,558
grower to Mother Nature but for indoor

485
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,279
you know like your operation here the

486
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,798
one we toured earlier you know when

487
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,678
you're God growing as I say and you have

488
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:03,400
control over that ambient that existing

489
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,440
environment we put so much focus on what

490
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,280
is you walk into a veg State and you

491
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,000
feel the higher humidity you feel how

492
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,279
the air is just heavier and then you

493
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,119
feel how it's a bit lighter as we

494
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,038
transition into flower with indor you

495
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,038
know we put so much emphasis on things

496
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,798
like that that ambient RH and then it

497
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,919
seems to get a bit of lot of loss of

498
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,759
focus post Harvest and the things that

499
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,159
we're finding just statistically you

500
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,079
know there's an average of six touch

501
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,760
points between takeown and consumption

502
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,199
so this chain of custody like to your

503
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,400
pointing what Jack was is mentioning

504
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,640
with our friends up in Canada finding

505
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,559
that there's opportunities for a fail on

506
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,240
what should be that top-notch end

507
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:39,558
product because of the fact that you

508
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,960
have a variance in your relative

509
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:43,038
humidity you have a variance in your

510
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,079
ambient temperatures again to his point

511
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,240
not to pick on Canada but Health Canada

512
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,000
did kind of miss the mark on having more

513
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,079
strict regulations around that chain of

514
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,240
custody because something goes to his

515
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,240
point from what might be an ideal

516
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,000
temperature and ideal relative humidity

517
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,400
room or or space for this product it

518
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,839
goes into a truck

519
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,159
that might be out in freezing

520
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,240
temperatures crossing over from you know

521
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,679
wherever Ontario to Quebec and then all

522
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,000
of a sudden that product is brought back

523
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,400
up to a room temperature and you're

524
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,679
really shocking the plant and we try to

525
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,880
educate Growers that you and I talked

526
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,080
about this all the time man growing's

527
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,400
only half the battle any smart grower

528
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,639
and I respect it fullterm weeks on weeks

529
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,038
on weeks on weeks months of of waiting

530
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,080
for this plant to be done but you can

531
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,119
mess it up you can mess it up in the dry

532
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,199
you can mess it up in the cure to Jack's

533
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,798
point you can mess it up in the

534
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,919
processing the packaging and even

535
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:33,679
putting it on the shelf so that's where

536
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,720
we're trying to get people to focus more

537
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,480
because there is a lot going on and a

538
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,679
lot of people don't realize you chop the

539
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,400
plant from its life force it's not dead

540
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,720
that's a crazy thing man the studies and

541
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,798
going back to the study that we're going

542
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,159
to be releasing next week we did it with

543
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:49,918
our friends at CRC Dr Alison Justice

544
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:51,760
who's very focused like us she loves

545
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,080
tping she loves that whole post Harvest

546
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,079
element that's where she focuses the

547
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,038
things that we are finding are

548
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,759
staggering as far as what's going on to

549
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,400
your point in a typical you know

550
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,359
metalizer met pet package a myar package

551
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,240
if you will versus in something like TPL

552
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,719
Block versus something like a glass jar

553
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,558
or a glass jar or um or a Met pet pack

554
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,880
with say a humidity pack like scene

555
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,240
where like certain things that you add

556
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,840
into that environment actually increase

557
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,120
the oxygen which we don't want we don't

558
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,319
want oxid I mean I love CBN but I love

559
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,959
THC over CBN any day you want a little

560
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:24,439
bit of O that's where we kind of get

561
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,679
back to curated curated gases just the

562
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,120
the same as we know now that a lot of us

563
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,400
lot of lot of guys are focusing on in

564
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,519
their in their Gardens um gas measures

565
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
in the rooms you know pump pumping CO2

566
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:39,279
and what not in the room so actually I

567
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,280
deal gas mixtures you know for for the

568
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,599
plant in terms of pro post Harvest

569
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,319
respiratory environment because you

570
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,879
still have residual enzimatic processes

571
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,720
and biologic processes going down even

572
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,080
if the the plant is no longer in its you

573
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,839
know primary feeding stage of its life

574
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,639
right a good example of that is you know

575
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,119
us monitoring and and through this study

576
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,080
you know the plant as much as it takes

577
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,639
in CO2 and puts puts off oxygen which is

578
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,599
why we live all these bushes and trees

579
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,240
and and living things around us where we

580
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,959
survive and and live the same thing is

581
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,159
going on post Harvest where we're seeing

582
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,759
instead of taking in CO2 and putting out

583
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,320
oxygen it's actually putting out CO2

584
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,919
with a minute amount of oxygen and

585
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,439
that's these gases that we're studying

586
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,600
and going how does this affect the

587
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,240
sugars how does this affect affect the

588
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:24,719
turpine profile the canabo profile so

589
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,880
it's really eye openening when you do

590
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,360
start kind of pulling back and putting

591
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,480
as much focus on post Harvest as you do

592
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,839
on on harvest itself right growing

593
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,919
itself so pretty it's just important

594
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:40,879
post harus i' love to yeah yeah yeah

595
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,520
let's Fire Let's fire this up here what

596
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,278
what's the Jame loud podcast without

597
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,400
some loud so this is some I call it dirt

598
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,880
Skittles oh man

599
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,640
this this is some dirt ground Skittles

600
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,880
outdoor for the win yeah so hi from

601
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
humbled seedco was on a podcast a while

602
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,919
back and we did the side by side with

603
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,038
the Coco versus the soil that was the

604
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,960
only variable that we changed it was in

605
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,960
the same room plants were grown very

606
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,360
like rose next to each other and you

607
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,240
know it's these These are the Smalls

608
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,839
that's well I like not uncomon I don't

609
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,359
small either there's still quality there

610
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,240
it grind the same you know so they don't

611
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,240
drip as hard as maybe the the bigger

612
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,319
buds but as far as flavor I really enjoy

613
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,558
the flavor from it um it has good Ash

614
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,558
has not that that's like necessar a

615
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,759
quality indicator lot of emphasis on the

616
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,440
ash I'm with you hypothetically speaking

617
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,038
some of the stuff I've seen in Japan in

618
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,840
terms of the living living soil Gardens

619
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,000
yeah yeah is like just the most

620
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,720
unbelievable turb profiles for like very

621
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,519
unique Nuance turbs i' I've never seen

622
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,278
yeah yeah Rock Wall Coco nothing against

623
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,440
these

624
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:53,558
other yeah yeah Japan does special

625
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,080
things with fruits and vegetables and

626
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm sure they can apply that to their

627
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,918
knowledge with cannabis we really praise

628
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,038
and you know kind of the Dutch

629
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,159
agricultural tradition you know as as

630
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:08,558
you know farmers and Growers especially

631
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:11,159
out here in the US you know um I we do

632
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:13,558
not talk enough about um Korean and

633
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,080
Japanese styen of farming and soil

634
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,720
practices yeah you know I you know I I

635
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,759
know some of the best best Growers I

636
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,960
know in the United States I'm talking

637
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,919
very you know small few rooms one room

638
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,558
couple rooms you know stuff's always

639
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,880
sold out to to one guy and no question

640
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,278
like if you don't know anybody good luck

641
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,000
you'll never see the flower type of

642
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,519
stuff we all know this folks right um

643
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
the the guy considers just his dirt the

644
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,038
most valuable valuable thing he has has

645
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,798
been working on that dirt and that dirt

646
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:46,599
profile for 20 years it all starts man

647
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,440
yeah yeah and I think as a craft product

648
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,399
I do enjoy soil there's nothing wrong

649
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,480
with Coco I use coco in my facility

650
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,159
right yeah yeah we use Rock Woolf for

651
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
moms and we use for the plugs we use

652
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,120
rock wool as what stonewool stonewool is

653
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,240
what they're calling it now sorry guys

654
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:02,239
Stone

655
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,120
ambiguous term many many cup winers do

656
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,159
do the same thing yeah yeah yeah and I

657
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,199
think we we well we have a sterile

658
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,200
facility or as sterile as possible we

659
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,519
basically have a closed circuit system

660
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,720
here we're not bringing in new things

661
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,599
that could introduce pests or uh any

662
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,759
sort of viruses so you know it's like we

663
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,678
do everything from tissue culture our

664
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,879
seeds that we pop even we we test those

665
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,960
to make sure we don't have viruses and

666
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:32,760
viroids uh but as far as smoking best of

667
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,880
the best I do enjoy soil so you know and

668
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,839
there's nothing wrong with rock wool or

669
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,360
coco I think they're both great

670
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,918
substrates and they both have their

671
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,839
purpose um they're are masters of every

672
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,080
medium I mean I've seen oh yeah I've

673
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,199
been smoking a lot of rockwool weed

674
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,398
believe it or not and then I wasn't even

675
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,360

company yes um which matters yeah for me

682
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,319

doing things you know a lot of people

716
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,600
like [ __ ] off well the reason Hard Sell

717
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,320
right the reason we have such well the

718
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,519
reason our sale is so consultative be

719
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,639
like I want you to try it you know I

720
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,879
respect what you do I've smoked your

721
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,120
gear I bought your gear like you know

722
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,278
I'm going to give you some bags this is

723
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,839
how I want you to try them out this is

724
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:43,558
how I want you to use it this is It's

725
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,678
kind of the SOP this is the philosophy

726
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:49,639
behind the the SOP right um have have to

727
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,360
be consultative you have to get people

728
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,720
able to try it well it's A Hard Sell

729
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,678
because there's so much snake oil and

730
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,480
there's so many people saying I have the

731
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,759
best product and it's not the best

732
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,000
product yeah you know and you guys

733
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,119
actually do have have the best product

734
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,759
that I've seen for for curing for

735
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,839
long-term storage I think you guys are a

736
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,119
great solution I tested you know I was

737
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,278
working with JJ and we tested the the

738
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:13,239
actual seed storage and I think that's a

739
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:15,839
game changer we we've got some exciting

740
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,558
work we've made on that they um R&amp;D

741
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,398
team's doing a lot of a lot of cool

742
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,918
stuff yeah right right now um but it's

743
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,158
it's an exciting time I mean with with

744
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,360
groups like CRC really pushing forward I

745
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,840
mean even even some of the stuff that

746
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,479
you know our colleagues industry you

747
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,480
know I I will say you know um canr is

748
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,240
doing a focusing on a lot of the right

749
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,120
stuff in terms of free water and bound

750
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,960
water yeah and kind of their their

751
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,879
philosophies they're really you know I'm

752
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm really impressed with you know some

753
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,399
of our colleagues in in the space in

754
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,640
general just even you know in in that

755
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:54,359
are trying to service this category in

756
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,278
terms of how how much deeper the the

757
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,639
knowledge Bas is is how much more

758
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,919
scientific and you know want the the you

759
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,919
know be best best product to to win yeah

760
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,519
you know well you know hopefully we we

761
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,278
out innovate ourselves versus someone

762
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,919
out out innovating us we we try to do

763
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,759
that but it's it's a very exciting time

764
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,720
in terms of you know we're we're

765
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,480
learning more about the true physiology

766
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,480
of the plant and we're going to learn

767
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,839
more in the next year than we have

768
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,519
collectively learned as industry over

769
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,678
the last 20 I know it's so wild and I

770
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:27,440
mean just learning about the plant for

771
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,720
for me from a cultivation standpoint

772
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,000
with different cultivars in different

773
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,759
places like St Vincent and the

774
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,599
Grenadines where I've been yep and uh

775
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,759
Washington State and growing outdoors

776
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,558
and comparing the two you know it's it's

777
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,038
a beautiful thing when you can start

778
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:43,000
comparing and contrasting using

779
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,398
different climates for the same genetics

780
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,798
and being able to compare and I mean

781
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,079
they've been doing it AEG forever and

782
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,519
now we're able to do it really focused

783
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,558
in cannabis we have the software we have

784
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,079
the the manow and and like the amount of

785
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,678
learning that we're able to do in such a

786
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,240
short period of time compared to what's

787
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,240
beenen happening before pretty amazing I

788
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,159
was with the you gentleman today and

789
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,519
we're we're going through his his

790
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,919
facility and we've got you know looking

791
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:12,200
at five years of hard true data across

792
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,840
every variable for the life cycle of all

793
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,960
the flower that amazing came through the

794
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:20,678
facility it's you know I I'm talking you

795
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,960
know temperature chain of custody I'm

796
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,519
talking you know um moisture content not

797
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,960
water activity but moisture you know

798
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,000
still doing a lot of moisture content

799
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,200
chain of custody gas gas mixtures in the

800
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,319
room um life cycles all all

801
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,319
variabilities like it's it's really it's

802
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,398
it's fascinating in terms of and this

803
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,359
was in Oakland this Oakland he's cre

804
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,278
Sops and you I think you know I think he

805
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,278
told me to tell you hi so I'll share who

806
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:49,919
it is off fine but but he's creating

807
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:53,240
Sops not just for the operation and its

808
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,519
totality but he's creating Sops that are

809
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,359
cultivar specific which is pretty epic

810
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,200
so talking to this gentleman who comes

811
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,959
from the techn techology space which I

812
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,080
respect that was my other life you know

813
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,480
he is looking at it from such an

814
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,678
objective perspective and he's stepping

815
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,278
back and going okay I need to make this

816
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,240
the most efficient it can be and so

817
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,278
thing Jack and I were talking about you

818
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,000
know I I'm like you I'm more of a land

819
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,599
race guy I respect the new stuff which

820
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,880
jack is all into but he's like these are

821
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:22,119
the cultiv ours at work these are the

822
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,799
Sops I have and he puts them in rotation

823
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,038
he knows what he's growing a year and a

824
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:27,720
half out from now which is insane that's

825
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:28,798
how scheduled and how regimen I think

826
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,880
know

827
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:36,000
yes you know who this is yeah I mean

828
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,000
talk to him like this like next level

829
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,839
he's getting into light spectrums we're

830
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,839
we're we're J in light pigments we're

831
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,319
kind of kind of jumping all over and

832
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,519
yeah I mean that's that's you know

833
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:48,359
that's a Obsession but what what Lance

834
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,359
is building on there and I think this is

835
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,558
a great philosophy to have in a facility

836
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,558
is you know

837
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,278
removing removing opportunities for

838
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,119
variabilities um

839
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:02,480
removing opportunities for error

840
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:06,319
removing opportunities for mistakes just

841
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,759
kind of the SOP workflow processes you

842
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,759
know it's it's you know this was so much

843
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,158
more of a you know um Automotive

844
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,240
production facility than a yeah it

845
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,639
really was widgets that's why I was

846
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,880
referencing he's looking at as a widget

847
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:21,119
which is not a bad thing like sometimes

848
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,559
I think those of us who are emotionally

849
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,359
attached to this plant and compassionate

850
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:27,440
for it like we do kind of Miss stepping

851
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:29,278
back and going let's look at different

852
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,038
objectively it's like a real estate

853
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,038
developer that falls in love with the

854
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,599
building and gets totally underwater on

855
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,798
the building and you know and and let's

856
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:40,558
then chases the building down you it's

857
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:43,000
the same same same type of of concept

858
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,440
you know I think you have to have vision

859
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,480
and romance to be a builder of anything

860
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,759
real real estate too but also need to

861
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,599
Tamper that and be like I'm I'm in love

862
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,720
with this building but I'm I'm the world

863
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,000
is not in love with this building

864
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,038
that'll let it go same way same way you

865
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,519
know chasing a strain or new skew or a

866
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:59,558
new product or

867
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,798
for

868
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:04,558
me I believe you have to be devoted to

869
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,158
the product for me it's like a

870
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,278
devotional thing but I have a I have a

871
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,320
business partner who's my balance which

872
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,000
is great and we have a whole team of

873
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,879
people that you know I can start chasing

874
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,079
stuff down rabbit holes real quick and

875
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,200
sometimes it's like you got to stay

876
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,638
balanced right and so well you do it's

877
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,558
it's and it's not a yin and yang but

878
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,879
your partner you guys are very well

879
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:25,480
balanced and it is interesting because

880
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,880
you respect what he brings to the table

881
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,440
he respects what you bring to the table

882
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,039
but you're right you need that just in

883
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,320
general and and that's one thing that

884
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:34,240
came up again in this conversation was

885
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,720
um I don't know if you've toured any of

886
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,960
the family grows in Hawaii but that's

887
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,558
what I talked about was how you know

888
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,679
those people pass on the genetics from

889
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,839
generation to generation they keep

890
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,240
growing the same plant they're not

891
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,599
chasing the latest candies or dessert

892
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,519
cultivars and that's the interesting

893
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:50,519
thing too with this individual is he's

894
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,079
doing a rinse and repeat but the thing

895
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,558
is he's got the client he he pre-cells

896
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,759
that's something you mentioned I I know

897
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,158
very few guys that pre-sell very the the

898
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,638
cottage sub Acer guy okay but the guys

899
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,679
that are scaled not so much and this guy

900
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:04,678
pre- sells a majority of his flower

901
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,399
because they know what they're going to

902
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,639
get the best guys all do I would say the

903
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:12,079
best guys all see it with guys that are

904
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:14,759
above a th000 pounds a there's not a lot

905
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,158
of guys at scale that are like yeah

906
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,919
thousand pounds a month surprised me

907
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,039
with this bigger than a large homes

908
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,519
basement footprint no yeah yeah yeah

909
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,158
there's only a handful of guys doing

910
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,880
yeah yeah but it is impressive because

911
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,559
he's proving that you know not to get

912
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,880
into a bigger infil philosophical and

913
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,359
it's a whole tangent but it makes you

914
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,039
step back like we visit our friends up

915
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,678
at cbcb and Berkeley you know shout out

916
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:37,158
to Jimmy and the crew and you know I was

917
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,480
asking them like what's hot what's not

918
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,600
what's moving what's not and seeing some

919
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,558
of the class like saw Northern Lights I

920
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:45,000
was surprised to see an L NL I was

921
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,158
surprised to see a um what was the other

922
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,038
one was a Derman poison which I question

923
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,278
it's Purity but I'm like does that sell

924
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:54,599
compared

925
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:56,319
to I mean for us like we're we you know

926
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,798
we live world peace through turps like

927
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,038
we we like our team is like we you know

928
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,480
Julian's you know been to Durban you

929
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,398
know and like so we yeah I know real

930
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,240
Duran yeah yeah but it's you know me and

931
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,078
I have not seen a lot of real Durban in

932
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,559
the market n um I love Durban and it was

933
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:15,280
part of like foundational for the group

934
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,599
that I work with we had Durban Poison it

935
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,040
was one of the things along with Sour

936
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,760
Diesel and a bunch of things back in the

937
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:22,320
day really distinct Shing profil very

938
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,639
distinct and the thing is is if I

939
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,200
smelled real Durban right now I'd be

940
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,960
like that's it but a lot of this hazy

941
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,319
stuff is not the real Durban that I had

942
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,960
uh it leans towards this this hazy side

943
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,639
and there's nothing wrong with that no

944
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,320
but it's not the Durban that I remember

945
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,079
that was really you know it was really

946
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,639
big and it had bright orange hairs it

947
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,519
was it was almost like yarn growing we

948
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,760
remember as kids it really was for me as

949
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:44,679
a consumer as an Enthusiast or ahead you

950
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,760
know like I got to tell you James I

951
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,358
don't even know how much I care that

952
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,960
it's like not that authentic of durman

953
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:52,480
because it's getting it's

954
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,639
getting more people and more consumers

955
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,960
and granted we're talking about a

956
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,920
smoker's dispensary right like you know

957
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,240
there there's casual dispensers and

958
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,280
there's dispensors for the Dr public

959
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,159
there's smoker dispensers absolutely but

960
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,599
you know we're talking about a prodct

961
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,480
here if you're getting people interested

962
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,480
in land races and genetic profiles and

963
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,199
turine profiles that's a good thing that

964
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,559
it is an amazing thing and it's a great

965
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,879
thing you know I think diversity

966
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,000
especially pushing the agenda for

967
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,960
diversity within the plant we keep

968
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,880
bottlenecking ourselves Europe did it

969
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,960
with Haze a long time ago we did it with

970
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,960
gelato from from cookies to gelato to

971
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,920
this candy I'm enjoying this y I'm

972
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,880
enjoying this side it's got like a nice

973
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,720
nice nice soci energy kind of clean Z

974
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,680
proper FL proper cure I'm golden yeah so

975
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:39,799
I think pushing the agenda on getting

976
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,159
people reintroduced to L race and that's

977
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,640
a lot of the stuff I'm doing is taking

978
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:44,440
old genetics and mixing them with the

979
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,920
new stuff and trying to reintroduce him

980
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,119
that way that's I always liked about you

981
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,960
because you do very few guys do I I like

982
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,720
sharing that experience with people and

983
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,159
I feel like we had Dave from budalo on

984
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:59,000
our podcast and he's really pushing the

985
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:02,358
long flowering variety agenda and trying

986
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,280
to like Cuban pffs that are like running

987
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:07,358
like late 70s 80 days more he's got some

988
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,040
pearls you know like I mean those things

989
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,159
are amazing and I think they need to be

990
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,279
shared with people because it's about an

991
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:14,480
experience and if you can get people to

992
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,720
try those things in the right

993
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,079
environment and they get the same

994
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,480
experience that you do they'll fall in

995
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,240
love with it it has to be curated

996
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,639
there's also there's a there's a you

997
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,799
know there's a viability to it too you

998
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,519
know that's kind of one of the cruel

999
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,640
sides of the market is absolutely you

1000
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,920
know people people have to you know you

1001
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,279
got to grow to pay bills you got to grow

1002
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,400
grow for yields if you're growing for

1003
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,680
res you got not everybody can grow a

1004
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,318
16we variety and be successful most

1005
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,919
people can't right but there is a niche

1006
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:40,639
market for the people that do most

1007
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,838
people aren't aren't don't have any

1008
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,759
business that's that's built for it no

1009
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:46,679
no no and you really need to have a

1010
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,839
facility that's geared towards growing

1011
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,199
those type of genetics and you need to

1012
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,199
have a a model that can sustain you know

1013
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:54,159
a production cycle like that not even at

1014
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,960
that even as a home I think I told you

1015
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,078
this I got um some first round from Cal

1016
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,119
C code

1017
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,599
you a friend just asked if could first

1018
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,760
it was a zoss with Tai it was a very

1019
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,760
land heavy and that thing was the

1020
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,280
longest term I ever so even as a homeg

1021
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,280
grower to your point like wanting it as

1022
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,720
medicine or just being cognizant of the

1023
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,640
season and the bandwidth you have and

1024
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,519
your spare time those are pain in the

1025
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,559
ass man to run it a month or two longer

1026
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:19,920
than I'm accustomed to as a grower you

1027
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,239
know the end product was phenomenal

1028
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,519
don't get me wrong but it was like geez

1029
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,078
man like it's too much I'm going to grow

1030
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:29,119
some soil uh Sour Diesel next year

1031
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,200
Outdoors that's my goal is to grow the

1032
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,800
real Sour Diesel cut next year outdoor

1033
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,318
just for personal because I love it so

1034
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
much you have the seed because that's

1035
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,039
when I do have true seeds from oh no

1036
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,679
there's no TR there will you will not

1037
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,358
find Sour Diesel real Sour Diesel in my

1038
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:44,639
opinion in seed I I've been searching

1039
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,759
finally at reggae I met Dave and he's

1040
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,480
got the real cut yeah and so that is the

1041
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,079
only real Sour Diesel I remember one

1042
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,920
Sour Diesel we can argue about all these

1043
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,359
different sour diesels oh my God what I

1044
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,920
remember as Sour Diesel is what Dave has

1045
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,480
and in my opinion there might be other

1046
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,960
sour

1047
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,599
derives most excited from just a

1048
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,159
consumer head you know perspective like

1049
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,920
about what he's working on because to me

1050
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:14,440
that's the most authentic like the you

1051
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,358
know like the kind of like like the

1052
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,318
throat kind of the I remember the res

1053
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:20,639
and the smoke it had a very distinct tur

1054
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:22,559
like really like like kind of Co coughed

1055
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,000
your throat almost like kind of like

1056
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,119
Wretch like it's you kind of you had a

1057
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,960
film on your throat you know you like

1058
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,640
you you you know exactly what I'm about

1059
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,760
well it had to be harvested correctly it

1060
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:33,199
had to be dried and cured and stored

1061
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,480
correctly otherwise it wouldn't have

1062
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,480
that expression that you were looking

1063
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:42,519
for yeah but it had it had a punch to it

1064
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,280
a thickness or a not like a not a creamy

1065
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:47,119
smoothness but a cream like they could

1066
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,400
play with like milk to the to the

1067
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,318
Smoke yeah it was like just like a great

1068
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,599
batch was just in intense resin like

1069
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:57,719
resin like that on Most flowers you not

1070
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,240
want to smoke you'd be like oh you is

1071
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:03,598
better for washing but it it yeah I i'

1072
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,959
um there's a reason so many people are

1073
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,920
are chasing it and I think there's

1074
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,639
reason so many people are excited that

1075
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,000
are you know that are you know that and

1076
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,318
there's a lot of people that think

1077
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,639
they've seen it because they've seen a

1078
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:14,679
derivative but they've never seen the

1079
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,480
real deal just like ciss ciss is another

1080
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:20,480
one it's like those things in their

1081
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,679
optimal environment cured dried

1082
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,119
correctly grown correctly checking all

1083
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,440
those boxes along the way all those

1084
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,000
touch points and you get this amazing

1085
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,119
thing but that's the beauty of cannabis

1086
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,800
is like you could have it and it's very

1087
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,599
difficult to grow and difficult to

1088
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,359
execute properly and each time is

1089
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:38,519
slightly different on a craft level well

1090
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:41,519
I mean it's it's a qualitative

1091
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:44,400
expression of a you know of a of a of

1092
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:47,039
crop right of a plant you know that's

1093
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,480
that's that's the fun that's the joy

1094
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,440
that's the that's the passion to it

1095
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,639
right I think if you talk like you know

1096
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,119
the the heads of the cigar space right

1097
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,639
like you talk like you know old man

1098
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,519
padron the padron you know cigar compan

1099
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:02,639
is a lot of tobacco vertically

1100
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,400
integrated tobacco company from you know

1101
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,879
from genetics you know from Cuban seed

1102
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,680
that they took when they were refugees

1103
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,400
from from Cuba um to you know their

1104
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,960
their harvesting and you know it's a

1105
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,519
fermented product right it's big big

1106
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,079
difference there cannabis is not not

1107
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:21,358
fermented in terms we're talking about

1108
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:23,720
the Aging right but um kind of you know

1109
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,400
the admitting the the natural

1110
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,000
variability to it being the element to

1111
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,639
it you you that that is the the thrill

1112
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,239
of like the great you know great bag or

1113
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,799
like popping you know that seed like you

1114
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,439
know for for people that truly in the

1115
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,240
know that can appreciate that like

1116
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,240
inexplicably like you know this this

1117
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,598
batch of cigars like these these cigars

1118
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,358
in this corner of this box they these

1119
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,440
were the hitters out of it but that's

1120
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,759
where they're similar right because

1121
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,240
you're you're we're talking you know the

1122
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,880
genetics but genino and feno are a

1123
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:52,279
factor and you talked about the side by

1124
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,318
side with soil right and that's John

1125
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,319
from raay Cannabis good buddy of mine up

1126
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,400
out of soam you know he'd surprise me

1127
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,719
every year and he'd bring down I

1128
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,400
remember one year when wedding cake was

1129
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,679
popping off he didn't tell me he brought

1130
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,720
in all his he always would bring in a

1131
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,118
dozen jars to Emerald cup and just SL

1132
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,559
through the side door and he put three

1133
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,318
jars in front of me and he's like which

1134
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:10,759
one of these three are your favorite and

1135
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:12,039
I picked the one which was my favorite

1136
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,640
I'm like but they they all have a

1137
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:16,239
similar profile and he's like these are

1138
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:18,598
all wedding cake he's all wedding cake

1139
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,719
indoor wedding cake like dep wedding

1140
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,680
cake outdoor you chose the outdoor it

1141
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:26,159
was insane how different these three

1142
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,480
plants looked at the end of that just

1143
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,480
based on how they and all all soil

1144
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,240
that's the crazy part it was all soil it

1145
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,318
was just it's environmental they're

1146
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,519
going through very different light

1147
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:37,318
spectrums right light spectrums and

1148
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,880
again you know the appalaches of the I

1149
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,400
mean he was 45 minutes Issa Acer so he

1150
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,960
doesn't even get much of the fog bank

1151
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,480
it's a whole different world there

1152
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,838
versus The Rock or versus Fort Bragg you

1153
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,440
know it's insane but that does make an

1154
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,000
impact and that's where a lot of the

1155
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,720
argument was around respecting the

1156
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,239
Appalachia like what makes it a true

1157
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:59,519
Appalachia can you replicate that sun

1158
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,199
Spectrum indoor and take that soil Indo

1159
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,880
and create all the other the fog bank

1160
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,598
and all these other factors and it was

1161
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,599
decided no you can't it literally it has

1162
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,400
to be within these quadrants and it has

1163
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,160
to be grown here in order to be

1164
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,800
champagne because if it's outside the

1165
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,318
Champagne region it's called sparkling

1166
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,519
wine for sure a marketing thing too

1167
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,800
right I mean there's pros that that hit

1168
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:20,480
and everything else but it's or you know

1169
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,440
the same thing in you know scotch versus

1170
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,119
whiskey you know you kind of really

1171
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,318
start to get into it and then like well

1172
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,559
you know in cannabis you know you talk

1173
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,480
about with you know we were talking

1174
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,319
about some of the the hats you got there

1175
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,318
and some of the rods and whatnot you

1176
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,519
talk about single Mall versus you know

1177
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,880
versus blended right yeah yeah and then

1178
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:39,358
if you talk about single malt some

1179
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,400
people would say well you you got a

1180
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,558
limited number of flavor profiles in

1181
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,079
single malt which is why we blend have

1182
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,119
you know the richness of the phone well

1183
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,318
that's that's why hash makers blend

1184
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,920
right that's an I'm I'm curious I know

1185
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm not the

1186
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,880
interviewer now weting deep now he's

1187
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,838
lighting the second one up that's one

1188
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,160
thing is interesting I'm curious and not

1189
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:01,759
to it James I I always do this to you

1190
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,159
man but I'm curious of your thought

1191
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,240
because as much as we've done you know

1192
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,759
jessis have done a great job of blending

1193
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,399
up and taking the best of the haze and

1194
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,480
the best of the gas and the best of the

1195
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,639
sour all these things but one thing I'm

1196
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,639
starting to come across a little bit

1197
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:17,480
more is people blending which this is

1198
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:19,960
very similar to Wine sure where they're

1199
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,440
taking a SAS Mero out of Australia and

1200
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,760
making but I'm starting to see people do

1201
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,480
that with blending Cult of ours post

1202
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,119
Harvest it's so funny uh we talked about

1203
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,639
this on my last podcast a little bit

1204
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,358
about hash and I think

1205
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:32,400
the has is going to be blending know

1206
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:34,000
whether it's rosin or whatever it's here

1207
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,519
it's here already but I see it just

1208
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,199
growing and growing and growing I mean I

1209
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,159
think it's very easy to do and if you

1210
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,480
have somebody who's who loves the plant

1211
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,039
who enjoys that process they can come up

1212
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,000
with some wild combinations that you

1213
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:47,880
couldn't get from breeding I mean you

1214
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,199
can get an interesting look at breeding

1215
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,599
if you combine two things and you like

1216
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,399
smoke them you're like well maybe this

1217
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,960
is what I get it never pencils out quite

1218
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,680
like that but it's an interesting way to

1219
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,880
do it and I feel like they do it with

1220
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:04,239
wine do it with so many things whis whis

1221
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,000
wh I I love that like you know I I got

1222
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,759
to sit in on a a Helios uh those guys

1223
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,639
are out of main do a killer job you know

1224
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,319
a lot of us know who that who they are

1225
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:15,759
um know shout out to homie Mike but but

1226
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,759
got the and kind of just kind of

1227
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,040
blending and tasting testing but you can

1228
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,079
use you know polar opposite tping Tesco

1229
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:24,000
turpine profiles I mean you you you

1230
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,440
can't do that with one one you can't

1231
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,358
produce a spectrum of of tpin you know

1232
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,760
flavors oids whatever you want to go uh

1233
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,440
in one plant you know they because

1234
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,880
certain turine profiles can cannot exist

1235
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,119
in harmony with them one one plant right

1236
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,280
that's why I want to find out you know a

1237
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,280
good ex I think I brought this up with

1238
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
you because I don't think you have it in

1239
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,119
your collection but Julie from sweet

1240
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,960
grass out in Colorado she always ran

1241
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,119
sweno and sweno is a literal Cross of

1242
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,240
sourd and blue dream the two most

1243
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,920
selling strains of the 2000s period

1244
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,199
because we had all the access to that

1245
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,440
information at weed maps and that's what

1246
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,759
I'm curious I want to run both of those

1247
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,599
and then consume it and see what the

1248
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,640
similarities are to sweno cuz sweno was

1249
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,559
a very unique where like if you wanted

1250
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:07,480
to lock and watch Netflix you could but

1251
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:08,839
if you wanted to bust out the vacuum

1252
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,280
it's kind of weird you're cool with that

1253
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:12,400
too like it was this really unique

1254
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,440
balance of these two extreme worlds that

1255
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,920
always were segregated for all those

1256
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,039
years you know so that's why I was just

1257
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,800
curious in asking you man because I

1258
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,000
think Blends are the future so I got a

1259
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,920
question for you you tasted this how

1260
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,440
many months ago was this harvested

1261
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,200
before eating you got to try

1262
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,880
so we're going to do a little test here

1263
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:36,399
I know know you're more of a more if you

1264
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,680
guys were to guess on the age of that

1265
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,318
product what would you

1266
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:42,318
say this is me

1267
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:46,199
one was one of my favorite

1268
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:52,318
questions I'm gonna go all in several

1269
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,480
months several months what is several

1270
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,480
months that that is some seriously aged

1271
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,880
flower in my opinion it does not tastes

1272
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,000
fresh to me it tastes like it's

1273
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,960
definitely been cured in in age not just

1274
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,239
cured so I would say take

1275
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,639
down that was last season I mean for

1276
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:11,000
sure that was last season it's super

1277
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:12,719
smooth though man and I and that's where

1278
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,719
I argue and the Italians taught me and I

1279
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,480
totally believe it and we did a study

1280
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:17,879
out of with a lab in La pooke I could

1281
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,960
believe that's six to eight months old

1282
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,318
and was

1283
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,880
was the smoothness of it and the way

1284
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:27,079
it's burning the flower is so stabilized

1285
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,440
the I think that's one thing you can

1286
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:33,920
take from the tobacco industry so this

1287
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:37,760
is some chop Cherry I put this in a turp

1288
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,960
blog 10 months ago yeah oh wow I've been

1289
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,240
saving this for Lance to come on the

1290
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,559
show is so smooth man and uh 10 months

1291
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:48,118
in the tur Block in a 60° room right so

1292
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:49,800
like you kept it in perfect conditions I

1293
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,800
mean yeah you know what you're doing

1294
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,920
with drying it but like that's like it's

1295
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,559
it's so smooth yeah and it's it checks

1296
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,960
the boxes right as far as joint we got a

1297
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:04,359
beautiful Ash forming we've got a we got

1298
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,599
a nice ring forming it's smooth but uh

1299
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:07,759
but the secret is the the tur block you

1300
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,880
and I have talked about this James like

1301
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,520
seriously and it I think it was a year

1302
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,480
before we did the Epic interview that

1303
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:16,759
that never ended up coming into fruition

1304
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,318
out in Barcelona but I met these

1305
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,200
Italians sorry guys if I'm repeating the

1306
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:22,039
story but met these Italians and they

1307
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:23,719
started going on to me about not just

1308
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,838
curing but aging the butt I'm like where

1309
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,358
you they're like it's just like wine

1310
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,920
with the Turpin and maturing I in my

1311
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,838
opinion you're a phenomenal grower and I

1312
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:34,358
already hype you to to everyone I know

1313
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:36,639
CU I love your flower but that is so

1314
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:38,239
smooth dude like there's no Ting there's

1315
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,078
and I mean you flushed it well I'm sure

1316
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,439
you cured it well but that is extremely

1317
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,480
smooth and that's why I age my stuff and

1318
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,599
I have stuff that's two years old and

1319
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,119
people like what the [ __ ] do you turn

1320
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,519
into because I do love everyone knows

1321
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:51,440
I'm an Edibles guy but no a lot of that

1322
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,119
stuff I save it to smoke because it

1323
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,920
changes I mean I like fresh flour too

1324
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,599
don't get me wrong but I feel like

1325
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,039
there's there's some I love testing

1326
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:00,559
stuff too so I'm like well how long can

1327
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:02,800
we keep this and does it still taste

1328
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,440
good you know are the turps still there

1329
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,000
you know I smoked some 5-year-old stuff

1330
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,400
out of my freezer the other day it was

1331
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,960
it was okay it wasn't the best but it

1332
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,680
wasn't completely bad it was better than

1333
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,440
what most people smoke it's better than

1334
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:14,799
the dime bags we getting as kids right

1335
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,240
yeah it's better than the the average

1336
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,720
stuff that you buy at the dispenser even

1337
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:23,279
like it still had enough TPS so how are

1338
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,279
you bringing it back to temperature so

1339
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,480
defitely talking about D points so

1340
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:28,838
before we go too far one of the things

1341
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,838
we're talking about in terms of curing

1342
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:33,480
wine again Gus is not a faned product

1343
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:35,279
but in terms of curing wine wine cures

1344
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,280
differently in different bottle sizes it

1345
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,240
does totally because it has different

1346
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,119
interior interior D points right same

1347
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,759
thing with cannabis right you know

1348
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,240
people like well I'd rather rather have

1349
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,680
a batch you know I'd rather have you

1350
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:50,519
know this great year this great vintage

1351
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:53,960
yeah you know the the James loud you

1352
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:55,960
know you know Cherry from early 2024 you

1353
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,720
get a j botm size volume so it's

1354
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,119
actually whole you know optimal bad

1355
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,318
sizes for the curing and storage of

1356
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,798
cannabis yeah I agree and I mean I have

1357
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:07,719
my own very rustic way of doing it it's

1358
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:10,280
a nice way to put it but I do a sandwich

1359
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:11,879
bag with an ounce and I wrap that in the

1360
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,400
sandwich bag then I vacuum seal it

1361
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,960
Loosely I label it and I put it in the

1362
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,119
freezer I've been doing this for a long

1363
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,519
time so we definitely got to get you our

1364
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,880
saac like you will love it man if if

1365
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:22,280
you're get saac for sure yeah but you

1366
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,798
know I wanted to surprise you guys with

1367
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,200
something since you guys surprised me

1368
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:26,920
with something I I didn't know you guys

1369
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,118
were bringing new bags I'm glad you did

1370
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,720
that's really cool well the official

1371
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:31,240
launch for your well this will be

1372
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:34,118
perfect timing but the official launch

1373
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,798
will be at tpami we're going to excit

1374
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,559
yeah tpami will be there together I'm

1375
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:39,798
not sure if this will air before tpami

1376
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,880
or not if not you guys is a great event

1377
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:44,920
in fact it it will yeah dude TP well I

1378
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,400
mean the on a tangent really quick with

1379
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,798
turami I mean the amount you obviously

1380
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,599
man some great friends but the genetics

1381
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:52,440
like this is something that you know and

1382
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,039
I'm going to go a little bit of a

1383
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,200
parallel and love Tim and Taylor all the

1384
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,639
but the emerald cup that I remember and

1385
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,000
that I love and the reason why it was

1386
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,199
such a pivotal part for me was because

1387
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,719
I'd get to go up there and taste the

1388
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,439
latest flavors off the hill and

1389
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,000
depending on what flavors I liked or

1390
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,760
what flavors w we would go queue up at

1391
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,239
those booths and purchase those seeds

1392
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,839
and that's kind of gone away and so the

1393
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,679
cool thing of tpami is bringing it back

1394
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:19,400
and inviting dozens of geneticists James

1395
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:21,078
loud Ridgeline humbled Etc you know

1396
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,119
having these guys come out bring their

1397
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,079
best seed to the table but then have a

1398
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,200
thousand Growers show up that want this

1399
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,760
limited edition stuff too oh scared

1400
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,558
people with the amount of cultivars we

1401
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,480
brought out you we got this big feno

1402
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,000
hunt that that's ongoing so we're

1403
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,480
constantly pheno hunting new stuff and

1404
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,318
and then also testing it again and

1405
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,639
testing it again y we we go through

1406
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:44,920
redundancies and also multiple rounds of

1407
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,199
testing uh with everything that we do to

1408
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,559
make sure that we're providing people

1409
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:49,598
with the best thing we don't just settle

1410
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:51,680
on one thing right away because as the

1411
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,838
plant grows it changes and as you take

1412
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:56,039
different clonal Generations it changes

1413
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:58,599
yep uh there's the sexual maturity that

1414
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:01,480
goes on within the the plant from the

1415
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:03,559
initial seed run to the second or third

1416
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,159
clonal generation where it starts to

1417
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:08,319
stabilize a little bit more interesting

1418
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,480
so yeah lots of fun yeah I mean I think

1419
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,519
that's you know fun made old adage you

1420
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,480
know moms get tired that's why tissue

1421
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:16,079
culture such an interesting thing so

1422
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,798
many people that's why we got a lab that

1423
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,400
does tissue culture right there it's

1424
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:22,960
pretty sick it's it's super important I

1425
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,798
think tissue culture for banking typical

1426
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,119
you know I think most companies don't

1427
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:28,880
have tissue culture right now but I

1428
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:31,079
think we're moving towards having tissue

1429
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,240
culture in most facilities like large

1430
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,640
facilities it's necessary you have to

1431
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:37,639
bring house we're we're becoming more

1432
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:39,078
aware of viruses and viroids and the

1433
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:41,239
impact that they're bringing into the

1434
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:43,599
industry as a whole like as a percentage

1435
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:45,039
even yeah I think having clean genetics

1436
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,760
is super important especially if you

1437
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,079
have a nursery being able to say that

1438
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,960
you have clean genetics and that you're

1439
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,039
selling clean genetics that's super

1440
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,199
important whether it's seed or whether

1441
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:56,838
it's clone it's so difficult though it's

1442
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:58,719
it's fluid you know you're talking about

1443
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:01,599
you know you're talking about you know

1444
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,399
kite dancing and you know a storm right

1445
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,400
yeah I mean that that's it's you know

1446
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,200
it's undeniably the future it's it's

1447
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,680
just it's difficult right but it's it's

1448
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:10,239
all how mature how all mature

1449
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:12,719
agricultural Industries operate for the

1450
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,239
most part right not for the most part in

1451
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,879
tality yeah exactly but the Clone game

1452
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:18,639
that that goes back into your point and

1453
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,559
you see it over in Europe because you're

1454
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,558
out there dang near as much as we are

1455
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,519
doesn't mean it has to be like bananas

1456
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,559
or everything is a cavish banana because

1457
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:28,318
it's grown for you know it's resistance

1458
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,000
since you know it's a let's hope it

1459
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:33,159
doesn't turn Banas well yeah cuz bananas

1460
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,760
already went through one Extinction so

1461
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,239
yeah but it is a good point and again

1462
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,280
like I said you see it out there with

1463
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,279
Austria being the capital of clones

1464
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,079
because they're doing it right and

1465
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,240
they're keeping them sterile and clean

1466
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:45,079
because in my opinion this is why I'm a

1467
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:47,078
gen seed grower and again why we get

1468
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,480
along so well is because I'm not in for

1469
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:49,920
I don't want someone else's problems

1470
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,079
that that's the thing I have with an

1471
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,960
issue with a lot of the Clone producers

1472
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,798
and I love how sterile and producers

1473
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,358
these days you have careful enough that

1474
00:52:57,798 --> 00:53:02,199
is very true with that because hot PL

1475
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:04,159
and verid transmits through seed

1476
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:06,279
production and a lot of people were like

1477
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,679
well what if it's just the donor that

1478
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,519
has it then will they get it through the

1479
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:13,798
pollen and the answer I believe is yes

1480
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,559
yeah you can get it from both parents

1481
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:18,119
you if they both have it you're going to

1482
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,559
get more like a a basically higher viral

1483
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:23,160
load and a larger population of your

1484
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,519
seeds getting it uh there's a lot we

1485
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:27,159
don't know about it still but there's

1486
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:29,679
quite a bit that we do yeah that's I

1487
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:31,399
respect Sharon that's why I respect

1488
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,838
getting stopped in secondary coming back

1489
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,920
from spannabis the other year was

1490
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:37,400
because unfortunately a GU with but we

1491
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,400
had seeds and you know they brought over

1492
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,240
you know obviously the the egg guy

1493
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,798
thankfully he was Pro cannabis his his

1494
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:44,039
mom and dad both grew of course he is

1495
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:45,960
from Northern California this a guy at

1496
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:47,400
LAX and you know so he's definitely

1497
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,679
supportive but he's like you know these

1498
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,119
these seeds aren't sterile like we don't

1499
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:51,960
know if these seeds are safe so

1500
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:53,760
unfortunately we can't let you bring and

1501
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,720
I totally respected it going to a school

1502
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,280
like calply with a bunch of Aggies like

1503
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:58,759
I understand it because to your point a

1504
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,480
lot of people don't realize that the

1505
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,960
seeds are but I think you see more of

1506
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,400
the white the widespread coming from the

1507
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,039
Clones because it's just it's the whole

1508
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,119
lot you know for sure so and I think the

1509
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,838
viral load is really small when it's

1510
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:15,240
from seed initially too and so as you

1511
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:17,199
take clonal Generations from that plant

1512
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:19,118
and that plant gets stressed out and and

1513
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:21,879
develops other things like systemic

1514
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,480
bacteria exactly and fungal pathogens

1515
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,079
then the Hop latent virus it's it's

1516
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,519
latent because it doesn't Express then

1517
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,839
it goes up so there's a lot of people

1518
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,119
that don't think they have it and they

1519
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:33,480
do have it 100% um and if you're in

1520
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,440
denial you probably definitely have it

1521
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,318
yeah um it's just another one of those

1522
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,280
problems within our industry it is but

1523
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:41,400
this is where again and you lead with

1524
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,400
education it's a full circle here we

1525
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,760
lead with education but the people are

1526
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,240
doing it right you know the lead with

1527
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,720
education help like your viewers

1528
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:50,798
understand why you do the things you do

1529
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,439
and how you do the things you do because

1530
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,039
you're wanting that end result to be a

1531
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,000
better finished product which is going

1532
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:57,920
back to why Jack so passionate about

1533
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,440
great this product like how can I make

1534
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,480
that M product better if not for my

1535
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,599
older brother who's a medical patient

1536
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,358
right for every user and every consumer

1537
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:08,359
of flower no matter where you are in

1538
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:10,279
what Market wherever flower is present

1539
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:12,199
like there's a way to optimize and make

1540
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,880
it better and lean into technology you

1541
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:16,318
know lean into technology 100% I mean

1542
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,079
that's really what we're doing it's like

1543
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,119
trying to do data driven breing and

1544
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,480
trying to improve everything that we do

1545
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,838
every time you know it's like sometimes

1546
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,358
we have to make gradual improvements

1547
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:29,719
over time but the idea is not to just

1548
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:31,880
just rest on our Laurels and you know we

1549
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:33,358
we figured it all out cuz it's just not

1550
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,559
like that there's so many things to be

1551
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:39,719
Innovative with in cannabis within this

1552
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:41,920
space Innovation is here but Innovation

1553
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:43,798
needs to continue on I think I'm seeing

1554
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,240
it like MJ biz for a couple years there

1555
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,639
wasn't much Innovation and we started

1556
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:49,479
seeing stuff with LED lights yep and now

1557
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:51,000
the LED Innovation is kind of taking

1558
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,000
over and we haven't stopped then they

1559
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,199
got under canopy right oh my God side

1560
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,599
canopy under canopy this is inner canopy

1561
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,639
under can canopy

1562
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,559
I think in every category of the

1563
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:05,118
ancillary side of the industry you seen

1564
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,200
that kind of play out yeah you know but

1565
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,000
I you know the rate of innovation slows

1566
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:12,000
the rate of consolidation accelerates

1567
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,358
you know it's not a lot of new ideas and

1568
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,239
lighting but you know they everyone

1569
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:18,598
agrees on what the you know the best

1570
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,318
ideas are there's intense competition

1571
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,079
driving you know those particular areas

1572
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:24,960
forward right like I think there is you

1573
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,798
know pretty cohes a lot of cohesion now

1574
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,599
LEDs LEDs forward I I think there's a

1575
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:32,358
lot of conversation about W observation

1576
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,760
and obviously just balancing red and

1577
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:37,480
blue red and blue spectrums right and I

1578
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,440
mean Spectrum tuning is a thing now uh

1579
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,559
it's not done right by everybody but I

1580
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,760
think people are understanding light

1581
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:45,519
spectrum a lot more you know now that

1582
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,520
you're able to tune the lights and it's

1583
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:50,280
like uh that's changing the game a

1584
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,920
little bit yeah and it's all these small

1585
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,039
Minor Adjustments that can make the

1586
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,920
product better what's the next one

1587
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,599
that's going to be hot the next

1588
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,599
Innovation that's going to be hot next

1589
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:00,359
area that everybody really nerds out on

1590
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,280
because I I think kind of the Innovation

1591
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:05,279
waves go based off category based off

1592
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,920
what people's talk you know focus on

1593
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,599
there's defin there's been a couple new

1594
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,480
way nutrient waves right uh there's been

1595
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,359
couple couple genetics and you know uh

1596
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,039
tissue culture and kind of w waves

1597
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:19,119
around on production it's been one wave

1598
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,480
around you know kind of post Harvest

1599
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,480
storage and post Harvest management yeah

1600
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,719
been a couple waves around facility

1601
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,838
Automation and and and management

1602
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:30,719
genetics has made their waves and

1603
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:34,078
constantly is making their

1604
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:36,399
waves gentics always will it's always

1605
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,720
going to be yeah and I think because

1606
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,559
that uh people are chasing flavors and

1607
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,318
they're they also there's these Trends

1608
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:45,440
and these trends go

1609
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:47,920
through show oh totally extractions you

1610
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,318
know I think we we're not fully there

1611
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,119
yet with extraction because they're

1612
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:54,079
still trying new things and coming out

1613
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:56,240
with new stuff I mean this Rosen wave is

1614
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,400
amazing what they've been doing with it

1615
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:00,639
but I mean also I think we can go back

1616
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,280
to hydrocarbon I have no problem with

1617
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:06,519
that really uh I've loved the evolution

1618
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,920
away from away from that as a natural

1619
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:09,480
thing yeah it's kind of weird I don't

1620
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,200
know like there's certain not that a

1621
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,798
huge concentrate again definitely lover

1622
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:16,118
of edibles but you know they are derived

1623
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:18,920
from concentrat so I found stuff that's

1624
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:20,480
like like your bhos and and CO2

1625
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,358
extractions for some reason just is

1626
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,679
different like I get hangovers it's

1627
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:25,480
different but I think being able to

1628
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,118
separate the cannaboids and for drug

1629
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,960
Discovery and other like that I think

1630
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,680
there's still like this wave that we

1631
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,920
haven't really got to yet now with

1632
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:37,639
Federal legalization on the on the

1633
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,880
horizon that's cuz you're a sungrown old

1634
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:43,279
head though s scient scientifically

1635
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,920
speaking brother like and you know I

1636
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,599
love you SCI scientifically speaking um

1637
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:54,000
there are tpping profiles and um

1638
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:57,599
cannaboids better captured

1639
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,239
um uh better captured with hydrocarbon

1640
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,119
extraction there there are certain

1641
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:02,759
profiles that are lost and more

1642
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,838
extraction there's certainly different

1643
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,640
processes that are more ideal for you

1644
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:10,078
know digestion versus topicals you know

1645
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:13,440
versus whatnot I mean I see sift coming

1646
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:16,200
so dry the dry sift in the static hash

1647
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,639
is now a thing I seeings coming back it

1648
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:19,159
is you know they're like they're making

1649
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:20,798
it out to be like a new process it's

1650
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:22,519
like no this is like one of the original

1651
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:24,280
processes we're just making it more

1652
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:25,679
advanced that's like hydrol man why

1653
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,240
doesn't everyone the guys up on the hill

1654
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,358
used to with you know just the trim

1655
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,879
stuff they' put through a hydrol and use

1656
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,159
his topicals and Stu like that stuff

1657
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,599
you'd love to see back I think the

1658
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:35,879
Innovation which is a good segue to go

1659
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,960
back to the question yeah the Innovation

1660
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:40,960
is going to be around how people view

1661
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,199
what they want to consume like I think

1662
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,358
it really is going to get to a point

1663
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:45,199
where people are finally going to get

1664
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:48,038
over this freaking hey with the highest

1665
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,639
THC wins [ __ ] and finally move into

1666
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:51,799
what is the profile for me which again

1667
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:53,879
goes back to why I love your genetics

1668
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:56,440
this is the future and I think part of

1669
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:59,280
it is convenience we live in this world

1670
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,480
that's very convenient so pens Rosen

1671
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,039
carts are great by the way AG I think

1672
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,838
that's been a great Innovation pushed

1673
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:08,839
forward and and done some really amazing

1674
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:10,358
things but hand rolls I call them hand

1675
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:12,519
rolls some people call them pre-rolls

1676
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:14,920
when you say handroll it it defines it

1677
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:17,358
as something that's more of a high-end

1678
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,480
product that hands actually touched it

1679
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,639
PR we think of the popcorn and the r

1680
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,240
people up in a blender and then make it

1681
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:26,000
that's not

1682
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:28,519
this I like I like the hand roll I mean

1683
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,920
I think it plays well into the culinary

1684
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:33,358
I side of things I think I think um

1685
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,358
Canabis is

1686
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:38,880
incly linked to to the culinary arts

1687
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:40,400
culinary business and I think a lot of

1688
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,559
our most successful colleagues in the

1689
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,400
space have very strong culinary

1690
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,920
background agreed um and I I think

1691
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,798
there's a lot of axum of thinking and

1692
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,480
values that transition very well between

1693
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:54,719
the two spaces and I think hand roll

1694
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,159
hand rolls app and it's it's a good name

1695
01:00:54,719 --> 01:01:00,879
but we have to remember you know is you

1696
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:03,038
know there's uh whole whole industry um

1697
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:05,200
or whole whole vast swast of the

1698
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:07,400
industry that are not for people that

1699
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:08,838
are enthusiasts you know it's difficult

1700
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,318
to remember but we have to remember that

1701
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:13,199
right I I been talking a lot about you

1702
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:14,920
know beer beer analogies lately and I

1703
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:17,038
think there's definitely some nuances

1704
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,920
between our our culture and you know

1705
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:23,640
cannabis and being a you know yeah being

1706
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:26,000
being a beerhead but uh there's 7,000

1707
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:27,480
crap Ries in the United States right and

1708
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,639
awesome they're people having fun and

1709
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,519
they're creating new category and

1710
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,679
they're doing good business and you know

1711
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:34,759
it's it's awesome it's fun but that's

1712
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:37,239
only about 10% of the beer consumption

1713
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,640
in the United States there's 16

1714
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:41,679
companies doing for that account for

1715
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:43,239
approximately the other 90% right even

1716
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:46,919
more than that I think it's it's six

1717
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:47,989
companies that are 60% of that must be C

1718
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,280
in cores

1719
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:51,279
[Laughter]

1720
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:57,559
twice I'm that study but I yeah I don't

1721
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,318
think we're crazy far away from that

1722
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:00,760
cannabis cannabis is Consolidated far

1723
01:01:59,318 --> 01:02:03,278
more rapidly than I well it's like the

1724
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,559
pre-rolls that make the most money as

1725
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:08,599
far as like take up the largest part of

1726
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:12,079
the market share are the one gr y dollar

1727
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:14,760
joints dude it's crazy you saw in Canada

1728
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:17,119
not just us quar too yeah

1729
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,559
half their time what gets sold mostly is

1730
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,400
those cheap cheap whether it's one1 or2

1731
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,880
joints people love those you know

1732
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,960
because you get high and it's cheap and

1733
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,039
a lot of people are okay with not having

1734
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,639
the best of the best I try to chase the

1735
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:31,720
best because I want to be the craft guy

1736
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:33,679
right at the end of the day think that's

1737
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:35,919
my identity right we all have identities

1738
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,558
on who we are and what type of Market

1739
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,200
we're trying to capture I mean I want

1740
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,160
something for everybody too so if you

1741
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,519
look on my site for seeds like we have

1742
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:45,519
stuff that's priced where it's priced

1743
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,119
for everybody I have stuff that's $500 a

1744
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,519
pack right for for five seeds or 10

1745
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:52,039
seeds five seeds I think for 500 is the

1746
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:53,719
most expensive thing but we have some

1747
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:56,278
stuff where for 45 bucks you can get a

1748
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:58,919
pack of seeds right and so there

1749
01:02:56,278 --> 01:03:00,480
business school models for for this crap

1750
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,599
right you know that the the Brads and

1751
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,559
Chads and thads you know brought us

1752
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,798
right and Kens

1753
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:11,920
yeah can't exclude the

1754
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:13,559
Kens definitely the k k Ken yeah yeah

1755
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,000
and not that you know Brads and thads

1756
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:18,798
and Chads aren't aren't diverse and

1757
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,480
aren't really just a you know a you know

1758
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,599
broad broad term I think you know you

1759
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,000
got your fundamental you know your you

1760
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:26,519
know value proposition your you know

1761
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,960
middle of the road and then your your

1762
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:30,838
highend I think where a lot of us in

1763
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,559
this space really have thought about is

1764
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:36,278
is a very linear very polar thing where

1765
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:38,640
you're either you know w l you're either

1766
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:39,838

you know particularly with the the

1853

01:06:35,798 --> 01:06:39,920
that's a a very hot button topic right

1856
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,599
but absolutely in terms of just having

1857
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,798
the you know the the you know passion

1858
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:48,119
for something as a holistically as an

1859
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:50,759
organization you know to founder aside

1860
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:52,880
right let's put that aside yeah to try

1861
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,680
to open source things and and do thought

1862
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,720
leadership and push the space forward

1863
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:58,598
and you know being transparent well at

1864
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,199
first off you know one of our biggest

1865
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,920
accomplish you know their accomplish

1866
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,639
business they've dramatically pushed you

1867
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,000
know electric vehicle and that that

1868
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:07,679
conversation for it and everything else

1869
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,079
right I think that that kind of and then

1870
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:10,919
they're keeping up with it of course

1871
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:13,240
they're electric car you know rival

1872
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,720
businesses yeah right you know who who

1873
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:16,399
cares this is you know this is a great

1874
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,318
thing for the world I think that kind of

1875
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,880
that abundance that growth that that

1876
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:21,558
attitude of you know you're not going to

1877
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,079
out innovate us we're we're telling you

1878
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:25,680
this we're not we're not telling you

1879
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:27,359
we're working on right now

1880
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,159
that stuff we've already worked on well

1881
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,038
and it's there's a Solutions based

1882
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:32,239
company right so are you and so am I I

1883
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:35,119
feel like that's one thing that

1884
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:37,118
separates Great companies from the rest

1885
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,318
of the world right this if you have a

1886
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,640
problem that you're a solution to that's

1887
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:41,798
how you're going to be successful

1888
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:43,719
exactly true and you find too you know

1889
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:45,480
for us there's you know imitated never

1890
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:46,838
replicated it's interesting because not

1891
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,278
all bags are created equal that will

1892
01:07:46,838 --> 01:07:49,798
probably be our next marketing campaign

1893
01:07:48,278 --> 01:07:51,159
because absolutely you know I've explain

1894
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:53,358
to these guys having been in a few

1895
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:55,038
rodeos you know when you're the leader

1896
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:57,038
the biggest Targets on your back you

1897
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,440
know and so that's something we're

1898
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,278
starting to realize you know the ankle

1899
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,720
biters are are biting because they're

1900
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:03,798
seeing what we're doing but the one

1901
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:04,759
thing that we know and no matter if it's

1902
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:06,079
people who think they're direct

1903
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,119
competitors or people are trying to

1904
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:10,318
replicate you know we're in a totally

1905
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:11,599
different position because unlike them

1906
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:12,920
we're actually a part of this community

1907
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,838
we're actually people who know

1908
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,520
experience and use this product and

1909
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:19,198
believe in it you know and it came from

1910
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:21,120
from those that grow from the start so

1911
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,479
definitely you know a big factor in it

1912
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,880
as well yeah and I think you know for

1913
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:27,639
awesome you know account and

1914
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,520
formulations we talk about you know

1915
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,759
something that's patented right you know

1916
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,199
it's very easy to move an inert

1917
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:37,198
hydrocarbon from here to here yeah um

1918
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:39,519
you know it's it's a brutal space you

1919
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,479
know being being in you know chemical

1920
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,520
formulations which is essentially you

1921
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:45,678
know what dirt block is so we have to

1922
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,600

01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:55,480
our partners with our our supply chain

1926
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:57,439
but it's it's constantly have to be at

1927
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:59,479
innovating if if you know somebody you

1928
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,479
know completely eliminates you know

1929
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:02,919
passive you know map packaging is like

1930
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:05,599
the best solution to this like it's

1931
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,838
going to be us yeah yeah yeah you know

1932
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,039
maybe we've been lucky for that maybe

1933
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,479
we're in The Perfect Storm for that

1934
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:12,000
being in canis which is so fluid that

1935
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,318
having that that you know the fluid

1936
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,798
attitude and the attitude of oh we've

1937
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,960
got to build stuff where the space is

1938
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,158
headed instead of where the space is at

1939
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,880
you know maybe we've just been very

1940
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:21,639
lucky with that but you have a good team

1941
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,960
too you're the Innovation you guys have

1942
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,920
done I mean the bin liner for instance a

1943
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,838
lot of people don't even know you have a

1944
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,399
bin liner you have a bin liner you know

1945
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:31,238
it's a lot of people don't know

1946
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,238
different things

1947
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,759
like lot of back sizes like Ry like Ryan

1948
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:39,600
carnavali and Jang were like you know

1949
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,719
filling filling different bags and you

1950
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,319
know hand making bags with the hair

1951
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:46,000
straightener standardize the bag sizes

1952
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,000
for this industry that have you know

1953
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,479
probably a billion billions of bags been

1954
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,640
made for for the space now yeah or or

1955
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:56,919
case packs you know um my father was in

1956
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,800
in a way you packaging distribution and

1957
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,960
you know did all sorts of Jans and stuff

1958
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,600
he was like guys case back pounds are so

1959
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,239
interesting like why why is that you

1960
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,560
know I can't believe the soon us his

1961
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,279
case packs like well I will tell you why

1962
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,920
you know it's actually it's because we

1963
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:12,599
couldn't afford boxes yeah yeah like

1964
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,039
that's why the case packs were huge but

1965
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,920
we're constantly trying to stay ahead to

1966
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:17,920
your point for specifically the tot

1967
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,279
liner we just widen that by two inches

1968
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,199
because all of a sudden there's more

1969
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:22,960
than just HDX or or what we grew up

1970
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:24,238
calling black and yellows yeah out there

1971
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,239
you're starting to see black and reds

1972
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,479
black and greens not all of them are

1973
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:29,879
uniform in size so we had a few friends

1974
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:31,919
that were like hey dude I'm kind of

1975
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:35,239
having to stretch this what's

1976
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,359
up adjust custom stuff that we do for

1977
01:10:35,238 --> 01:10:40,359
facilities that are running you know

1978
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:44,279
some of the the call factory farms huge

1979
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:47,039
facilities have very different the theop

1980
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:49,519
once you're getting over you know 60,000

1981
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,600
Square ft of cannabis space and you know

1982
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,520
the tools and processes really changed

1983
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,520
dramatically that's where those guys the

1984
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,840
thing that I you know I or I should say

1985
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,080
the the they don't change that

1986
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,239
dramatically the scale but changed

1987
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:02,760
dramatically it's still turog and it's

1988
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:04,439
still still a still the same container

1989
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,039
but it's it's an agricultural container

1990
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:08,399
that the guys are using in the avocado

1991
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:10,880
space yeah wow it's an sop that and you

1992
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:12,359
see that here you know we just turn a

1993
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,600
facility where they're running our pound

1994
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:16,559
bags but then going over to Europe where

1995
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,600
they're running our 5 kilo bags I mean

1996
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,480
that's a that's a 10 pound bag yeah

1997
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,560
that's

1998
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:24,759
full so to to Jack's point but those are

1999
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,719
licensed producers you know that are on

2000
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,280
the medical side into his point it is

2001
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,520
more of an objective a perspective

2002
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:32,198
versus a passionate guy who got opened

2003
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,080
up an opportunity to start being a

2004
01:11:32,198 --> 01:11:35,678
master grower at this big operation you

2005
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:38,119
know it's quite interesting yeah and

2006
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,880
like man shout out to Austria that's the

2007
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:41,439
that's the triangle of Europe right

2008
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,400
there I've learned yeah there's so many

2009
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:44,678
guys I meet like all over Europe and

2010
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,839
it's like where's your own shirt or like

2011
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,520
where's your plug or like you know it's

2012
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:52,760
Austria yeah yeah I guess the

2013
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,560
legislative environment and um just made

2014
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:58,360
it a right place yeah yeah right place

2015
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,639
right time yeah exactly so I got a

2016
01:11:58,359 --> 01:12:02,039
question for you for sealing your bags

2017
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:04,880
CU a lot of people have bags and they

2018
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:07,079
want to seal them what is the best way I

2019
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,920
know they have some conveyor sealers

2020
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:11,119
yeah the the one I recommend I mean it's

2021
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:13,199
literally like 15 20 bucks on Amazon as

2022
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:15,399
an example but you've got the

2023
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,039
traditional kind of press heat sealers

2024
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:18,759
um that's what I use at home like I said

2025
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:20,279
was an inexpensive first time buy you

2026
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,719
can use a ceramic hair straightener if

2027
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:23,960
you just do a couple presses on and

2028
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:26,198
basically the way you seal bags is a

2029
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:28,000
combination of heat andw time 12 times

2030
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:29,638
essentially how long you're spending on

2031
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,439
each part you don't want to melt it but

2032
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:34,039
you do it it is the the material

2033
01:12:32,439 --> 01:12:36,319
structuring way where it's supposed to

2034
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:37,760
heat seal quickly so you know I often

2035
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:40,840
times will use my fiance's hair

2036
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:43,440
straightener to stra yeah I've used like

2037
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:46,000
the V seal

2038
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,638
yeah you can use any number of heat

2039
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,920
sealers you you know I you don't need

2040
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,319
because of the nature of this material

2041
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,440
and the nature of cannabis we would

2042
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:56,238
contend that you don't need do vacuum

2043
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:58,479
flush um cannabis but the heat sealer

2044
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:02,198
set to a a low temperature and a quicker

2045
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:04,479
D time is ideal you know um given the

2046
01:13:02,198 --> 01:13:05,839
structure that we run you material

2047
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,158
structure you want to use a lower

2048
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,880
temperature it's a non-metal it's a

2049
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:12,198
non-metalized structure right it's

2050
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,199
definitely one that I always take some

2051
01:13:12,198 --> 01:13:16,079
of these I've obviously had a few of

2052
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:18,439
your new ones in my bag I always travel

2053
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,439
in my backpack and then for me at hotels

2054
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,759
I just take a an iron literally just

2055
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:22,960
bust the iron out and do it on the

2056
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,880
countertop and you're doing it in

2057
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,719
delicate any way or you know and just to

2058
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,119
his point just let it dwell for like 5

2059
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,920
10 seconds perfect seal yeah set and go

2060
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:32,960
no not even I'm like two

2061
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:36,039
Mississippi and then you can always

2062
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,239
another two Mississippi yeah yeah the

2063
01:13:36,039 --> 01:13:39,399
worse is like you're traveling around

2064
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:41,599
Europe and like you damaged the back

2065
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:43,119
yeah yeah so I got some questions for

2066
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,400
you about the business and about

2067
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,039
building the business what are some of

2068
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:47,679
the things you learned along the way

2069
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:50,079
with building a business you'd like to

2070
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:53,000
share you learn a lot by doing so many

2071
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:54,880
things wrong so yeah that's a whole

2072
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,600
another that's a whole another podcast

2073
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,639
yeah

2074
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,840
gosh I don't know uh it's all about

2075
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:05,239
people I think the by far the most

2076
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:07,480
important thing I I do is is who who is

2077
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:11,079
on the team and and how I support them

2078
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:13,519
and try to keep them you know what what

2079
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:16,279
they need I think you know I think it's

2080
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,880
a it's a Kaizen thing right I'm talking

2081
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:22,079
about you know it's it's a it's a daily

2082
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:24,560
aspiration right I think you know a a

2083
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:26,639
business Journey or entrepreneurial

2084
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,080
Journey you know it's lot you know I've

2085
01:14:26,639 --> 01:14:31,639
grown up in this business right I

2086
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:35,760
started this company you know um with

2087
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:38,639
with you know uh Ryan um gosh you know

2088
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,600
nine years ago March yeah and so I've

2089
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:42,520
you know very much grown up in in in

2090
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,920
this industry and you know my my

2091
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:48,040
worldview is shaped by this industry so

2092
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,079
to speak in certain ways but I think um

2093
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:52,639
who you have and how you how you you

2094
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,559
take care of them and you know try to

2095
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:56,279
you know have what they need you know I

2096
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,120
think people people can't do great

2097
01:14:56,279 --> 01:15:00,639
creative work if they don't feel safe

2098
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:02,599
you know I've always strived to have an

2099
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:03,800
environment where people feel safe and

2100
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,880
they feel secure and they have an

2101
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:08,960
opportunity to experiment right I think

2102
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,480
um Warren Buffett said it best you know

2103
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,198
he was God what was he what was he

2104
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:17,799
trying to fix um at the time I forget it

2105
01:15:14,198 --> 01:15:19,678
was the bank he took over um and uh he

2106
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,560
was talking about you know tell one if

2107
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,158
you lose the firm a little bit of money

2108
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,560
you know I'll be understanding if if you

2109
01:15:23,158 --> 01:15:27,439
damage the firm's reputation if you

2110
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,280
take advantage of a customer if you know

2111
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,759
if you you know if you do something

2112
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,319
unethical I'll be ruthless and that's

2113
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,079
the the balance the environment you want

2114
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:38,238
to ideally strive for but a lot of is

2115
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:40,519
you have to have a product people love I

2116
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:42,158
think for for us we were very lucky to

2117
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,120
develop something that people found a

2118
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:47,519
lot of value in um I think you know that

2119
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:49,319
and not getting too over your skis you

2120
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,000
know not getting too much of nicker

2121
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:53,439
syndrome you know not getting to the

2122
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,639
point like a made we made some money

2123
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,119
this month let me let me look at these

2124
01:15:54,639 --> 01:15:59,760
ports calculate payments during the work

2125
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:03,479
day I think and work for that yeah I

2126
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:06,199
think people people sense that you got

2127
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:08,559
to be you got to got to

2128
01:16:06,198 --> 01:16:10,638
know who you are what you're good at

2129
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,840

2130
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:15,719

2133
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:22,238

2152
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,360
doing anything and everything whatever I

2153
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:04,039

01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,319
of owning a business is yeah loving the

I've had some really lucky days than the

2160
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:20,239
best days I've had doing other things

2161
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:21,759
yeah so yeah not the easiest but

2162
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:22,919
definitely the most rewarding that's a

2163
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,560
lot of people I'm sure in your travels

2164
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,079
too James you're like you know because I

2165
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,639
never push on people to ask what what I

2166
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:30,198
do or what I'm in town for and tell them

2167
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:32,319
and Serv as the Canabis community and

2168
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:34,039
tell the history and like man you must

2169
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:35,759
love I'm like I do love it but it's some

2170
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:37,319
of the hardest work I've ever done you

2171
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,039
know and it's crazy but that's what

2172
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:42,158
makes it so rewarding and a lot of

2173
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:44,000
people like a question these are cliche

2174
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,198
podcast questions like oh what would you

2175
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,600
recommend or what would you tell someone

2176
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:48,399
wants to get in the business a lot of

2177
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,920
people in this industry tell them to run

2178
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:51,158
and I'm like no if you're passionate if

2179
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,359
you're just a passionate person you

2180
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:55,039
don't have to be passionate we we did an

2181
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:57,439
internal audit when I was at weed map we

2182
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:59,158
had about 400 employees at the time and

2183
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:02,198
just did a fun survey just an internal

2184
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:04,279
survey 34% of those individuals did not

2185
01:18:02,198 --> 01:18:05,279
consume which is totally fine but they

2186
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,399
were passionate people they were

2187
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:08,238
passionate about customer service

2188
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:10,079
they're passionate about webdev we're

2189
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:12,000
passionate about branding whatever the

2190
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:13,319
case may be now we're fortunate we do

2191
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,960
have a bunch of consumers and several

2192
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:18,000
Growers we have lot of people that

2193
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:20,079
aren't unique culture you know yeah I

2194
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,560
think culture is a just like cannabis

2195
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:25,198
that's a a fluid you know living thing

2196
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:28,320
that's something we're always know

2197
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:31,678
aspiring for you know I you know I I

2198
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:34,679
wish I you know uh when I

2199
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,920
was what 24 I wish I knew everything I

2200
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:38,520
knew now or had the perspective I

2201
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,319
thought I knew everything when I was 24

2202
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:43,159
you stop Lear you stop living back about

2203
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:45,238
some stuff and I'm just like man how did

mouth yeah it's like [ __ ] yeah I did I I

2207

2208
01:18:53,319 --> 01:18:57,279
crooked but uh

2209
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,719
yeah it's it's interesting growing up

2210
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,679
and then evolving and getting older yeah

2211
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:04,039
you know and then this space but if

2212

you're passionate and you want to be in

2213
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:08,719
cannabis there's a space for you it's

2214
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,800
not like Tech it's not winter Tech all

love and create a sustainable business

2217
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:15,238

2221
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,679
of the guys on the eight range you feel

2222
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:25,639
a lot more fulfilled than some of the

2223
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,440
guys in the 800 range yeah and you know

2224
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:30,400
I'm sure vice versa to a certain degree

2225
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:33,198

like the restaurant business you got to

2242
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,480
you got to come

2243
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:11,119
correct your last meal exactly you're

2244
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,599
only good as your last seed or your last

2245
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:15,800
jar or your your last bag your last bag

2246
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,400
you know I think that there's so much

2247
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,800
truth to that and if you can have that

2248
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:21,519
hard work ethic with a bunch of passion

2249
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,760
you can do anything and you can't again

2250
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,040
it's a story I tell this is phenomenal

2251
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,360
this guy he was um in the military

2252
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:30,000
active had definitely some top level

2253
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:32,039
clearance at the Pentagon told me his

2254
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,399
whole story reached out on LinkedIn he

2255
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:35,119
said he's passionate about the plant he

2256
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:37,559
can't consume because of obviously his

2257
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:39,000
career and the choices he made uh but he

2258
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,320
said as soon as he got his honorable

2259
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,920
discharge he's going to get into it he

2260
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:43,799
reached out to me a couple years later

2261
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,119
and he's managing an operation down in

2262
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,719
Miami and I'm like I'm so happy for you

2263
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:50,599
he was passionate he never consumed the

2264
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:52,480
plant because of his career at the time

2265
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,120
and he made the successful transition

2266
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:56,198
and people had asked to your point like

2267
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:57,840
there's OPP I've never worked in an

2268
01:20:56,198 --> 01:21:00,119
industry where there's so much

2269
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,360
opportunity when you look HR sales

2270
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:04,039
marketing pharmaceutical Logistics

2271
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:07,000
Securities

2272
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:09,519
geneticists scientists I mean there's so

2273
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,439
much need in this space it's almost

2274
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,520
trivial so for someone to go like I'm

2275
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:14,000
passionate about the plant but I don't

2276
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:15,600
know how to get in I'm like there's

2277
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,119
plenty of options for you to get in you

2278
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,360
got to and you got to start small I

2279
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,039
think a lot of people like I want to be

2280
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:21,880
a breeder and it's like dude learn how

2281
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:23,639
to grow the plant first right like there

2282
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,600
there's there's levels to this stuff and

2283
01:21:23,639 --> 01:21:27,000
there's it's just like in in The

2284
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,039
Culinary world and that's why I think

2285
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,600
there's a good you can start out as a

2286
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:34,560
dishwasher or a water boy in cannabis

2287
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,800
and end up being a big big time seed

2288
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,679
breeder or being a big time cultivator

2289
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,719
or have a product where along the way

2290
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:42,399
you're like dude I I want to make a bag

2291
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,239
that's better than all the other bags

2292
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,158
yeah you know I think exactly true you

2293
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:48,198
know we live in America and it's the you

2294
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:50,599
know I think we there still is the

2295
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:51,879
American dream it still is alive I think

2296
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,760
that a lot of people are like oh it's

2297
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,480
gone no the American dream's still there

2298
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,520
you got to fight for and you got to want

2299
01:21:55,479 --> 01:22:00,319
it and I think persistence pays off so

2300
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,280
huge especially in the market that we're

2301
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:05,119
at and maybe it it's not as easy as it

2302
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:06,880
was in the 50s for the American dream no

2303
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:08,279
or even for the California Dream but

2304
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,279
you're right it does still exist and the

2305
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:12,238
thing is and it's unfortunate is with

2306
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:13,599
the younger Generations because they've

2307
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,198
almost kind of been brainwashed on it's

2308
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,440
easy and it fingers length and oh I can

2309
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:19,079
DJ because I've got this kit or or I can

2310
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:20,919
be an influencer I can be an influencer

2311
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:22,880
CU I know how to break dance like hey we

2312
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,920
all break dance when we were kids but

2313
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,920
the thing is like nothing's easy and all

2314
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,639
these shortcuts and all these hacks that

2315
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,279
everyone's putting focus on the most

2316
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,880
successful still it's hard work there's

2317
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,800
very few people that handed their first

2318
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,760
million and Warren Buffett's a

2319
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,880
phenomenal example you know there's

2320
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,800
Steve Jobs is a great example Bill Gates

2321
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,600
is a great example like there's enough

2322
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,039
individuals that are in our lifetime not

2323
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,079
from the Industrial

2324
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:49,079
Revolution just like just show up like

2325
01:22:47,079 --> 01:22:52,238
genuinely try that's half the job

2326
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:53,960
genuinely try to be genuinely genuinely

2327
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:56,319
try to do the right thing like try to

2328
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:58,158
create with the way you do business and

2329
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:01,679
don't be a [ __ ] douchebag that's like

2330
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:05,198
90% of it right there that's 90% I agree

2331
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:06,440
no or Karens yeah yeah well and those

2332
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:08,719
people get weeded out you know what I

2333
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:10,158
mean like they may have they have some

2334
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,639
of them have and some of them still need

2335
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:13,559
to get weeded out but but do you

2336
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:15,359
remember back in 2018 man there's a lot

2337
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,159
like when the Funny Money started moving

2338
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:18,839
out of it like a lot of those guys that

2339
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:20,960
I'm a master grower wait you're LinkedIn

2340
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,279
says you're a yoga instructor last year

2341
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,399
help me understand how you're a master

2342
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:26,439
grower in Industry well I've been

2343
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:27,679
consuming since iist St I I I sit it on

2344
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:29,039
stage one time I'm like I've been going

2345
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,960
to a bathroom since I'm a kid that

2346
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,039
doesn't make me a urologist that doesn't

2347
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,480
mean I know everything going on man just

2348
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:37,000
because I'm associated with it yeah and

2349
01:23:35,479 --> 01:23:39,279
I mean these things you know we have

2350
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,319
this un instability in the market which

2351
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:43,960
I think over time changes we be we

2352
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:47,319
develop a more stable Market more stable

2353
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:49,198
with genetics less companies for for the

2354
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:52,039
better in some ways you know and some

2355
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:54,158
some ways it can be sad but I think you

2356
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:55,560
know we weed out the the bad Growers

2357
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:58,158
those guys aren't going to be around

2358
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:00,000
correct um I don't think those guys most

2359
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,799
of those guys aren't around anymore yeah

2360
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,439
most of those guys are not around I

2361
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,279
don't realize the base level operator of

2362
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:08,879
a lot of Growers right now like is much

2363
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:11,238
higher than it used to be the average is

2364
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,440
very high three years ago yeah the

2365
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:16,959
average is much higher and I'm talking

2366
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:19,519
globally yeah and then beyond that oh my

2367
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:22,000
God like nobody wants to talk about this

2368

there's something something to it like

2416
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:07,719
but they're talking about well they

2417
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:09,559
don't refer to the Drew State brand as

2418
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:12,319
flavored they don't use the f word it's

2419
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:14,159
not flavored it's infused right right

2420
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:15,759
that's and like we're doing you know

2421
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:18,479
with these these hemp packs and

2422
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,440
infusions and stuff and I think I think

2423
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,279
that's they're doing they're doing stuff

2424
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:23,279
in wreck that's infused they're doing

2425
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:25,000
you know I think there's some of these

2426
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:26,439
brands that are really pushing that and

2427
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,279
to smoke it through a backwoods where it

2428
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:30,759
still tastes good yep you know oh

2429
01:26:28,279 --> 01:26:33,319

2432
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:40,719
that is that like that is a there's no

2433
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,600
way that's a naturally occurring tpine

2434
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,960
like I know too much about flavorings

2435
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,520
just T like I I know wait watermelon

2436
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,079

2437
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,719
watermelon bub gum I've seen bubblegum

2438
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:53,719
TPS that are bubble gum Expressions that

2439
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:54,840
are very bu like the real bubble gum if

2440
01:26:53,719 --> 01:26:56,520
you get to

2441
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,319
the Indiana or wherever you want to say

2442
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,600
it's from I mean there's a big argument

2443
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:02,559
over that been going forever but that

2444
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,679
bubblegum it definitely smells bubble

2445
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,400
gum on the plant but when you go to

2446
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,279
smoke it you don't get the translation

2447
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:10,759
of as the bubble gum y but I have smoked

2448
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:12,679
bubble gum flavored cannabis it's very

2449
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:14,679
in fact we have one right now

2450
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:16,679
billionaire bubble gum it's coming up

2451
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:18,800
it's pretty bubble gum I'll have to get

2452
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:20,520
some for you so you can go bubble gums

2453
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,760
like this is this is a turbine this is a

2454
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:25,080
a expressional plan I feel qualified in

2455
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,239
you know I'm not going to go out here

2456
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:29,679
and say I have you know like you know

2457
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:31,439
Ryan from Doge as you know pal or

2458
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,920
anything that that's someone we all

2459
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:36,599
agree inside and out yeah you know no

2460
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:39,600
smoke but I I know that turp at least

2461
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:42,039
and telling you it's had an artificial

2462
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,560
character to it yeah I don't I don't I

2463
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:45,158
hope there's not a future for it I'm too

2464
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:47,400
much purist but then again I don't spool

2465
01:27:45,158 --> 01:27:48,920
with tobacco so that's I don't hate on

2466
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:49,920
anybody for anything you know I mean so

2467
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,880
if you want to do it and there's a

2468
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,399
market for it good for you I mean

2469
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,039
whatever like I'm too busy to worry

2470
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:57,158
about what other people doing really

2471
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,158
yeah it's just it's true and as a

2472
01:27:57,158 --> 01:28:01,079
breeder I want to be breeding those new

2473
01:27:59,158 --> 01:28:02,599
cultivars and those new varieties where

2474
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:04,319
you're like wow that's something

2475
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,159
different that that checks the boxes for

2476
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:07,679
me or I introduce some something new

2477
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:08,960
that nobody's ever tried before or

2478
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,480
bringing the old with the new which is

2479
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,960
what I love that you you you know you're

2480
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,519
doing more of how's how's the

2481
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,800
conversation going to switch from from Z

2482
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:19,560
turps and Z crosses I'm as guilty as

2483
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,000
anybody I've been smoking a lot of uh

2484
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:25,320
candy camer right now and candy candy

2485
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,960
fumes really of it right so so how it

2486
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:28,880
goes is now we're leaning more towards

2487
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,600
the gas right so it's still is candy but

2488
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,760
they're like I want gas with my candy

2489
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,960
and now it doesn't have to be dark

2490
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,400
purple we're okay with like a little bit

2491
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,920
of purple in there but we still want

2492
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:40,479
that purple for whatever reason I think

2493
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,279
that people think it gives it's the the

2494
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:44,118
bag appeal it it's the bag appeal right

2495
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:47,639
all it is it's it's Instagram and social

2496
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:47,639
media that's kind of shifted

2497
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:53,600
our like get the real purple you know so

2498
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,079
Instagram has shifted our perception of

2499
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:59,159
what good cannabis is it's got to fit on

2500
01:28:56,079 --> 01:29:02,399
the the jar right has three to five NS

2501
01:28:59,158 --> 01:29:05,000
yeah yeah right there's all little and I

2502
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:06,920
grew up where the the worst looking weed

2503
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,079
was the very best weed like literally it

2504
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:13,199
did not look good but it smoked amazing

2505
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,679
tasted crazy and the effect was amazing

2506
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:17,479
like we we had that was our focus in the

2507
01:29:14,679 --> 01:29:20,079
90s it was like man it looked like swag

2508
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:22,079
in a bag I mean there was we had some

2509
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:24,359
purple stuff that that came from up

2510
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:26,000
North that was like pretend right where

2511
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:28,359
you smoked it it looked amaz like it

2512
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,238
would check the boxes for bag appeal now

2513
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:33,000
but when you smoked it it was like man

2514
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:35,319
this is like [ __ ] CBD like before CBD

2515
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,840
was a thing this was it I didn't like

2516
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:38,719
that stuff but in today's market that

2517
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,279
stuff would probably sell because the

2518
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,359
way it looked y but there is there is a

2519
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:45,960
market for the effect and there you know

2520
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:47,279
it has to be a certain yeah it has to

2521
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,319
give you a certain effect if it doesn't

2522
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:51,559
give you any effect it's kind of like I

2523
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:53,238
think I think the consumers today are

2524
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:54,639
kind of spoiled to be candid I know it

2525
01:29:53,238 --> 01:29:56,319
might be a little again a little

2526
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:59,079
provocative to say but like to your

2527
01:29:56,319 --> 01:30:00,920
point we had to sacrifice a lot in the

2528
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:03,238
80s and 90s and you talked to someone

2529
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:06,840
like Kevin jodry you know who talks

2530
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:09,759
about how the War on Drugs Daryl Gates

2531
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:12,039
perpetuated by Nancy Reagan War on Drugs

2532
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,039
that we grew up with in the 80s that

2533
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:15,279
100% took a lot of the turps out of the

2534
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:16,639
equation because all of a sudden the

2535
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:18,399
guys weren't just having to hide under

2536
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:20,800
canopy but they were having to hide the

2537
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:23,158
the smell the scent up on the hill too

2538
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,880
so that's something that all of a sudden

2539
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:26,879
just drove this PIV shift into more

2540
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:29,840
conservative cultivars that weren't

2541
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,279
nearly as gassy or as as spicy as what

2542
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,679
we're accustomed to and that did affect

2543
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,840
the bag appeal I mean to your point I

2544
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:37,520
remember northern lights in my opinion

2545
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:38,679
looked gorgeous looked fabulous but

2546
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,719
there was a lot of people that didn't

2547
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:40,840
have the same opinion they thought it

2548
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:43,639
was too green they thought it was too

2549
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:46,319
funky it's too round too fluffy a bud

2550
01:30:43,639 --> 01:30:47,960
compared to again your Durban or your AK

2551
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:49,960
whatever it was that was popping up at

2552
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,359
the time so it's really interesting how

2553
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:54,319
to your point IG is person and in the

2554
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:56,880
over manicuring that's another I think

2555
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,759
you and I both rough cut man the amount

2556
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,079
of over manicuring that still happens

2557
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:02,840
and I do kind of blame that more on the

2558
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:05,439
SoCal indoor scene yeah it's excessive

2559
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:07,360
man sugar leaves need love too like they

2560
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:10,238
they've got Turpin they've got tricomes

2561
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,679
you know yeah so it's it's crazy I grew

2562
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:13,678
up and all my personal when I would grow

2563
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:15,520
would go in jars and basically we would

2564
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,840
leave the the sugar leaves on you know

2565
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,040
what I mean and then finger trim them

2566
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,560
off

2567
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:23,399
yep in fact I was still doing that in

2568
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,800
2018 yeah so you and I both I know I've

2569
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:26,479
seen yours and some people question I'm

2570
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,719
like I love rough cutting man there's no

2571
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:30,039
need like what am I to do turn it into

2572
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:32,118
Edibles which I

2573
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:33,560
do but I don't need to it's still

2574
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:35,479
smokable the stuff we're seeing today

2575
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:37,760
was so super Frosty I don't even know is

2576
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:39,678
some sort of some sort of cookies cross

2577
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,280
and this stuff was super Frosty funny

2578
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:43,719
I've been seen a lot of cookies crosses

2579
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:45,439
coming back I'm kind of hoping that we

2580
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:47,039
get more cookies coming back I think

2581
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:48,599
cookies is cool I mean other than the

2582
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:50,880
fact that it has a bunch it's not

2583
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,119
herming the [ __ ] out in your gr well

2584
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,639
that's that's the that's the main

2585
01:31:52,118 --> 01:31:55,559
problem that's why so many things Herm

2586
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:58,079
now is because they all have a lot of

2587
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,760
cookies in them and Inter I think it's

2588
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:02,238
been stabilized a lot more it has it has

2589
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,039
been totally stabilized more but you

2590
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:06,000
there is still a whole bunch of stuff to

2591
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:09,039
Herms even some of the good stuff and

2592
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,319
it's like Mike from exotic basically

2593
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:15,519
changed my opinion on the whole Herm in

2594
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:17,198
sex expression and he's like he he had

2595
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,679
told me because I was complaining about

2596
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,799
it and I'm like well dude like and then

2597
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:22,480
I was complaining because some people

2598
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,159
complain about my stuff having interx

2599
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:25,919
Expressions yeah and I tried that used

2600
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:27,759
to be my main thing is I don't want any

2601
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,079
interex Expressions any of my seeds if

2602
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:33,840
it has interex I'm but then you miss in

2603
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:35,238
what Mike to his point was that then

2604
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,480
you're going to miss out on TPS

2605
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:39,039
potentially and he's absolutely correct

2606
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:40,919
some of the stuff that I have I I

2607
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,479
definitely put it on the packaging and

2608
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,520
we actually we put it on the like if you

2609
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,158
look in the description on our website

2610
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,679
there's stuff that I will tell people

2611
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:50,079
you it has intersex traits but I'm not

2612
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,679
going to prevent people from germinating

2613
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,559
those seeds and trying those things

2614
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,760
because it has I mean if you want to try

2615
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:57,280
them I think there's some amazing TPS

2616
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,239
that you get out of some stuff that has

2617
01:32:57,279 --> 01:33:01,920
intersex trades yeah and over time we

2618
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,158
can get rid of the intersex trades I

2619
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,840
mean now with with some of the data that

2620
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:08,799
we have and with the sequencing they've

2621
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,760
already identified uh potential markers

2622
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,600
to be able to get rid of intersects

2623
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,480
powdery mildew resistance all these

2624
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,400
things so more into the technology see

2625
01:33:15,479 --> 01:33:19,000
naturally in different land races right

2626
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:21,079
the reason land races are prevalent in

2627
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,840
different areas is you know often you

2628
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:24,639
know you have you know Turing profiles

2629
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,960
and Bud structures that are more adapt

2630
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:30,639
to the realized the environment there a

2631
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,198
a Durban is very uh very good for an aid

2632
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,760
you know South African environment

2633
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:37,519
whereas you know Golden Buddha is very

2634
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:40,039
moldes in you know the way it the way

2635
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:42,960
those you know bigger colas are they're

2636
01:33:40,039 --> 01:33:44,719
more humidity resistant right yeah or

2637
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:47,439
I'm sorry those those less tense colas

2638
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,079
are less spy yeah well and it it leads

2639
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:50,559
to that open bud structure the stuff

2640
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:51,960
with the really open bud structure does

2641
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,159
a lot better typically in humid

2642
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,840
environments that's why these equat oral

2643
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:59,238
varieties and these tropical varieties

2644
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:02,760
with open bud structure yep do so well

2645
01:33:59,238 --> 01:34:04,519
like a pineapple chunk yeah yeah yeah

2646
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,000
that's Co a lot of the old stuff's

2647
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,800
comeing back man a lot of sour getting

2648
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,800
bred back in Blue Diamond like you're

2649
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:12,800
hearing some stuff they D so like when

2650
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,679
they started going with the extraction

2651
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,279
you know I mean they were doing the GMO

2652
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:18,279
and it was dumping and then the Donnie

2653
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:21,079
burgers and all why they so hard I like

2654
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:22,880
GMO a flower I I I I was a little baffel

2655
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:24,479
why they went so hard towards cuz you

2656
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,239
can really stress

2657
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,399
get it get it to dump you can get it to

2658
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:29,759
dump heavy right so it's a heavy dumper

2659
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:31,198
and then like the Donnie Burger I don't

2660
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,679
like the Donnie Burger flower so much

2661
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,118
it's not my choice like when I I won't

2662
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:37,639
smoke the rest of a bag if somebody

2663
01:34:35,118 --> 01:34:40,279
gives me some Flor and Flame shout out

2664
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:42,079
but uh when he turned it into extract

2665
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:43,920
and I got to try the Donnie B he gave me

2666
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:45,359
two grams or three grams of it and I

2667
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,079
brought him it was a reggae we were at

2668
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,359
reg on the river together and I had the

2669
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:51,039
Don Burger that's that's yeah we were

2670
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:52,639
smoking we were smoking with a little

2671
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:56,760
dipper yeah and we were trying that Flor

2672
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:59,159
of flame and that is amazing I love the

2673
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:00,800
effect and it's super smooth it has this

2674
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:03,319
little floral hint and it has this

2675
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,760
sweetness to it and it's it's special it

2676
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:06,799
is you know and it's different than GMO

2677
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:09,039
but I could taste the GMO in it I love

2678
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,560
GMO man that's when I'm surprised didn't

2679
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:11,800
have more time in the Limelight I have

2680
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,800
to tell you like there's a there was a

2681
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,279
few over the years and everyone beats up

2682
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,480
runs and Skittles you know because they

2683
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:18,079
definitely got played but like there's

2684
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:20,718
some like GMO where I'm like what's up

2685
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:23,198
or even like skitt keeps coming back

2686
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:28,760
Skittles that kind of that like garlic

2687
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:30,719
funk rank dank you know GMO TP

2688
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,960
it's but it's such an overwhelming

2689
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:35,480
tpping profile it's not as easy to play

2690
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,840
with as a skittles that kind of say with

2691
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:40,718
tping it's much easier to mix and match

2692
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:42,520
that yeah yeah yeah and I mean I love

2693
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,560
the papayas they're doing with extract

2694
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,600
now and some of these these Wild Ones

2695
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,320
it's like uh you know but I still love

2696
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:50,480
Skittles so like you give me a good

2697
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:52,238
Skittles rosin I'm like I'm all about it

2698
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:53,678
it's sweet to the nose man it is tough

2699
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:55,399
to your point it's it's an all-around

2700
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:57,000
winter and you know again I think it got

2701
01:35:55,399 --> 01:35:58,638
played a little bit on flower there's

2702
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,359
there again there was just there were

2703
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:03,800
such great man the 2010s especially like

2704
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:06,079
I respect the 2000 but the 2010 so much

2705
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:08,279
stuff that really got some serious play

2706
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:10,359
versus just I feel like it's been cycled

2707
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:12,800
so quick in and out but I bet you we'll

2708
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:14,719
be back here in five years and like I'll

2709
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:18,320
be talking about like man like what I

2710
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:21,079
would pay for like a Primo tops you know

2711
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:22,759
a [ __ ] you know pack of you know like

2712
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:24,319
I think liol I've been loving his

2716
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:30,759
Skittles keeps coming back though which

2717
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:32,279
i' I've seen where it goes away for a

2718
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,719
little bit then comes back and then

2719
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:37,399

2720
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:39,000
being super high for Skittles you know

2721

be bringing loud seeds and partnering

2796
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:15,960

2797
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000

2798
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,880

2799
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,679

2800
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,239
Tim from can Organics Okay so Andrew and

2801
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,800
I have been really tight and and done

2802
01:39:25,238 --> 01:39:28,399
some really cool stuff in Fallbrook we

2803
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:31,159
were working down at Fallbrook together

2804
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:32,879
yeah they he had a farm a hemp farm and

2805
01:39:31,158 --> 01:39:35,000
so yeah it's it's funny how small the

2806
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,279
world is and how the guy everybody works

2807
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,920
together at the top I think there's a

2808
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:41,279
lot of collaboration going on and not

2809
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,599
not as much hate no for sure because

2810
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:43,840
most of the Smart Ones what we talked

2811
01:39:42,599 --> 01:39:45,440
about earlier a lot of the bad apples

2812
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,119
got we you know kind of pushed out of

2813
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:49,399
the bunch you know especially I think in

2814
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:51,598
the mid late te up till now yeah like

2815
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:55,319
it's kind strongest they'll search back

2816
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:55,319
in well you know

2817
01:39:56,279 --> 01:40:00,639
yeah I mean I've seen that happen too

2818
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:02,920
like how did you get back in the IND

2819
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:04,679
like dude you're like a bad Penny yeah

2820
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,440
what exactly do you say that you do for

2821
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:08,279
this

2822
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:10,158
community I feel like I've seen people

2823
01:40:08,279 --> 01:40:13,158
make mistakes and I've seen people come

2824
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:14,559
back a better person yes so I've seen

2825
01:40:13,158 --> 01:40:16,559
that I've seen people make some silly

2826
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,639
mistakes and come back in the industry

2827
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,080
you know like yeah and apologize about

2828
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:21,239
it which I've been very there's a few

2829
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:23,118
that have been like sorry it was a

2830
01:40:21,238 --> 01:40:24,000
douche I'm like you know you figured it

2831
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:25,439
out

2832
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,238
how you're coming to Jesus I think we're

2833
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,079
talking about the same

2834
01:40:27,238 --> 01:40:31,919
person but you know it's small world

2835
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:33,960
small small it's funny how that works

2836
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,560
out you know and but this is such a

2837
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,960
community and we're very tight-knit and

2838
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,080
everybody kind of knows everybody so

2839
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:42,439
everyone knows all the [ __ ] Y and

2840
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:44,960
when you burn people especially it gets

2841
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:46,198
passed around real quick like nobody's

2842
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,920
business man and that's why I tell

2843
01:40:46,198 --> 01:40:50,238
people again speaking up on stage I'm

2844
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,399
like this is very unique because every

2845
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:54,799
industry start out as a community rather

2846
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,198
be real estate Automotive banking

2847
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,520
whatever it doesn't matter all start out

2848
01:40:56,198 --> 01:40:59,279
as a community of individuals are trying

2849
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,480
to solve a problem like like you guys

2850
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,960
like we can bring a solution right and

2851
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:05,759
that's the thing is this is still being

2852
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:08,118
led by the community this is not a

2853
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,800
corporate one industry if you will

2854
01:41:08,118 --> 01:41:12,079
especially not on the global scale

2855
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:13,760
surprisingly I mean there's 53 legal

2856
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:15,479
countries around the world and a lot of

2857
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,320
Americans don't know that so when we go

2858
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:20,319
to places like Thailand or Australia or

2859
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:22,198
or Argentina or wherever we're going

2860
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:23,279
around the world like it's interesting

2861
01:41:22,198 --> 01:41:24,839
because they take a different approach

2862
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:26,679
Ro towards it and a lot of them can

2863
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,360
balance that Community incorporate they

2864
01:41:26,679 --> 01:41:29,599
can we're here for the right reasons we

2865
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:31,319
have our heart in the right place but we

2866
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:33,199
want to do it very professionally and

2867
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:35,279
very structured and it goes back to the

2868
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:37,598
Sops and all these other standards you

2869
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:41,079
know right so but it's definitely we've

2870
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:42,599
