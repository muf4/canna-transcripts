same Circle and just different sides of

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,920
it yeah exactly yeah we probably even

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,679
were in the same room at one point I'm

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,640
sure probably yeah seriously and uh we

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,600
both like uh Sour Diesel yeah yeah sour

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
d y that's actually uh I think that's

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,198
how I met Josh really is I want to say

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,160
initially was picking up sour yeah and

24
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,759
then and then when he he was out he

25
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,839
needed more sour so and I was growing

26
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,799
more sour so then I ended up supplying

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,760
them sour it was it was really actually

28
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,238
for me it's it's you know we wouldn't

29
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,320
say it right then but it was chem dog

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,478
you know I mean it was getting the chem

31
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,239
the chem 91s chem 4S you're calling it

32
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,200
chem dog even though it sour calling it

33
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,640
sour they were yeah they were sour

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
passing is kind of how would say you

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,920
know we were I was I'd be honest you

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
know with Josh and let him know what's

37
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,079
up and all that but you know as long as

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,359
they had the good noes that was all what

39
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,239
was all about he used to grow the best

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,319
sour yeah that I remember yeah um you

41
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,599
know his his outs and his depths of sour

42
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,000
were sticky I know like Sticky Sticky

43
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,719
Buds you just don't see stuff like that

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
well that dead pass is indoor I mean

45
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,798
yeah well he sold it for more than

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,799
indoor like

47
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,118
even knowing it was depth you're like it

48
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,600
you didn't care because it was so loud

49
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,879
and you open the bag up it would hit you

50
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,078
in the face you know I love that that's

51
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:46,438
what's up for sure yeah I miss those

52
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:48,639
days especially somoma cazadero Menino

53
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,118
back then they were just it was at its

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,560
peak I think yeah and not that they're

55
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,599
not peeking now in their own ways but

56
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,359
like back then like the Cannabis scene

57
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,718
really peaked up there yep Sebastapol

58
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:01,200
yeah for sebasol to ocidental Sebastapol

59
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,919
Santa Rosa all those place there was

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,640
great flower going around uh late 90s

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,840
early 2000s even before that but like

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,280
man the the flower was great back then

63
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,080
yeah it was yeah how did you get your

64
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,598
start in the industry feel like I grew

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,920
up in the in the subculture this it's

66
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,280
kind of just part of my life you know

67
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,919
you kind of have no choice but to be in

68
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,360
it almost it felt like at at the moment

69
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,518
um just because it's like a big part of

70
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,040
like your circle my my my dad grew um I

71
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,480
was just around cannabis all the time so

72
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,799
um but I I've kind of had um kind of

73
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,679
kind of went more towards like my

74
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,360
natural my natural abilities was like

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,120
sales you know and just combining like

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,080
my love for cannabis and like my

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,759
community and having access I think is

78
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,040
probably a big reason yeah it's kind I

79
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,560
think probably the number one reason why

80
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,280
I got into it is just like you were

81
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,840
saying some of the best cannabis I think

82
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,640
um especially especially back then that

83
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,878
anyone had ever seen you know in the

84
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,799
world or in the United States they

85
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:56,679
obviously there's some stuff that's

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,120
comparable in the world but um coming

87
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,719
out of Menino humbal obviously there's a

88
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,200
lot of humble root

89
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,479
um the Bay Area I mean it just goes on

90
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,639
triangle Bay Area right place right time

91
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,959
I guess is I guess is what I'm trying to

92
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,598
say yeah we were blessed to be in that

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,959
place at that time that's really what it

94
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,839
is for sure yeah cuz I mean uh you know

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,200
it's funny it's to say I'm 40 years old

96
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,000
and to say I've been in it for 20 years

97
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,119
is kind of ridiculous you know more than

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
20 years I'm 47 you're 47 47 I feel you

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,439
yeah you know there's not a lot of

100
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,760
professions you can be this age and say

101
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,519
you've been in it that long you know you

102
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,639
know just to you know it's it's pretty

103
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,719
amazing we talk about are 18-year-old

104
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,039
selves a lot of this show like you know

105
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,719
I think there's only two people that you

106
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,639
really want to impress that's your 18yar

107
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,598
old self and your 80-year old self and I

108
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,479
think most of the people in this

109
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,000
industry you know their 18year old

110
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,119
selves would be pretty stoked yeah yeah

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,318
yeah so I know I know my 18y old self

112
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,319
would be like right on that's pretty

113
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:51,438
[ __ ] cool yeah it's pretty magical

114
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:52,719
honestly I owe a lot to cannabis yeah

115
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:54,359
yeah it's it's brought a lot for me I've

116
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,158
had some hard times you know and the

117
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,799
Transitions and and trials and

118
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:58,959
tribulations that I think pretty much

119
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,079
everyone has gone through especially if

120
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
they've been in it for last couple

121
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,840
decades yeah um but I wouldn't trade it

122
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,400
for the world yeah totally and you've

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,239
done all kinds of stuff in the industry

124
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,200
I mean besides the products you have now

125

172
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,319
started helping them hire and train

173
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,759
there that's that's kind of got started

174
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,560
in the industry a little bit there at

175
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,879
Sant Hydro helped them uh find some

176
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,240
people um train some of their staff

177
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,800
helped with them purchasing like letting

178
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,038
them know hey you need these supplements

179
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,639
you need these you know these additives

180
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,240
um uh you know this is how you know this

181
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,519
is ready grow Coco you know this is how

182
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,360
Coco works because not a lot of people

183
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,240
were rocking it as as strong back then I

184
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
hated Coco back in the day where you

185
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,840
have to get the blocks oh the yeah yeah

186
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,399
yeah all that you put him in a kitty

187
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,719
pool and you got that's why ready grow

188
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,079
was like kind of a big thing back then

189
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,240
you know from Botanica obviously um

190
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,279
there's a lot of other companies that

191
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
make U just as good or better products

192
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,399
than than that but at that time it was

193
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,198
revolutionary to have something premixed

194
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,478
and ready to go and stuff but it still

195
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,160
required a lot of CM mag right you know

196
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,879
totally which was really really

197
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,759
beneficial for Botanicare but anyways

198
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,159
long story short I'll try on that side

199
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,680
was is that I they finally got opened up

200
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,039
a bigger facility you know and I was

201
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,079
rolling through with cards and TG the

202
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,719
founder of was there at the shop and he

203
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:34,800
had never seen such a large array of

204
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
their products you know usually when

205
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
they go in the shops it's just the Heavy

206
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
Hitters yeah but I was getting really

207
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
into the nitty-gritty all their cool

208
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,680
little supplements they had you know

209
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,919
clex and organic hairline and yeah all

210
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,000
these things uh humic and fulvic and and

211
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,519
uh kind of messing with those different

212
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,680
things and so they saw it it looked

213
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,598
really nice and it was really stocked

214
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,439
and then they saw me rolling through

215
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:53,918
with the big carts yeah he's all get

216
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,800
that guy's number you know I want to

217
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,799
talk to him yeah initially I didn't I

218
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,439
didn't want to stop growing really so I

219
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
wasn't you know I was didn't have time

220
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,160
and I was making good you know making

221
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,000
making good let's just say right with

222
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
growing so um they asked me to work for

223
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,879
them but instead what I did is I did

224
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,399
some development beta testing with them

225
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,120
um and actually help create a three-part

226
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,120
nutrient system we had we had like eight

227
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
bottles come in all white label and um

228
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,680
and we broke them all the way down to

229
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,559
just three parts it's called kind it's a

230
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,160
three-part nutrient system oh yeah the

231
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,280
goal was the goal was is to not have to

232
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,039
not require calmag yeah and if you think

233
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,359
about it this like Botanicare most

234
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,918
famous product that's literally used

235
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,120
with GH it's used with Advanced

236
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,318
Nutrients at that time especially was

237
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,360
their Cal Mag it was botan's Cal Mag

238
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,160
sure so then he's like well you know

239
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

240
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,199
make a three-part that doesn't require C

241
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,038
mag so it's kind of it's a very very

242
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,800
creative idea yeah and so Grilla was

243
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,839
sold to Botanicare was that before after

244
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,360
no I brokered that you're the one who

245
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,918
brokered it yeah yeah oh that's awesome

246
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,158
yeah I was yeah so I had so I had my

247
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,000
indoor Ops and then I had the um depths

248
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:57,319
and the outdoors you know and all those

249
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,759
and those uh Josh Josh really turned me

250
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,400
on to the top tress totally and all that

251
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,280
that stuff is great it's a lifesaver

252
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,359
really I mean just if you need to leave

253
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,478
and you got you're relying on somebody

254
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,800
that doesn't know what they're doing you

255
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:09,240
tell them okay look you lay it all down

256
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,720
and just water you know what I mean we'

257
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,240
scratch in a little bit you know

258
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,400

from everybody else pretty much like if

312
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,639
his Durban is the real Durban I've seen

313
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,720
it for a handful of times but most of

314
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,679
the Durban that's going around is very

315
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,639
like super silver I mean I haven't even

00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,439
for years yeah I mean I've seen Durban

318
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,200

like super silver haze than did like

320
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,240

324
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:32,240
takes it takes long to grow too yeah

325
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,959
yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean if you if you

326
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,159
push it you know but I mean you get

327
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,679
Monster Monster Co yeah to trade-off is

328
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,000
yield yeah for sure it looks awesome

329
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,679
indoors it's also kind of hairy yeah I I

330
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,039
remember it being a little dark too yeah

331
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,319
yeah yeah yeah and there's it's

332
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,480
interesting all the different bag appeal

333
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,000
things that happened over time that's

334
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,360
changed you know I remember going from

335
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,879
uh you want it to be bright and limey

336
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,480
you know to purple and then then not

337
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,360
purple you couldn't sell purple to save

338
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,680
your life purple was super unpopular

339
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,800
yeah there was like the yeah purple orle

340
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,000
GDP and all of a sudden yeah yeah super

341
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,559
purple purple yeah and there was like

342
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,799
good meno perss and all that stuff and

343
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,399
it was really popular and then one day

344
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,479
nobody wanted purple you couldn't sell

345
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,039
it to save your life yeah it was like

346
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,399
you you got to go to Richmond to sell

347
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,639
purple or wherever like there was a

348
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,159
couple places you could probably still

349
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,159
move it it definitely didn't want in La

350
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,958
the Bay Area was very picky and I think

351
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,078
OG and sour pretty much took over right

352
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,000
right then right is thatt is that the

353
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:28,399
right I think for sure yeah so and it

354
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,799
was all everyone wanted OG I have I have

355
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,320
a theory about that about the OG and

356
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,719
sour popularity thing is it's very

357
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,560
different than what we're doing with now

358
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,320
is that it was actually really hard to

359
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,159
grow it was actually hard to get it to

360
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,519
come out really good yeah you know and

361
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,799
that if you got really good OG or really

362
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,000
good sour like good Strong Nose right

363
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,759
you know it's it's full potential you

364
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
were the [ __ ] and you had the [ __ ] yeah

365
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,679
you know it's not everybody could do

366
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,919
that you know and so I think that that

367
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,599
had some play in it well and I don't

368
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,479
honestly think that they perform as well

369
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,759
under LEDs as they do perform under HPS

370
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,039
or c or combination of the two that's

371
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,838
just my two sents I've heard from you

372
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:08,278
know Brian and vital some of the stuff

373
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,480
those guys D the C is the the ticket

374
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,879
I've heard from some people other I like

375
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,320
HPS still yeah I like HPS flow I like

376
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,639
smoking HPS I like the turps yeah not

377
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,480
there's anything wrong with LED I think

378
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,759
it works for a lot especially the purple

379
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,759
stuff candy stuff I think that it works

380
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,439
well for that but you know it's just

381
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,319
it's a personal preference to but I

382
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,440
don't see a lot of good OG now you know

383
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,560
we don't really see it uh and it is it

384
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,079
is hard to grow s OG I've seen to this

385
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,078
day has always been light dep or been

386
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,319
light you know growing yeah not full

387
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,278
outdoor but like you know full sun depth

388
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,199
not light assist I mean I see some good

389
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,879
Doc O coming from Humble still like

390
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:44,719
there's some good Doc O packs that I've

391
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,679
seen that are that you know from their

392
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,278
friends grow that are like on that on

393
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,399
that on that point though really it's

394
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,240
chem 91 that I like the most like like I

395
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,240
mean in that realm you it's the most

396
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,198
nostalgic for me it's the most nostalgic

397
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,240
I like it it's it's subtle but it is

398
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:01,599
like burnt tires like chem 91 has that

399
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,519
burnt Tire appeal and if you love it you

400
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,800
love it see yeah it's anti- candy really

401
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,480
almost yeah it's totally anti- candy and

402
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:11,958
it's not like GMO or chmd because K GMO

403
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,159
comes from chmd and that's kind of like

404
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,599
it has that burnt Tire still but it's

405
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,919
different yeah yeah or just subtle

406
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,680
subtly yeah yeah and the chem 91 was

407
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:25,919
different than OG OG's very like earthy

408
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:28,039
and piny and citrusy and chem 91 it has

409
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,958
earthiness it you know I wouldn't say

410
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,759
it's necessarily really citrusy even

411
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,518
though there's Citrus in it yeah yeah it

412
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,799
is it's pungent yeah it's its own thing

413
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,480
um I like to see learn more see see more

414
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,679
come out about the the chps on the chem

415
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,519
91 yeah be cool yeah I like chem 91 I

416
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,838
like sour those are those are good and

417
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,799
they're coming back yeah they are yeah

418
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,360
they're yeah they're they're making

419
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,919
their comeback it's really like about

420
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,959
you know the right ones you know yeah

421
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,278
but we'll see but there's there's some

422
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,919
arguments sometimes about that over the

423
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:56,000
years yeah as people say they're you

424
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,519
know their OG right is the OG you know

425
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,639
or their sour is the sour that's that's

426
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,240
always been that's always been since the

427
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,720
beginning of those things early early on

428
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,480
and there's been a lot of like it's

429
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,560
whatever New York wanted really is what

430
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,920
exactly ended up being the but yeah that

431
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,719
gas there's something special about it

432
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,719
and you know gas is taken on its own

433
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,399
life we had like the GMOs and then the

434
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,079
Donnie burgers and you know then they've

435
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,399
evolved into the double burger or

436
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,278
whatever like and those those wash

437
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:28,120
really well but uh you know and but

438
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:29,600
that's still not m91 it's very different

439
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,278
so a lot of people when they you know

440
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,278
especially the younger generation they

441
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,320
relate to gas more of like that GMO I

442
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,600
mean gorilla Gorilla Glue that's another

443
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,000
one that took over I brought Gorilla

444
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,720
Glue up from from the cup in LA in

445
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,720
200000 that's another one that's changed

446
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,759
that changed pretty quickly 2013 though

447
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,040
it w it won the cup there and they gave

448
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,720
out clones to everybody it was the

449
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,399
smartest move it was the exact opposite

450
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,199
of whatever we thought we were supposed

451
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,839
to be doing with genetics we're like

452
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,078
close it promoted it it blew up you need

453
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,720
you needed to share it it needed to get

454
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,439
around people needed to talk about it

455
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,040
yeah and they they so freely gave it to

456
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,399
everybody it it was yeah rest in peace

457
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,240
Jessie whales yeah you know actually the

458
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,198
first time I was introduced to it was in

459
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,159
um actually at going into botan meetings

460
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:17,799
from uh Doug Mar do you know Doug marman

461
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,600
at all in Colorado I know who he is yeah

462
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:20,758
he actually gave me he actually brought

463
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,519
we kind of we would all we would do that

464
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,079
because we came from all different spots

465
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,799
States we do our our Botanicare meeting

466
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,799
we all brought our buds you know nice

467
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,359
and he he had his a nice Gorilla Glue

468
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,919
yeah I remember when Josh switched over

469
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:38,240
from sour to uh to glue it was so when

470
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:40,919
it gorilla so yeah it was in high demand

471
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,000
the silver silver back Grilla

472
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,360
yeah but yeah and and then his hair

473
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,440
turned gray yeah that's perfect time but

474
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,879
yeah so when I remember I gave cuts to

475
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,040
him and my friend Joe and a couple other

476
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,399
people that IID got from the cup and it

477
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,599
was that year other people too because

478
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,399
they gave him out so freely it really

479
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
spread like wildfire it went from

480
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,958
everybody growing sour to everybody

481
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,759
growing Gorilla Glue within one season

482
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,958
because it finished faster it New York

483
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,759
you rem that reminds me of something

484
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,359
blackberry kush blackberry kush is a

485
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,039
similar phenomenon it was it was you

486
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,278
know it was like that that no matter

487
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,278
what it looked good no matter what it

488
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,679
looked so good and outdoor it performed

489
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,720
well and it came dark yeah but it was

490
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,159
low THC yeah but you could dep it too it

491
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,199
would it would look like indoor for sure

492
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,799
it looked yeah it looked like straight

493
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:24,039
indoor yeah you couldn't tell there's

494
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:25,958
probably today you probably still tell

495
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,399
most people couldn't tell yeah for sure

496
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,719
yeah it was a good one I actually ran

497
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,000
that and did pretty well with Blackberry

498
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Cush yeah yeah I liked it you know I

499
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,958
like the TPS but it was just never like

500
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,040
a strong well that's what everyone

501
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,318
complained they called it like like F's

502
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,198
gold or something you know people were

503
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,399
complaining about yeah but there's now

504
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,838
there's different you know philosophies

505
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,519
on you know what kind of different kinds

506
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,199
of feelings you know cannabis should

507
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,480
give you and sure and all that so maybe

508
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,240
it's something that could get come back

509
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,879
around again you know and people I think

510
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,480
for flavor and I think it's been breed

511
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,958
into a lot of things it has yeah yeah

512
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,079
for sure because I'm I crossed it a

513
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,359
little bit I mean I'm not you know I'm

514
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:58,479
not going to come on here and say I'm a

515
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,318
breeder you know officially but I I've

516
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,680
played around like a hobby nice you know

517
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,838
and I've crossed it with sour and things

518
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,438
like that dude that's what it's all

519
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,120
about my book is basically all about

520
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,079
that for hobbyists to I ordered I

521
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,639
ordered I ordered a book I saw that yeah

522
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:13,000
I think I reposted your uh your reel oh

523
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,199
yeah nice dude but yeah thank you very

524
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,880
much look for to it's it was an

525
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,640
adventure writing the book but yeah it's

526
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,720
it's for everybody and it's like it's

527
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,559
great being able to put all the

528
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,318
information you know Greg green did it

529
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,639
25 years ago but there hasn't been

530
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,438
anything since really yeah so I'm happy

531
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,440
to put a book on the market that I think

532
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,160
is a great you know resource for

533
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,440
information about breathing for because

534
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,640
I I think everybody should breed

535
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,600
honestly it's it's so fun if you're a

536
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,840
good girl or you should breed if you're

537
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,240
not a good girl you should learn how to

538
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,558
grow better yeah um but at the end of

539
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,200
the day because the pheno hunting is

540
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,519
where you actually see the difference in

541
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,160
the plants and if you don't grow them

542
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,879
well enough to have them Express it's

543
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
really hard saying this one's better

544
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,480
than this one this one's better than

545
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,200
this one and vice versa if you line them

546
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,759
up 10 at a time and you're not growing

547
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,440
them while it's kind of tough yeah and I

548
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,119
and I still find people um that out

549
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,840
there travel to the United States I do I

550
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,759
do uh speaking gigs and stuff for

551
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,959
conventions and stuff yeah and um you

552
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,879
know you meet a lot of people that are

553
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,679
just getting into it all and they don't

554
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,320
realize the some of the complexities

555
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,840
there are in youo hunting and and

556
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,439
keeping track of those and making sure

557
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,240
that you you know you keep the ones that

558
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
you want and yeah you know taking it all

559
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,679
the way to flower just to find out which

560
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,720
one is good and which one's bad and

561
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,360
there's a lot involved for sure I have a

562
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,279
lot of respect for people who are are in

563
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,279
it like like yourself you know it's lots

564
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,440
of fun and the thing is is like the

565
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,558
amount of genetic diversity varies from

566
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,320
one plant to the next and so you have

567
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,599
something like Blue Dream you make it S1

568
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,200
of Blue Dream and you basically get four

569
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,038
Expressions if you have the real Santa

570
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,400
Cruz Blue Dream cut but then you take

571
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,240
something like gelato 33 and you pop

572
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,559
seeds in every single expression is

573
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,120
different yeah you know where where you

574
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:50,000
you see the flower of it the way they

575
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,879
grow there's so much uh diversity but

576
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
then on the same note you have something

577
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,919
like gelato 41 and it has a lot more

578
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,200
stability than than the 33 and that came

579
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,360
from you know like I said it gives it a

580
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,519
lot of commercial viability for sure

581
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,119
yeah I mean it has and blue dream's cool

582
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,558
it's it's easy to grow I I think there's

583
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,119
a lot of people that hate on it for

584
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:10,319
whatever reason well I think that go

585
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,239
ties into that thing I was telling you

586
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,200
about like OG and sour being kind of

587
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,200
hard and where blue dream was easy so

588
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,279
blue dream kind of got ripped on you

589
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,960
know it's not that it was bad bad weed

590
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,079
totally yeah I well I think the high the

591
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,880
effect some people want that

592
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,839
like strong narcotic effect and other

593
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,400
people want the uplifting and then some

594
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,798
people want like through the roof Durban

595
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,559
that you know most people can't handle

596
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,400
because their heartbeats too fast yeah

597
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,038
yeah there are different types of people

598
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,798
like people have different react

599
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,319
differently too for sure we've been

600
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,519
seeing that well our body chemistries

601
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,678
are all so different that it affects us

602
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,798
different and then taste and flavor is

603
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,840
so subjective so is effect yeah so

604
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,079
that's true with wine too I see I see

605
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,319
that with wine you know you got the they

606
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,000
got the smell they're like you know

607
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,399
putting all the the hints in your in

608
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,759
your ear about what what you're tasting

609
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,240
and totally sure enough it starts

610
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,319
appearing it's like magic all of a

611
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,038
sudden butter I taste the butter and the

612
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:06,678
chocolate yeah well same thing with

613
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:09,558
cigars so cigars is a tough one cuz like

614
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,880
and after getting a bunch of data points

615
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:15,079
you realize what's what and cigar but

616
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,520
cigars are so strong it's you're looking

617
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:18,639
for the subtleties and the subtleties

618
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,879
are there but you have to experience it

619
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
enough just like with cannabis I think

620
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,799
the average person looks at weed and

621
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,919
they're like oh that's weed but after

622
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:27,400
you've tried 50 different things or 100

623
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,280
different things or a thousand different

624
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
things you have a real different opinion

625
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,240
of it yeah you know and that goes along

626
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,000
with growing too it's it's as basic or

627
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,440
as complex as you want to make it yeah

628
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,759
they're all they're very there's a lot

629
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,240
of uh parallels with uh tobacco yeah uh

630
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,679
cannabis and wine you know alcohol in

631
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,880
general yeah you know I I think tobacco

632
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,840
is one of those things that gets kind of

633
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,720
overlooked a lot I mean obviously

634
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,959
there's the cigar industry yeah but like

635
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,798
you know the tobacco plant and all that

636
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,720
I actually grow tobacco nice and I have

637
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:54,960
I have I have seeds and some some

638
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,640
crosses and stuff when I grow out a home

639
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,919
and you know there's little tobacco buds

640
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,720
I don't know if you've seen it is for

641
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,240
you yeah oh yeah yeah take that out of

642
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,360
the

643
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,599
podcast I just mean I'm my own little

644
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:10,599
hom grow I'm not promoting a tobacco

645

and Stuff tobacco is really cool it's I

651
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,119
know I have you know I think it's saer

652
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,278
that you could have a lot more respect

653
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,038
for it it's been kind of bastardized

654
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:27,359
like you're saying yeah you know when

655
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:28,599
we're talking about lung cancer and

656
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,359
other things I mean they've proven that

657
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,480
tobacco can cause lung cancer with

658
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,240
cigarettes but like I think from a

659
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,759
sacred and medicinal standal thank you

660
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,839

as a as a pest control thing too in some

662
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,879

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,640
actually took one of those while sitting

691
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,798
on a balcony thing like a edge you know

692
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,759
on a at an apartment oh no and I almost

693
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,519
fell over fell off I bet those will get

694
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,960
you yeah I got pretty sick on them a

695
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,480
couple times to it was enough for me to

696
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,038
stop doing them I was like a I mean that

697
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,720
was years ago many many years ago well

698
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,960
there's a guy named Paul Che and Paul

699
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,558
Che uses the volcano and he vaporizes

700
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,159
Tob I think he vaporiz other stuff too

701
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,839
but he vaporizes tobacco yeah for

702
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,960
concentration and so he does a lot of

703
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,399
writing and stuff that he's he's one of

704
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,600
the people I look up to like I said I

705
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,880
still respect these things they get they

706
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,158
get kind of blown out of proportion in

707
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,080
her bastard sometimes you know like

708
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,799
you're saying like natural form it's not

709
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,798
a bad thing yeah exactly yeah so and it

710
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:14,240
can be used responsibly and I think you

711
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,440
know you're talking about something

712
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,919
where there's no combustion he's he's uh

713
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,000
vaporizing it I think that's a probably

714
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,720
a safer and smar way and if it helps

715
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,319
with concentration he's a great writer

716
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,960
he's also you know uh he does sports

717
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,879
medicine and stuff like that so it's

718
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,079
it's pretty amazing stuff do that's

719
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,200

730
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,360
catchmaster nice yeah well let's dive

731
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,798
into catchmaster because uh your name is

732
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:01,038
catchmaster Alex on Instagram I've taken

733

a lot of ownership over this project um

734
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,119
you know it's a bigger company than me I

735
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,278
think a lot of initially a lot of people

736
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,000
I think they go you know that is my

737
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,759
company you know yeah but that's the

738
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,240
that's the way I I take pride in it and

739
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:15,000
I carry in it um when these guys

740
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,720
approached me they came to me and um

741
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,359
presented the idea of bringing them into

742
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,038
the Growers industry they were actually

743
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,759
called Atlantic past and glue company

744
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,519
and they have they do have a brand

745
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,679
called catchmaster that's um for the

746
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,879
professional pest pest world and they

747
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,278
they primarily made like uh like rat

748
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,880
glue trap

749
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,038
and and they made they made the yellow

750
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
sticky traps and all those kind of

751
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,720
things but they never really put any

752
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,798
hyperfocus on The Growers industry and

753
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,000
The Growers Market they did a lot of uh

754
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:40,519
they work you know work with some pretty

755
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,440
big companies like Terminex and orcin

756
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,240
and stuff yeah um and they're American

757
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,519
American company family-owned company

758
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,399
yeah um initially they're kind of

759
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,440
pitching it to me I was just like no no

760
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:52,759
like because I'm I'm a nutrient

761
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,320
fertilizer uh guy you know like all that

762
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,119
kind of stuff just uh the the Grower's

763
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,079
world you know almost never really

764
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,599
thought twice about the sticky trap you

765
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,839
know snecker TR just like but it's in

766
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,038
every grow room and it's always been

767
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,439
there right you know what I mean and

768
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,359
they really started breaking down to me

769
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,159
like like how what their perspective on

770
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,639
it is like the the professional way of

771
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,960
utilizing them as pest monitors we

772
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,200
always called them pest traps you know

773
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,319
and people are kind of half-hazard

774
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,679
hanging them in the Grow rooms and then

775
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,798
they're just spraying you know and all

776
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,679
these kind of things I mean there's a

777
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,679
lot of Growers for a long time that just

778
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,440
kind of saw [ __ ] and they sprayed right

779
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,360
yeah um and then they put the traps up

780
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,759
to control Nets that's kind of been the

781
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,918
emo for sure so that was to all honesty

782
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,398
that was my P my interpretation of what

783
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,360
a sticky trap was for it was just soil

784
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,759
Nets soil Nets right and then when they

785
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:39,240
started breaking down the the science of

786
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,919
it and all that I you know I started

787
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,880
studying uh you know I'm working on my

788
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,919
degree right now in sustainable

789
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,919
agriculture oh wow I'm I'm I'm taking a

790
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,159
lot of it really really got me going it

791
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,480
got me kind of more excited because it's

792
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,880
something outside of what I've been

793
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,120
doing all these years which is like like

794

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,120
um before that um there really wasn't a

808
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,200
you know there wasn't a clear concise

809
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:26,439
message about like how to use it so at

810
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,880
first I was like like there's no way I'm

811
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,600
going to go down this path you know I'm

812
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,520
going working three years now working

813
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,879
with these guys and on this project um

814
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,599
and uh the sky's a limit for me I really

815
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,080
I see so much more Improvement for

816
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,599
integrated Pest Management and protocols

817
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,519
for cannabis industry yeah there's

818
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,599
people who have their Sops and have

819
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,879
their protocols I'm not going to go

820
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,158
around telling people to change their

821
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,440
Sops necessarily but there's just a few

822
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,000
little tweaks and few things that the

823
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,960
professionals like the people who never

824
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,359
stepped stepped a foot in the in a

825
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
cannabis facility ever you know they

826
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,959
don't a lot of them won't even service

827
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,480
cannabis facilities you know these are

828
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,079
federally federally based companies

829
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,440
right you know but I got have a lot of

830
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,879
their information a lot of their

831
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,278
knowledge you know that you I think I

832
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,480
think the the biggest thing right now

833
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:10,640
for that side of things is having a

834
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,720
dedicated IPM manager is kind of a you

835
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,480
have you have a person who um that also

836
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,798
U you know does the cleaning of the of

837
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,558
the plants and cleaning of the room

838
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,200
things like that you have them also do a

839
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,918
good checking of the pest monitors

840
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,319
having the pest traps up actually having

841
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,880
monitoring for insects and seeing what

842
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,599
insects they have when they have them

843
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
where they have them that way can take

844
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,199
appropriate actions you know mhm and

845
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,720
this stuff I know you know yeah you know

846
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,798
but traveling around the United States

847
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,120
and all these Emerging Markets

848
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,879
everywhere um and there's a lot of

849
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,918
misinformation and so much

850
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,559
misinformation I would say when I first

851
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,360
started this I would say more than half

852
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,519
were doing it wrong yeah you know what

853
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,719
they're doing is they're they're

854
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,960
spraying like crazy you know and so and

855
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,839
that's okay I get it that's part of the

856
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,079
SOP and I'm not trying to tell people

857
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,759
stop spraying but the goal of IPM and

858
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,240
this might be controversial is to

859
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,000
eventually reduce or eliminate chemical

860
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,359
sprays or to reluce even maybe organic

861
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,759
sprays you know you want to get down to

862
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,639
the point where you pretty much aren't

863
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,919
doing any yeah and and that's not just

864
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,519
because of sticky traps sticky traps are

865
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,600
going to magically do that on their own

866
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,200
you got to do things like have good

867
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,278
genetics like yours yeah or you're doing

868
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,759
tissue culture uh they're tested they're

869
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,640
they're they're proven that's the first

870
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,119
thing right that's the first step that's

871
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,960
just the foundational step yeah I don't

872
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:19,918
think people fully wrap their heads

873
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,840
around how important that is yet yeah um

874
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
that's the only way they're going to get

875
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,158
to that next stage and and get to that

876
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,278
end goal which is to stop spraying

877
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,559
basically there's so many variables too

878
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,880
like you use soil what's coming in on

879
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,558
your soil yeah yeah exactly yeah that's

880
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,480
exact exactly right and then there's

881
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:38,240
cultural controls cultural controls I

882
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,000
mean humidity uh temperature um all

883
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,399
those things and then of course um like

884
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,398
we said sanitization and cleaniness all

885
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,918
those things so huge but in in the the

886
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,038
the middle of all of that the reason why

887
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,080
I'm so passionate about with catchmaster

888
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,398
is that it's to monitor the whole time

889
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,678
yeah there's not enough monitoring going

890
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,038
on in the industry you want to be

891
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,720
monitoring from the from when you get

892
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,359
the Clones you have you have your pest

893
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,000
monitor there and just pest monitor is a

894
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,918
sticky trap right but it's the

895
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,119
professional term you have it there and

896
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:06,080
you have it at the teen stage you have

897
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,719
it the the growing stage the flowering

898
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,398
stage you have different zones people

899
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,480
don't think about zones for a long time

900
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:12,918
people are just hanging them one one you

901
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,519
got to have one below the canopy you got

902
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,000
to have one near the medium yeah you

903
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,960
want to have one at or near the canopy

904
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,278
and one above the canopy as well and and

905
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,840
if you're in a greenhouse you want to

906
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,000
have up above in the way up there in the

907
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:26,240
peak you have like an agil rolled out

908
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,278
for mature insects you know and all

909
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,000
these things and have someone check

910
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,319
those things you know twice week yeah

911
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,720
you know and you know I'm probably

912
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,038
preaching to the choir but it's like you

913
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,440
know especially with you know what you

914
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,879
got going on with your brand is you know

915
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,200
your whole thing is having you know

916
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,559
clean good genetics you know but well

917
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,200
and if you're selling clones you're only

918
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:43,879
as good as your last clone so if you

919
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,640
give someone hop L and verid or whatever

920
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,320
new viruses out or you have tests those

921
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,320
are really big issues and that that uh

922
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,960
basically will uh you know that that'll

923
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,359
affect your brand especially over a long

924
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,519
period of time and people might buy your

925
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,959
stuff because you're popular or you're

926
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,720
you're you know the new hype guy yeah

927
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,000
but if you give them a virus right that

928
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,278
affects their bottom line fix their

929
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,558
wallet yeah see you you said it right

930
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,599
and that's actually the other aspect of

931
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,319
IPM too that I that I've been educating

932
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,879
people on is IPM even though it says

933
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,439
integrated Pest Management a good IPM

934
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,159
protocol or program or practices yeah is

935
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
about profitability and so and that's

936
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,480
why when you say reduceed pesticide

937
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,200
sprays well why can't I just keep

938
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,120
spraying well that cost you money for

939
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,840
one thing it cost money yeah and then

940
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,759
have mold and fungus viruses all these

941
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,720
things are going to affect yield um

942
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,158
spraying constantly could affect yield

943
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,839
there's a lot of reasons why you want to

944
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,919
have good good IPM good you know a good

945
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,000
protocol and actually follow it step by

946
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,679
step in that order at the very the very

947
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,398
last resort should be chemical spray to

948
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,360
be honest right that's your last resort

949
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,278
but um there's a certain point where it

950
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,959
always you has to happen in any industry

951
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:55,240
uh restaurants houses hotels throughout

952
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,880
agriculture there's there's a certain

953
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,839
point where you have infestations are

954
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,639
infestations and right sometimes there's

955
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,000
no choice well if you have a nursery I

956
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,240
mean there's protocols that you go

957
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,240
through and then same thing with your

958
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,638
flow it's but the less you spray the

959
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,359
better right you not only for your money

960
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:11,918
but for your plants yeah and you know I

961
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,759
think the controversial thing is that a

962
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,759
common sop is you spray this chemical

963
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,798
twice a week yeah you know that's the

964
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,839
that's like that that's to from from my

965
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,798
perspective from everything I've been

966
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,480
learning really what it is is you spray

967
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,839
when you see this particular insect

968
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,839
that's actually what it's supposed to be

969
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,599
supposed to be you have a monitor out

970
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:31,079
okay then you see a thrip and then how

971
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,638
manys per square does it trigger a

972
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,439
particular spray yeah and then that's

973
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:37,199
that's that's supposed to I mean in a

974
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,679
perfect world in a perfect world but I

975
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,278
think one of the problems with that is a

976
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:41,840
lot of people are lazy and they don't

977
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:43,359
have people going through the rooms

978
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,398
looking for problems yeah because if

979
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,879
you're very aware and it comes down to

980
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:50,199
awareness at a certain level it's like

981
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,600
how aware are you of exactly what's

982
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,480
going on in your room on a you know not

983
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:58,158
on a microscopic level but on a on a

984
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,919
pest level where you can identify I like

985
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,559
the word monitoring monitoring is super

986
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,759
important and and actually I I don't

987
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,359
want to forget to mention predatory

988
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,720
insects of course being a a great IPM uh

989
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,918
solution you know program part of a

990
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,679
program but that's another one where

991
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,880
people will just buy them those insects

992
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,440
out of the idea that they're going to

993
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,600
have mites or they're going to have

994
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,360
aphids you know there people are

995
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,359
actually releasing predatory insects

996
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,359
like as a PR pre uh preventative you

997
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,879
know measure and there's probably some

998
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,759
people in that industry that will

999
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,799
recommend that and that's you know you

1000
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:27,240
know I don't want to start fights over

1001
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,278
that or anything like that but I think

1002
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,440
it's it's more ideal to know what you

1003
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,759
have and when you have it and where you

1004
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,679
have it and what insects to release cuz

1005
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,679
again that's wasting money yeah and

1006
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,880
resources and time you might not have

1007
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,080
ever known that you actually had good

1008
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,360
genetics and they were clean and your

1009
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,000
you know your medium you know your

1010
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,599
medium was clean like you're were saying

1011
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,159
so on a 50 light room yeah how many

1012
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,480
traps do you need how do you break it

1013
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,120
down and and exactly where do you hang

1014
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,679
so that's the thing is I actually think

1015
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,759
of it as like plant plant count more so

1016
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,759
plant numbers um and I you know if you

1017
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,440
have planter beds it's a little

1018
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,879
different than if you have pots you know

1019
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,519
yeah um so with pots you know we're now

1020
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,840
this may sound funny because I I'm now

1021
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,120
selling siky traps so I'm be like put

1022
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,839
one with every plant right sure more

1023
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,678
mean but the you have plant tags so you

1024
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,278
technically could put one with right you

1025
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,000
can so I we now make um a a plant IDE we

1026
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:17,278
call it a dual action plant label yeah

1027
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,720
and that what that does is on one side

1028
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,398
you can you write the name of the plant

1029
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,880
or or or or or a date even yeah and then

1030
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:24,319
you turn it to whatever your protocol is

1031
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,200
for that and then the other side is

1032
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,240
actually a transfer paper that you peel

1033
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,720
and that will actually be your pest

1034
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,278
monitor of the coolest things I've seen

1035
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,919
this year yeah yeah for sure actually I

1036
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:33,119
have one out I can show you yeah let's

1037
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,240
go through some of your products yeah

1038
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,879
these are this is the plant label this

1039
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,960
is the newest thing um this is like pre

1040
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,679
pre-released essentially I've been

1041
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,960
showing just barely showing it around

1042
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,320
yeah um so here's your standard thing

1043
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,360
it's got to be a little thicker like a

1044
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,839
like a because it's going to stick in

1045
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,079
the medium right it's going to stick

1046
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,398
right in the rock wall or whatever and

1047
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:52,638
then you you write right on there this

1048
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,479
is completely dry no glue and then you

1049
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:55,759
have this nice transfer paper on here

1050
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,319
and the transfer paper is what protects

1051
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:58,480
the glue now you're going to think okay

1052
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:00,839
this is going to be sticky it's going to

1053
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,558
drip it's none of that happens um this

1054
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,720
the like I said this company's Atlantic

1055
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,678
past and glue company that that that's

1056
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,760
really behind catchmaster and they've

1057
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,480
been doing this since the 1950s and they

1058
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,040
have like these viscosities down it's

1059
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,559
non-toxic and um you can see it doesn't

1060
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,838
leave any residue on the finger at all

1061
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,279
yeah put it right on the skin doesn't

1062
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,440
pull your hair yeah goad touch it yeah I

1063
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,480
know people are scared sometimes but go

1064
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,838
ahead oh that's cool that's amazing yeah

1065
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,519
but this the right it's just the right

1066
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,759
amount to catch flying insects and to

1067
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,079
monitor for insects it's like that's

1068
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,399
what you want a nice dry glue yeah um

1069
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,879
and then you put these out um and this

1070
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,799
is a very cost- effective way of doing

1071
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:35,719
that um I actually see this as more of a

1072
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,800
nursery application to be honest yeah um

1073
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,799
personally I think 4-in pots uh clone

1074
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,200
racks at the end of your clone tray

1075
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,919
every clone tray um and the 4-inch pots

1076
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:46,319
and then you move into like U you know a

1077
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,719
bigger one which this is and this is

1078
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,320
actually still considered small for a

1079
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,078
sticky trap yeah but this is what I

1080
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,399
would put so every box comes with 72

1081
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,359
cards and it comes with stands yeah okay

1082
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:56,878
and they're double-sided sticky the same

1083
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,440
exact adhesive like they're really good

1084
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,920
stuff and this one got the grid pattern

1085
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,480
on there yeah so you can do your your

1086
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,800
press monitoring totally like a

1087
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,760
professional and then it comes with a

1088
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,760
stand right here you just go right down

1089
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,440
in the middle and you just put this

1090
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,119
right in the medium okay and then they

1091
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,838
also have the the twist ties of course

1092
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,119
that's the what most people are used to

1093
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:13,679
right you have the hole so you want to

1094
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,000
hang one up there y so to answer your

1095
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,118
question I would put you know one every

1096
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,960
every planner every other the only

1097
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,400
reason why I'm saying that is because I

1098
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,440
have I have people that are doing that

1099
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,320
yeah um I wouldn't I normally this is

1100
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,039
probably the first time I ever actually

1101
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,559
said it so boldly but I have people that

1102
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,838
are doing it it's working you got Miami

1103
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,320
mango yeah you had them on the podcast

1104
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,239
he's a big user of catchmaster he a

1105
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,400
great guy he puts uh he does double

1106
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:34,959
double rock wall you know the tiered so

1107
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,079
he's got one he's got a blue one and and

1108
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,320
a yellow one and the blue blue one is

1109
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,200
actually for monitoring for thrips U so

1110
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,039
that's it's a nice little uh safety net

1111
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,439
to have in there cool um and then of

1112
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,679
course just hanging one every like maybe

1113
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,480
500 square feet or something like that

1114
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,759
above the canopy oh wow yeah for

1115
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,760
monitoring yeah yeah that's that stuff

1116
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,760
and then we have the roll you know I

1117
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,599
don't want to make this too gimmicky

1118
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,839
show all the products but no I mean

1119
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,318
that's kind of what the show is for when

1120
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,000
you got a good product I love sharing

1121
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:01,119
products that are good on my show that's

1122
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
really it's it's it becomes authentic

1123
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,640
rather than like a s it's not a sales

1124
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,760
pitch that's kind of how I like that's

1125
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,519
how I got into you know going from

1126
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,520
companies like Botanica and Ro obviously

1127
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,039
very good companies vital Garden Supply

1128
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,519
you know I do care about who I'm working

1129
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,679
for and what I'm representing you know

1130
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:16,440
just as well as I do those are those

1131
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,279
were great products over the years and

1132
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,119
the the AG roll is really cool this is

1133
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,400
more of a greenhouse application yeah

1134
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,280
and what you're looking at here if you

1135
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,160
don't know already is this is 6 in by

1136
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,880
328 ft of double-sided sticky nice

1137
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:31,118
caution tape yeah it looks like it

1138
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,318
pretty much is you put this one really

1139
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,838
uh traditionally they they put it above

1140
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:36,759
the canopy up above there are people who

1141
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,639
are taking this cutting it in different

1142
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,640
orientations um it's actually more cost

1143
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,679
effective for some people to actually

1144
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:42,199
take it and cut it it's obviously

1145
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,000
Messier a little bit more labor

1146
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,960
intensive to do that in my opinion but I

1147
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,920
have seen it where people are actually

1148
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,358
putting on as end caps in indoor grow

1149
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,318
rooms and stuff like that oh wow I've

1150
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,039
seen um I've even seen Alex experiment

1151
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,119
with taking you know a 4 in or maybe 6

1152
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,318
inch and then cutting it and then

1153
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,280
sticking it on the rock wall you know so

1154
00:36:56,318 --> 00:36:59,039
he's do he's messing around with that

1155
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,240
too getting some good results from it

1156
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,880
nice um yeah but that's yeah that's an

1157
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,199
AG roll so yeah um that's pretty much I

1158
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,960
did bring some I brought one other thing

1159
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,000
too that's way way outside of of the

1160
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,079
what the industry is used to it's called

1161
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,079
a vector flylight yeah and um yeah I'll

1162
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,440
just I'll just pull that's the one I'm

1163
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,720
excited the most about because this is

1164
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,039
this is kind of a game changer and I

1165
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,159
think it's going to be I mean this and I

1166
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,838
think the plant labels are the biggest

1167
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,199
game changer everyone's seen sticky

1168
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,239
cards but um the plant label that's

1169
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:28,439
sticky I think is super new yeah and

1170
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,479
it'll be very useful and then this this

1171
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,480
is actually something that comes from

1172
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,679
the restaurant industry which we wanted

1173
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
I wanted to talk to you about that too

1174
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:35,598
because I know you're you're a

1175
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,000
restaurant guy yeah this is made by

1176
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,960
catcher catch masterer actually bought

1177
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,760
the company Vector uh but they but

1178
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,240
catcher as you know makes glue boards

1179
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,520
yeah I'll show you how this see pull

1180
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,838
this out so the first thought that

1181
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,960
people have is this is a a fly zapper

1182
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,759
like a bug zapper that would be cool but

1183
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,440
see I know that is cool but here's the

1184
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,920
thing it's not sanitary right bug

1185
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,119
zappers are not sanitary you can't

1186
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,039
monitor the insect um there's guts going

1187
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,280
everywhere they actually implode oh yeah

1188
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,079
bugs so this actually is a special UV

1189
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,119
Phillips bulbs that attract flying

1190
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,920
insects and it brings them to a glue

1191
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,318
board here oh wow inside and this glue

1192
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,838
board actually I caught some bugs uh

1193
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:13,639
over down in La I brought this down with

1194
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,199
me in La there's some knats on there

1195
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:17,759
there but this is a Blackboard to hide

1196
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,399
the insects so we do make white ones and

1197
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,920
yellow ones you know and all that for

1198
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,358
better for monitoring um but yeah that's

1199
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,519
how that works it's pretty cool thanks

1200
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,239
for bringing bugs in the facility I know

1201
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,880
right no I know right no these are these

1202
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,479
are these are stuck to the glue board so

1203
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,680
yeah yeah no it's all good that's a good

1204
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,000
point those one snuck by

1205
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,078
me yeah um Homeland where's Homeland

1206
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,280
Security right oh yeah that I think the

1207
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,519
other thing to to to mention because I

1208
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,079
get this a lot is um well Kitt you put

1209
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,318
it in the grow room like that's not it's

1210
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,000
that's not its application you want to

1211
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:47,199
put it outside The Grow rooms everyone's

1212
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,519
got the hallways leading to The Grow

1213
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,078
rooms you got the entrance the exits you

1214
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,800
want to have them all all there another

1215
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,640
thing too is people put them up too high

1216
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,880
yeah you actually want to have them

1217
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,759
about my height which is about 4

1218
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,119
feet and so and you put them up there um

1219
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,040
and uh and you want to have uh near you

1220
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,440
know near uh garbage areas too things

1221
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,279
like that right um and that's just going

1222
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,880
to be a really great addition to an IPM

1223
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,640
protocol and and this if you have

1224
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,358
garbages you should probably have lids

1225
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,400
on your garbage in your grow I think

1226
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,119
that's one of the most important things

1227
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,200
that I see people doing it all the time

1228
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,760
see there you go that's another one they

1229
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,199
miss it that's another one um I mean

1230
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,000
that should be added to IPM protocol is

1231
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,399
making sure the trash is covered yeah

1232
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,039
absolutely yeah we don't even allow

1233
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,160
fruit no fruit in the facility nothing

1234
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:32,199
hey that's good yeah you let me in

1235
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,118
though yeah you're the

1236
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:36,239
exception I'm just kidding okay dude so

1237
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,200
I wanted to tell everyone about this

1238
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,639
little collaboration that we're doing

1239
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:42,318
you brought this special gift for me and

1240
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,799
these are pretty awesome why don't you

1241
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:46,119
tell everybody

1242
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,119
about the collaboration yeah so these

1243
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,200
are so prep packs y um so what they are

1244
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,760
is they're chillums they're American

1245
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,838
Glass by high quality chillums and they

1246
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,359
come with these corks basically right um

1247
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:00,838
the idea is that you they're they're

1248
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,400
always they're always branded you know

1249
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:04,719
they're essentially like um you want to

1250
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,920
put your product in there so you could

1251
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,159
showcase your product so if you're for

1252
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,920
example like you're prom if you're

1253
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:11,118
selling genetics right and you got six

1254
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,960
different genetics this is a good this

1255
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,240
would be a good example right here yeah

1256
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,079
um you could actually have a label on

1257
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:17,639
each one that would have the genetic and

1258
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,800
then within it would either be the seeds

1259
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,799
or or even better maybe have the flow so

1260
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,280
that way they could be like hey if I buy

1261
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
this guy's seeds or buy this guy's

1262
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,440
clones this is the flower that's going

1263
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,119
to be in there right I think that's a

1264
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,318
really clever way of marketing uh your

1265
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,760
brand randomly though but randomly

1266
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:34,599
though yeah so I had these made they

1267
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,720
actually fit perfectly in the Box yeah

1268
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,359
they do yeah so so yeah these These are

1269
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,639
the seed boxes that we have and normally

1270
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:41,838
you get a glass vial and this is some

1271
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,759
synchronicity right here dude some

1272
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,440
serious synchronicity these are boxes he

1273
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,560
already had bade and then I separately

1274
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,480
so in the live chat we are going to be

1275
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:54,759
giving away some of these for trivia

1276
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,679
questions yeah uh yeah really cool dude

1277
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,640

Diesel s you guys know each other from

1334

sour diesel yeah I I met Alex before uh

1335
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,159
this but some of the very best herb that

1336
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:11,199
I've ever sour I've ever seen besides

1337
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:13,358
the stuff I growing and Joe's growing

1338
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,439
has been from Alex yeah I appreciate

1339
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,759
that that means a lot come from really

1340
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,440
good yeah y you know there's like with

1341
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,599
sour I feel like there's like different

1342
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,159
levels of Growers like you got you know

1343
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,359
a guy that can pull it off and make it

1344
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:27,598
look pretty good then there's some guy

1345
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,558
that gets up like maybe eight out of 10

1346
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,240
runs perfect but then there's that

1347
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,599
perfect one and you're like oh H dude

1348
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,239
this is just a different sour yeah and

1349
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,280
he brought that and I actually I think

1350
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,679
the key to that was actually I grew it

1351
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,200
in six different climate six different

1352
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:44,358
like situations and dialed like figured

1353
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:45,919
out what was best that's really I had I

1354
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,519
had I had the advantage oh yeah you had

1355
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,480
the multiple sites I had multiple

1356
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,079
multiple operations spread all over and

1357
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,039
so I was able to actually dial it in you

1358
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,240
know and like literally different things

1359
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,800
like light movers to like I mean

1360
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,759
everything you can imagine I did rock

1361
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,119
wall to Cocoa to what was the best for

1362
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,319
me my uh my best actually was uh Dutch

1363
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,720
pots actually I did I personally I did I

1364
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:08,960
did really good with so just so you guys

1365
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:10,159
we've talked about Dutch pots on the

1366
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,720
show but for those of you guys that

1367
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,838
don't know Dutch spot the Dutch pots

1368
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,279
were uh Square pots with a hole in the

1369
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:18,799
back and they were imported they were $5

1370
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,079
a piece and the only place you could buy

1371
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,960
them that I know of in California was

1372
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,680
the garden spout oh yeah yeah gab Gabby

1373
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,720
man we all know we all know Gabby we

1374
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:30,358
used to there to pick those up you get

1375
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,000
100 of them it was expensive back in the

1376
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:34,039
day you crazy what did you guys like

1377
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,679
about that I've never used one for me

1378
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:38,079
for me it was a frequent watering I was

1379
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,719
frequent watering and and I think I

1380
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,160
think the other part of that was being

1381
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,838
able to correct problems like quickly

1382
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:46,118
was that through a hydro or it was

1383
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:48,558
actually it's actually more popular now

1384
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:52,039
to be in smaller po these were pretty

1385
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,880
small medium m mine was smaller mine I

1386
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:55,318
was doing like two gallon that little

1387
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,519
two gallon they had a few different

1388
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,759
sizes yeah I filled with and then hydron

1389
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:00,280
the hydron in there what were you

1390
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,520
putting in there um I was actually I was

1391
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,760
running B I was running no no they're um

1392
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:06,480
little clay po Pebbles okay now those

1393
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,119
were good for a while then they got kind

1394
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,039
of messed up for a minute they're salty

1395
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,880
and also one of the big problems is they

1396
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:13,279
started getting smaller and they started

1397
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,480
started and they started slipping

1398
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,800
through the elbow and clogging and yeah

1399
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,480
so that that and you couldn't get that

1400
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,880
consistency anymore you know so I I

1401
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,679
ended up switching switching off of that

1402
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,920
after a while but yeah and also I ended

1403
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:26,799
up switching off a sour too off what did

1404
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,480
you switch to um what did I go from sour

1405
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,039
to to um played around with you know

1406
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,000
cookies and OG um and actually I was

1407
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:35,880
able to fall back on Blackberry Kush a

1408
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,358
little bit yeah you know because it has

1409
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,640
it has its fandom you know it had its

1410
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,519

to name them out right but they were

1422
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:05,759

back so we can talk about these old

1436
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,880
school genetics it's great because I

1437
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,200
haven't thought about that so that was

1438
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,000
the shortest flowering outdoor plant

1439
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,960
that I ever G it was the one that never

1440
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,960
had problem with [ __ ] caterpillars

1441
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,119
and not never had a problem with those

1442
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,838
tomato horn worms and it yields it just

1443

1445
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,079
high but man it finished early and The

1446
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:56,920
Taste was amazing I would get 3x3 bushes

1447
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,318
to be over a pound outside you know and

1448

and that was nice cuz that money like

1449
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,800
you're saying would be there early you

1450
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,760
know and you'd have that set up for the

1451
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,680
trimmers coming in for the all year

1452
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,800
totally you know what was the lineage on

1453
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:10,480
that one Dina I don't know I've looked

1454
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,480
at the Jason King book and he has

1455
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,519
something in there that talks about it I

1456
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,679
can't remember but that came from the

1457
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,159
same cat I got that East Coast sour from

1458
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:19,598
he brought me both those at different

1459
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,078
times there was some pink other pink

1460
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,280
strains I remember I just I I don't

1461
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:24,039
remember that full name like pink

1462
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,400
Cadillac or something there's a pink

1463
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:28,719
Cadillac too yeah pink panties was

1464
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,160
that was that should have been called

1465
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,679
black pants it was throwing pink it was

1466
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,679
throwing pink hairs right that was the

1467
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:37,039
the motivation for naming them pink was

1468
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:38,399
that um I think the pink just depending

1469
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,079
on the one because like the Wildberry

1470
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,680
used to throw you know a 78 sour you pop

1471
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,839
those you'd find a whole bunch of those

1472
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:46,960
that would have pink pink pistols

1473
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:50,000
raspberry cheesecake cush also known as

1474

1475
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
pink ones too that was a really popular

1476
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,399

1552
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,318
there on this run well and blue dream

1553
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:51,079
grows big fat monster

1554
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:52,960
buds those colas I mean my outdoor I

1555
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:55,680
remember one time I had the most

1556
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,000
beautiful Cola and I was like looking at

1557
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:01,000
it and I kind of Twisted it a little bit

1558
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,119
and it split in half completely rotted

1559
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,480
in the middle I mean the bud had to be

1560
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,559
like that big yeah and that's what

1561
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,119
happens sometimes you get a little bit

1562
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,640
of moisture in there it turns into

1563
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:13,318
petritis it's all bad it's done yeah no

1564
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,519
that's the worst when you put all that

1565
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,358
effort in you see the most beautiful bud

1566
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,039
and you don't know it's there until you

1567
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,679
just touch it and it does that like you

1568
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,159
said folds over or you're looking for a

1569
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,798
caterpillar and then you go in and all

1570
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,719
of a sudden it falls apart you're like

1571
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:30,239
now my eye that was the beginning years

1572
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,039
of vtis but now my eye I can see it from

1573
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,719
so far away you're walking in there's

1574
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:36,318
that one leaf on the bud that's like

1575
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,759
crinkled and you're like oh an off color

1576
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:39,639
and you're like oh my God you can see it

1577
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,440
from 10 feet away totally and then

00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,240
time oh yeah when that when that was

1601
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,118
going on the ogs were obliterated right

1602
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:33,279
by the mites I don't was that the first

1603
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,798
round when russet mes came it was no one

1604
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,480
knew what it was everyone thought it was

1605
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:38,798
systemic disease right you know they

1606
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,240
thought it was a deficiency or disease

1607
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:41,759
whatever it was exactly that that was

1608
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,838
the last time I grew Blue Dream actually

1609
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,520
and actually once you learn how to treat

1610
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,239
russed M it's not a big deal not a big

1611
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:48,480
deal anymore but I called my mom cuz

1612

00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,839
uh I just told her was up and and then I

1616
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,318
cashed her out for it and then now I now

1617
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,279
I own you know one of you know one of

1618
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:03,440
them so nice yeah yeah yeah so we traded

1619
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,480
a pound of blue for generator totally

1620
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,240
legit no I was stoked I'm like I already

1621
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,960
have one taken care of it's handled and

1622
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:11,639
it was like week seven oh yeah that's

1623
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,920
the coffee out I was at week seven so

1624
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:16,078
the nugs were thick right yeah and the

1625
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,880
power goes out for four days I'd already

1626
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,798
been cutting out the mold and then you

1627
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,119
came through with that it saved that

1628
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:24,599
thing I still hit three pounds of light

1629
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,440
because this

1630
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,559
is this is the work to do it this is the

1631
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,639
working man's weed boys right it's

1632
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:34,280
anybody can grow it it's grows itself

1633
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,558
you just feed it a little bit extra I

1634
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,519
notice this having right cut too though

1635
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,880
I used more than anything oh yeah this

1636
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:41,280
is a good C that's the other thing too

1637
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,599
cuz like yeah sorry yeah you're going to

1638
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,839
be I think you're going to have these

1639
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,838
pre-rolled right I used to have a saying

1640
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:49,558
yeah you could [ __ ] in the reservoir and

1641
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:53,199
you'd still get 2.2 pounds of

1642
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:56,000
light dream with Dre you absolutely

1643
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:58,159
could it was it's the it's the one thing

1644
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,519
that like like it's really easy to grow

1645
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:02,000
it's the most vigorous plant the

1646
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,519
structure is great it it makes you feel

1647
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,119
good every time you grow it you feel

1648
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,599
good about it it's fun you were saying

1649
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,240
that when you walk into the room it it

1650
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:09,640
makes you feel good about being there it

1651
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,039
does you feel like you know what you're

1652
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:13,759
doing it does man it's not always like

1653
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:15,239
that with stuff there's finicky genetics

1654
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,319
that they don't come out right every

1655
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:18,719
time you do they don't they're not a 10

1656
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:21,079
out of 10 every time where I feel like

1657
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:23,519
blue dream is fairly easy to knock it

1658
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:25,318
out of the park it's pretty easy man I

1659
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,079
needed one like that so I was happy

1660
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:29,639
actually you link me with the guy who

1661
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:32,440
gave me the Clones right yeah so shout

1662
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:34,279
out to Nick you know um he came through

1663
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,039
with the most Stellar Cuts I've gotten

1664
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,760
in a long time and I told him you know

1665
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,719
normally I won't tell a guy because I

1666
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,559
don't want him to inflate the price he's

1667
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:43,318
got he's got this this is a limited

1668
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:44,960
Source you know this guy I said hey bro

1669
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:47,119
these are some of the best I've seen in

1670
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,119
a long time I mean the stems I'm not

1671
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:53,640
exaggerating are as thick as pencils

1672
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:56,000
every time yeah on his cuts and uh so

1673
00:54:53,639 --> 00:55:00,440
that round turned out really good I used

1674
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:04,318
the micro life I use biologic and um and

1675
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:06,599
and just killed it it's so simple you

1676
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:08,440
know like the grow I mean it's almost

1677
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:09,960
identical to the grow and actually the

1678
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,159
the last time I got you Cuts was um I

1679
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,639
got you the Sher Banger I think yeah and

1680
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,960
Sher good one his sh Banger bro sh

1681
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,719
Banger before a lot of people got theb

1682
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,280
that's right yeah and and the thing was

1683
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,318
is his the way that that indoor sh

1684
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,319
Banger came out yeah I like I prized

1685
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,798
that that I mean that weed so far I mean

1686
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,440
I travel all the United States you know

1687
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:29,960
what I mean and I know I know you travel

1688
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,240
too and stuff it's like blue dream for

1689
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,760
example I go around look it's not blue

1690
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:34,199
dream okay like if you say they together

1691
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,839
Blue Dream It's not blue dream no you

1692
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:38,759
know but there's a lot of s1's out there

1693
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:40,480
that's what happens is people get a bag

1694
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,359
seed and they're this round one like

1695
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,440
there's this one that's going around

1696
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:44,759
that's like round it's like rounded is I

1697
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,318
mean this is the shape you want to see

1698
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:51,000
you know you want it to knuckle out like

1699
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:52,639
that yeah it's all still it knuckled out

1700
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,760
extra because of the humidity spikes

1701
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,558
that I was it looks like it's never

1702
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,319
going to finish too totally look like it

1703
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,359
could just go on and on it does it keep

1704
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:03,719
popping white hairs a pistol like it

1705
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,639
just just it kept on I put it on the

1706
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:08,078
scale I'm like this thing keeps clocking

1707
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:10,960
in I'm like this is a heavy hitter it's

1708
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:14,200
a heavy hitter and you can just push you

1709
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,838
smoking speaking of yeah it will smoke

1710
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:19,318
yeah I mean it basically it it'll it'll

1711
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:20,440
eat it'll drink it's it's super it's a

1712
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:23,159
happy

1713
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,519
plant and yeah needs extra water

1714
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:26,639
compared to the rest of the genetics I

1715
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:28,759
was running yeah and a lot more food

1716
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,920
this one feeds so I think sativas are

1717
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,799
making a comeback yeah I agree and I'm

1718
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,960
happy finally people are starting to

1719
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:37,358
figure that out some guys will say that

1720
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,119
no but I would say that sativas

1721
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,719
are

1722
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,519
think the older you get the stronger the

1723
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:46,719
weed

1724
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:48,798
got yeah I want that leathery sativa

1725
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,679

1756
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,119
jagu and called it jger nice I've seen

1757
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,920
that around I got I think I even grew

1758
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,200
that actually that was you yeah cool

1759
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,000
yeah I crossed that and then cloned it

1760
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:05,159
and got it around for a little while and

1761
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,159
yeah I'm I'm sure there's other

1762
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:09,199
iterations of that that's crazy that

1763
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:12,639
right yeah I either I can't remember if

1764
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,759
we grew that J Joe and I are a homie

1765
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:15,798
might grabb it from you might have

1766
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,359
grabbed it from my house yeah maybe I I

1767
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:19,000
don't I know I've seen it around lry

1768
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:20,000
Bubba like I said I'm I don't I didn't

1769
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,838
want to come on here and say I'm like

1770
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,039
you know I'm a breeder or genetics guy

1771
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:25,400
but like I I played around enough to

1772
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:28,480
where I did one full year of J seeds

1773
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,559
yeah you know and I was I I shockingly

1774
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,318
for some reason it I had the intuition

1775
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:35,760
to like do a bunch of early like low low

1776
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:37,119
rider crosses before it was popular

1777
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,480
totally like way before all of a sudden

1778
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,318
it became like that was realing the

1779
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,440
value in having something that for me

1780
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:42,679
because I was going up on the hills and

1781
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,599
we were trying to get those extra runs

1782
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:46,519
out and not have to pull tarps and do

1783
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,680
that's crazy you knew that because I was

1784
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:51,318
reading that stuff in the 90s going I

1785
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:52,318
would never buy that yeah that was the

1786
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:53,239
thing was that was the thing is you

1787
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:54,960
could get them like right you could

1788
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:56,719
order Amsterdam they had all the the low

1789
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,280
rider crosses that's why I call them low

1790
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,480
riders cuz that's an Amsterdam that's

1791
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,680
what they were call yeah blue Low Rider

1792
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,679
red low rider it was Canadian term right

1793
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:06,480
cuz it was a

1794
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,358
BCC did that yeah it was the BC dep that

1795
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,199
were running them because the BC guys I

1796
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:12,279
mean

1797
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:13,960
the were doing the a first can't

1798
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,359
remember the breeder up there but he was

1799
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,440
popular and he that was what he

1800
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:18,798
specialized on I was like I would never

1801
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,200
[ __ ] with that but now look at I think

1802
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,199
it was Atomic something huh right do you

1803
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:26,399
remember that uh Atomic anyways that was

1804
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:28,318
some of the first Auto flowers um I was

1805
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,079
I was messing with the the Mexican rudal

1806
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:32,519
stuff like I was CU a lot of those Ludy

1807
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,798
that's where you could get the cheap

1808
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:36,119
like bulk you all that and so I but I

1809
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,079
kind of got real friendly with them and

1810
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,079
I was kind of kind of bringing in some

1811
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,000
crosses of that stuff it was never good

1812
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,400
though I always SM like hey no but there

1813
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,639
was some good ones there was some orange

1814
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,720
ones I never saw the really good ones I

1815
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:49,078
only saw the coming down cuz well from

1816
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:51,838
California we were getting them from the

1817
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:54,119
guys in the valley or I will say it too

1818
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,639
though a lot of it was brick that was

1819
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,920
reconstituted from from and called they

1820
00:59:56,639 --> 00:59:58,920
called that Arizona weed that's

1821
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,440
hilarious and they would just

1822
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,159
reconstitute it and then call it early

1823
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,480
girl right do you guys remember

1824
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:07,078
the we were talking about blueberry cush

1825
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,400
being called Blackberry cush yeah yeah

1826
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:11,640
Blackberry cry cush but back in the day

1827
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,880
like you get weed from Mexico and if it

1828
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:16,639
was green it was the prend or the Mexi

1829
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,760
the Mexican indicas yeah yeah well

1830
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:18,920
that's where the whole there was

1831
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,559
probably it was probably there was some

1832
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,798
press green stuff that was okay it would

1833
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,798
get you high and it didn't give you as

1834
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:25,199
much of a headache yeah totally and you

1835
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:26,679
were stoked when that came through at

1836
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:28,000
least I was break it up and you put it

1837
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:31,318
in the room with the shower on and get

1838
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,199
that [ __ ] to poof up that's not how we

1839
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:36,798
we just smoked it on a can you see I'm a

1840
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,239
little your parents trained you up yeah

1841
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:39,960
cuz my dad was my dad had that stuff

1842
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:43,838
they had the dry version

1843
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,559
yeah yeah you knew me what to do if you

1844
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,880
haven't had a seed pop off a can you

1845
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:51,839
don't know what going smoke it

1846
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,480
is right popcorn popcorn yeah oh yeah

1847
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:56,880
that's that's old

1848
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:59,318
school I love it awesome good stuff yeah

1849
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,000
man what other old strains dude there's

1850
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:03,639
so many there's so many let's say uh so

1851
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,960
you stole both of mine I wanted to say

1852
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:07,519
Hanan and uh and I wanted to say pink

1853
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,000
cream well we talked about the kushage

1854
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,679
so tell us about the cush because you

1855
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,440
used to crush the cush um that's Adam

1856
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:17,719
done OG times the sage to to the sage

1857
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,039
and interesting enough that thing really

1858
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:24,118
was uh PM resistant it was leafy yeah no

1859
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:26,799
mine the one I have had a great K Leaf

1860
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:29,440
ratio in my opinion was not good hash

1861
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,239
maker probably but incredible producer

1862
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,720
one of the heaviest yielder strains I've

1863
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:37,919
ever grown was that kushage and it threw

1864
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,959
off a tart note and a creamy note and

1865
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,480
then I put it to the Durban and that's

1866
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,400
where we got the raspberry cheesecake

1867
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,440
cush cuz it had where Rasberry chees and

1868
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,639
and flavor come through it got shortened

1869
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,039
down to just the raspberry cush later

1870
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,639
and a lot of people mistake the

1871
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,480
Blackberry and raspberry they look

1872
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:56,598
totally different but um that kushage

1873
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,559
and then I've grown his Sage

1874
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,000
which is phenomenal if you get a good

1875
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:03,359
how many weeks how many weeks did that

1876
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,119
shout out to Adam and Mojave yeah big up

1877
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,078
boys for sure that's the the real strong

1878
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:10,640
[ __ ] the real strong yeah how many weeks

1879
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:14,079
would that run the the the raspberry uh

1880
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:17,960
it was like 62 63 days yeah was nine

1881
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:21,359
weeks yeah and then but the sage is uh I

1882
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:24,199
have access to some seeds that are from

1883
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:28,159
Adam's creation of the sage a a mutual

1884
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:30,679
friend of ours um Spiker he's uh one of

1885
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,759
the owners of Dutch lighting Innovations

1886
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:34,519
he's giving me those genetics that Adam

1887
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,920
gave back to him long story and I'll let

1888
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:38,278
him tell you the story sometime you

1889
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,798
should definitely have them up here but

1890
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:44,400
uh the seeds that were used to make that

1891
01:02:41,798 --> 01:02:46,480
they lost the genetics and so Bo still

1892
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,240
had them and Adam reached out to Bo and

1893
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,798
Bo gave him and so Adam gave him the

1894
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,919
seeds that created the sage yeah and B's

1895
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:53,719
going to give I remember picking up some

1896
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,960
packs of that Sage actually with some uh

1897
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:57,679
God's breath I think it was oh really

1898
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,480
was that God's breath was good or God's

1899
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:02,078
Gift God's Gift someone made God's

1900
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,519
breath though I remember seeing packs of

1901
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,760
God's that's why it came to mind but I

1902
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:06,960
think it was God's at that time it was

1903
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,480
God's gift but I think it wasn't to the

1904
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,400
Lamb's bre I breath I think it was to

1905
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,838
like a shark's Breath Right that one the

1906
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,278
God you had shark's breath yeah God's

1907
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,038
shark breath was it shark's tooth no

1908
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:18,480
there wasar breath shark's breath they

1909
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,000
had that so I feel like I feel like when

1910
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,039
I was picking up th all those packs kind

1911
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,079
of came together almost yeah the sage I

1912
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,240
saw the sage what was that guy um that

01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,880
making seeds of stuff that didn't taste

1917
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,318
like as Americans we were like wait a

1918

Strawberry Cough good one yeah I like

1921
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,640
strawberry cough that was that was

1922
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:45,798
Banner Bruce Banner from the strawberry

1923
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,639
cough but yeah the Strawberry Cough is

1924
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:51,079
fire yeah you know the I didn't like

1925
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:53,318
growing the cough because the you have

1926
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:56,039
to thin and release that one so crazy it

1927
01:03:53,318 --> 01:03:57,358
branches out so much I like the fort

1928
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:59,720
cough better than the Strawberry Cough

1929
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,440
that for cough is good it's super

1930
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:03,159
special I think I got some seeds of that

1931
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,119
I made some banana banana Skittles yeah

1932
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:06,159
the banana the banana cough is fire ban

1933
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,079
cough I think I got that there should be

1934
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,118
some really good got of those in there

1935
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,200
that was made in my backyard so yeah

1936
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:13,400
that's train hand water that's going to

1937
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:17,239
be and it's going to be grown in my back

1938
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:21,200
King mix age old hand water still hand

1939
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:23,598
water so even at scale I enjoy I don't

1940
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:25,919
know I I yeah 80 plants in my backyard

1941
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,640
yeah and I woke up every morning I

1942
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,838
watered them I Joe helped me water

1943
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:31,118
sometimes when I was gone or whatever

1944
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:33,159
out of town but yeah like I mean we hand

1945
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:35,440
water I I still enjoy I won't do it

1946
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:38,118
indoors I don't think it's practical I

1947
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,760
think handw watering is you know for me

1948
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:41,000
I'm not a huge handw watering fan indoor

1949
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,278
but waking up in the morning where

1950
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,920
you're tending to plants in your

1951
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:46,880
backyard that's fun yeah it is I still I

1952
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,240
still do it that's that's a thing now

1953
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,000
I'm on the road all the time I you like

1954
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:51,598
I said I used to grow a lot yeah I had

1955
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,119
to like you know I gave that a lot of

1956
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,440
that up to you know for the ancillary

1957
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,400
Market you know hitting hitting the

1958
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,278
United States and traveling and all that

1959
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,278
but I still make sure I always I always

1960
01:04:58,278 --> 01:05:01,880
got my plants I do full season right now

1961
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:04,199
I was doing you know I tapered tapered

1962
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,880
from doing indoor to doing Deb and then

1963
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:07,759
yeah back to full grown and started in

1964
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,400
full grown you know full sun right but I

1965
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,960
love it man and I love I love just

1966
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,599
having like all different strains and

1967
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:16,240
stuff dude I still hand water even two

1968
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,798
acres I'll hand I won't do it by myself

1969
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:20,519
but me and my guys will hand water two

1970
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:22,960
acres indoor outdoor not at all and I've

1971
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:24,880
got over 30 years doing it but the

1972
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,880
reason why I do it is cuz I know it so

1973
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,160
well you do it I understand it and it

1974
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,240
understands me for me to try and learn a

1975
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,000
different curve right now just there's

1976
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,439
not enough incentive in it I actually

1977
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,519
enjoy it it's you teach the system to to

1978
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,400
water like you that's the thing you have

1979
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:42,679
to teach it yeah of course but I really

1980
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,960
enjoy it's kind of like my time like my

1981
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:46,759
drive out to the farm and my space away

1982
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,838
I don't have cell reception it's so

1983
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,799
funny because you lived in the same

1984
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:51,119
county but it was like such a long drive

1985
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:54,679
to get up to

1986
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:58,278
C yeah used to Caz was a little bit of a

1987
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:59,558
tri in 20 minutes more 20 minutes that's

1988
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:03,719
two joints

1989
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:04,839
country windy roads C joint yeah exactly

1990
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:06,519
some of our best times going up there

1991
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:08,199
too hang out you know it's not like

1992
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:11,038
driving up the 101 for an hour and a

1993
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:13,159
half where you got CHP up your ass you

1994
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,480
know like I'd see a sheriff a few times

1995
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:18,598
a year driving out to cow that was it

1996
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,920
yeah so smoking splits was great premium

1997
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,880
weather too up there like you know had

the [ __ ] elevation and

2001
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:32,400
banana belt that cazadero has you know

really good for growing yeah you grew

2004
01:06:34,278 --> 01:06:37,480
some good flare out of there for sure

2005
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,559

2013
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:59,719
[ __ ] awesome yeah that's the spot

2014

where you can see it 30 minutes away you

2015

drive up to it pretty cool yeah so

2017
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,318

CBD drinks and all that too yeah yeah

2054
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:27,959
you know it's actually funny too the

2055
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,358
thing about hops too that I find a lot

2056
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,838
of people just learning this for the

2057
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:34,239
first time like they think of alcohol

2058
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:36,238
right drinks yeah as just alcohol what's

2059
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,678
the content like you know but you got to

2060
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:39,639
remember these are you know what's why

2061
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,239
they call them Spirits these are Elixir

2062
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,719
you know and and they're all different

2063
01:08:41,238 --> 01:08:46,238
things and one of the best examples and

2064
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:49,600
proof of that is a hoppy beer hops is

2065
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:51,599
hops the hyoids is actually a uh a

2066
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,600
nervous system sedative oh wow on its

2067
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,279
own for so like forget the liquor and

2068
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,600
the alcohol part a total the alcohol

2069
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:02,480
form so then you start about that when

2070
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:03,520
you think that like tequila vodka um rum

2071
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:05,238
all these different things people go I

2072
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,960
can't drink rum but I can drink tequila

2073
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:08,119
yeah well why is that that's because

2074
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,759
it's something to do with like the

2075
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:11,238
alkaloids or the extracts that they have

2076
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,039
from that plant yeah you know what I

2077
01:09:11,238 --> 01:09:16,000
mean and so I think that's kind of cool

2078
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:18,759
like the Hops and hops actually uh you

2079
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,238
know grafts to cannabis you know I know

2080
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:22,359
they I've done it I really I know they

2081
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:24,158
gra that's one of the coolest things

2082
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:26,279
ever you got to send us pictures for

2083
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:28,000
yeah so I so I had humb Hops and when I

2084
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:30,239
my house in Windsor I had humble hops I

2085
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,279
got it from Humble Hydroponics there

2086
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,599
they had it under uh in their little

2087
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:35,600
tents you know they're growing hops in

2088
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,359
there and I got I took a cutting yeah

2089
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,239
from that I brought it down and I

2090
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:43,600
[ __ ] uh I I uh grafted it to chem dog

2091
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:46,439
91 that's awesome wild they're R right

2092
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,440
so they grow and they they go dormant

2093
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:50,238
and then they pop up and grow like

2094
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:51,318
wildfire they're they're really awesome

2095
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,759
they're really awesome yeah you can

2096
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:55,600
actually um yeah they're well Vine they

2097
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,640
grow very different than cannabis

2098
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,520
different but they they're genetically

2099
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,880
similar enough to graph to each well

2100
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,239
they're from the same family for those

2101
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,800
who don't know but yeah for sure yeah

2102
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:07,839
you can grow one on the

2103
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,560
other you can grow a cannabis you can

2104
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,039
grow cannabis on on a hop and you can

2105
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,120
grow h on a Canabis I didn't know they

2106
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:15,359
I've done it no I've only done it one

2107
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,158
way I've only done hops on

2108
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:18,319
cannabis yeah let's do it let's let's

2109
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:20,559
let's spark it up again and do it you

2110
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:23,158
know I'm all about R&amp;D so that is a

2111
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,199
great R&amp;D thing yeah that's right fun

2112
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:26,158
that could lead to a lot the whole

2113
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:28,839
grafting thing is always interested me

2114
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:31,439
mik and I back in the day we almost did

2115
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:33,520
a nursery project where we got OG Kush

2116
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:35,639
and we were going to graft it for you

2117
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,239
know the outdoor season sell graphs of

2118
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,239
Blue Dream o cool Bush yeah because OG

2119
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,359
Kush has like a small root Zone it

2120
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:44,959
struggles a little bit but what happens

2121
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:46,719
when you put it on a blue dream you know

2122
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,600
like put on a blue dream and I actually

2123
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:52,600
think that root that's that's that's an

2124
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,280
that's a an R&amp;D valid thing to do is to

2125
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,000
see what kind of effect I probably the

2126
01:10:54,279 --> 01:11:00,279
best root talk to put anything on would

2127
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,960
be a blue dream yeah yeah OG on a blue

2128
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:05,399
dream gra root stock right there yeah

2129
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,800
hey that's maybe that's the next stage

2130
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:08,000
because you know it's there are some

2131
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,640
crazy ass fruit trees out there of

2132
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,960
course it's much easier for an an

2133
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,800
something that grows year after year

2134
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,880
after year the same root stock right to

2135
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,960
when you graft to something like that

2136
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,640
that's you know you're you're

2137
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,079
encouraging that more and more multiple

2138
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,800
strains so you just have multiple

2139
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:21,880
flavors yeah well in the egg World

2140
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,920
they've had to do that with fruits with

2141
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,359
fruits with walnuts avocados y yeah

2142
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,079
walnuts yeah yeah it's for so they would

2143
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:30,238
self-pollinate and all that that's

2144
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:32,519
another reason it's male and female they

2145
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:34,158
do male and female like Walnut The Roots

2146
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,600
the black walnut I think it was the

2147
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:39,079
American Walnut the root stock was much

2148
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,280
stronger than the European Walnut Y and

2149
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:42,639
so everything was dying from Europe so

2150
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,319
they figured out how to graft it onto

2151
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:46,159
theer yeah so all of them that's

2152
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:47,920
actually that's that's actually a great

2153
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:50,279
segue for wanting to invite both you

2154
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,480
guys to Kendall Jackson wiy I want to do

2155
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:54,238
a lunch out

2156
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:56,279
there my brother's a chef out over there

2157
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:57,479
incredible chef of the best in the world

2158
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:00,439
and the reason why I mentioned that is

2159
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:03,158
because that's an old an old Walnut Farm

2160
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:04,839
It's actually an old old Walnut Grove Y

2161
01:12:03,158 --> 01:12:06,960
and they you don't know this actually

2162
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:10,400
sorry to interrupting but James is a

2163
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,520
incredible Chef incred yeah he know talk

2164
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,799
a little

2165
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,320
bit I just got it well we actually

2166
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:18,000
mostly talked about it in person I think

2167
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:19,759
or private about you being in the food

2168
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,880
World a whole different level like your

2169
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,480
brother yeah yeah yeah well that's

2170
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,760
actually what really inspired me to like

2171
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:25,439
to invite you guys out to there like

2172
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,000
there's two reasons is like there's the

2173
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,638
food aspect but it's also like a farm to

2174
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,719
table environment and stuff and I look I

2175
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:32,520
don't work for Kendall Jackson but but

2176
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,840
but but my brother does and it's and

2177
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,159
it's it's an awesome environment out

2178
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,800
there like their Master Gardener out

2179
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:39,519
there um I'll have to get you the name

2180
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,159
later what his name is but ni um it's

2181
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,199
just the most Immaculate thing they also

2182
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:45,960
do like a thing where they do a uh where

2183
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:47,759
you smell different foliages like they

2184
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,639
grow different plants that you smell

2185
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,000
while you drink wine really I think

2186
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:52,440
that's really cool so instead of being a

2187
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,760
pairing because they do food pairing and

2188
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:56,719
all that which you expect but they also

2189
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,400
do where they grow plants just for their

2190
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,719
smell nice you know for their you know

2191
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:01,079
and you you break them and you take a

2192
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:02,840
sip of the wine and part of that

2193
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:05,158
experience yeah it's pretty cool yeah

2194
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,039
yeah we'll have to do that maybe maybe

2195
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:10,479
bring the show down all right Stoners

2196
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:12,800
let's reel it in here what other

2197
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:15,519
strains so cat

2198
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,320
piss that's like a hot topic on my show

2199
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,320
that hot topic for debate is cat it's a

2200
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,799
real catpiss back in the day was so good

2201
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,479
so there's people saying it came out of

2202
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,520
San Diego there's people saying it came

2203
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:27,479
out of everywhere anything that somebody

2204
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,880
that had amonia smelled like cat piss

2205
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:31,599
they called it cat so it's not like blue

2206
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:34,119
dream or it's a specific name that's my

2207
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,880
opinion we're doing a do people get to

2208

2228
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:22,000
bright OG actually I mean still nothing

2229
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,600
to this day like I was saying this

2230
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,760
earlier it beats K 91 for me I I I think

2231
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,920
that one goes down in the Guinness book

2232
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,880
for me as like just all around High the

2233
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,679
turps I know it's not the best

2234
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,560
commercially to grow you know yeah it's

2235
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,000
not as tight of a structure yeah it

2236
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,520
doesn't yield it can have a really good

2237
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,760
structure it just you indoor it was

2238
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,360
really good the structure was really

2239
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,000
good I wouldn't say it has the best

2240
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:48,599
structure it's so subjective

2241
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,840
right it might not fit the purple candy

2242
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:53,039
gas model but it fits the model that I

2243
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,199
like and that you like model yeah that

2244
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:56,840
tur model for me is right there the Kim

2245
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:58,799
91 but I were out I like the smell of

2246
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,279
burnt tires there's something that just

2247
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,560
brings me back I would actually use the

2248
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:02,679
word when I was like when I was like

2249
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,400
checking pounds out cuz you know you got

2250
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:05,760
to you got to when you're brokering you

2251
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,439
got to look at pounds and check them out

2252
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,960
yeah that's that was I use burnt burnt

2253
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:10,359
rubber is what I use burnt rubber but I

2254
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,279
was always looking for I was like but

2255
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:14,359
before

2256
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:16,519
anybody well we're talking before

2257
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:18,158
Instagram Instagram he was saying that

2258
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,239
[ __ ] I was saying it before but I want

2259
01:15:18,158 --> 01:15:23,920
to say like Kim 91's great for sure and

2260
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:26,599
big up Kim dog and the whole though it's

2261
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,800
a high two but that's Sour Diesel is my

2262
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,360
favorite smoke all around cuz the flavor

2263
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,320
of that is just what I prefer and side

2264
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,000
by side I I'd rather smoke that I think

2265
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:36,279
it burns better in a joint and it was

2266
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,760
named sour because it soured

2267
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:39,079
relationships but it did the opposite

2268
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,119
for us cuz I mean we're here today

2269
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:43,079
because of sour there's a lot of great

2270
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:45,238
stories we have that are positive about

2271
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:48,039
Sour Diesel yes oh I've raised three

2272
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:49,718
daughters yeah yeah more positive than

2273
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:51,279
negative especially friendship wise like

2274
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:52,560
it brought us together Sour Diesel was

2275
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:55,359
the one that brought us together not

2276
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,480
that Kim dog didn't Kim dog to you the

2277
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:58,880
sour I had you gave me the Kim you had

2278
01:15:57,479 --> 01:16:01,718
and I think I gave you my silver back

2279
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,600
gorilla at that time too you did and uh

2280
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:05,840
but I'd been looking for that we'll talk

2281
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,880
about the whole story later but the uh

2282
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,039
the Kim dog I got from you was really

2283
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,359
good the 91 I got from sent out from

2284
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:14,238
Boston and it was good from

2285
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:17,359
Massachusetts from the cape actually

2286
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:19,158
yeah um and but side by side for me

2287
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,960
personally I just like the smoke the way

2288
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,599
it smokes in a joint is the sour you

2289
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,439
know and the flavor you know for oh I

2290
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:29,039
got I got I got one thing that we got to

2291
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:32,359
talk about before you guys go what is it

2292
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:35,039
the HK oh yeah the Henry Kissinger let's

2293
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:37,079
talk about it man you might not know

2294
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,439
about it because you're a little younger

2295
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:41,960
no I was like was it Hindu Kush yeah

2296
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:44,399
good yeah so you know about it Kissinger

2297
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,359
the Kissinger yeah the Kissinger was

2298
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:51,198
yeah that was the one that was

2299
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:52,519
the amazing TPS it was before OG cush

2300
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:54,919
and before all this at least my

2301
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,480
experience like that was the original

2302
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,719
Master Kush too bub it was very

2303
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,279
different than OG kush yeah there was

2304
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,198
Master cush and Bubba Kush with that too

2305
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:03,920
master cush and Bubba was like yeah that

2306
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:06,079
was like late 90s there was the master

2307
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,520
and the Bubba and I loved both of those

2308
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,000
they were both top shelf those were the

2309
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,440
Exotics those some of my first I think

2310
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,319
my first Exotics structure on the master

2311
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:15,559
sucked it grew like the it would

2312
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:17,719
basically grow sideways the buds would

2313
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,679
have like side branches it was side

2314
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:20,920
branching on actual I'm a little younger

2315
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,279
than you guys just a little bit just

2316
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,960
enough to wear like those were my first

2317
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:26,880
Exotics for wasn't it a lower yielder

2318
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,679
too I think so it was G and it was

2319
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,039
really

2320
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:33,800
like always got petritis you SM It Bubba

2321
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:36,760
was fire though soapy that that's a

2322
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,119
soapy too soapy for me and the btis so I

2323
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:41,320
I I peeled

2324
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:43,158
off with it because I was like that's a

2325
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:44,639
potential the yield was a nice and the

2326
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,519
look had did you make the Larry Bubba

2327
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:49,119
who made the Larry Bubba that was you I

2328
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:51,239
got it from Joe I think actually that

2329
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:53,000
was a good one oh I didn't make that but

2330
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:55,039
uh what were we talking about Hindu Kush

2331
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,359
uh Hindu Kush yeah oh yeah we were

2332
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,760
getting 6,400 a pound for that in the

2333
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:02,439
early '90s

2334
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:04,719
yeah was buy 1 o or you could buy like

2335
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:07,919
how yeah how old I was like nine or 10

2336
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:10,319
years old and like 92 91 so that was 98

2337
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,880
is where kind of where I got in like 90

2338
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,198
97 98 just but I was young then too like

2339
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,560
91 was the first year I started SP yeah

2340
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:19,559
and that's I'm I'm over here saying Kim

2341
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:22,120
91 is my favorite album I had 91 was a

2342
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,440
great year we had the we had the seeds

2343
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:27,439
we were running We Grew From seed only

2344
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:28,599
and was from the Cincy seed stock and I

2345
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:31,839
think that was their

2346
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:34,000
nl2 right do you remember James back

2347
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,800
then I don't remember because I was just

2348
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,319
I got jumped into this group uh as a new

2349
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,960
grower and they were already established

2350
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:44,599
like older guys and I was the new kid

2351
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,679
you know and so but later on I've tried

2352
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:50,280
to figure out what was that Hindu Kush

2353
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:52,679
that we had um from Neville because yeah

2354
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:53,960
uh and what I've deduced it down to and

2355
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:55,279
don't quote me on it but I think it's

2356
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,920
there nl2

2357
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:58,840
is where the Hindu Kush came from

2358
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,399
interesting and they changed it later

2359
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,880
years to Hindu Kush it's own it's the

2360
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:07,279
Hindu Kush is like a the mountain range

2361
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,119
in the it's a region yeah reg so there's

2362
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:12,439
obviously a story behind it for Kush

2363
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:14,319
Valley the Hindu Kush yeah yeah but it I

2364
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:16,439
think the Hindu Kush yeah I think it

2365
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:18,599
also means something like Warrior or

2366
01:19:16,439 --> 01:19:21,119
Destroyer like a hind the Hindu word

2367
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,440
Kush I think that has to do with oh

2368
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:24,599
there's more meaning behind it yeah a

2369
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:26,000
lot of violence and destruction yeah

2370
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,679
