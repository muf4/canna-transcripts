31

walk the food is good, you know. I just

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
felt your vibe cooking and how you

33
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,118

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
vibe. Yeah. That's what I I feel like

38
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,840
that's what cooking is all about. That's

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
what I love about cooking, right? It's

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
like one thing making some food, just

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
giving it to people, but it's another

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
thing when you can provide an experience

43
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,359
where people are like they they embrace

44
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,719
the experience, they love it, and

45
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,280
they're like, "Wow, this was amazing."

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,718
Right. You get people blown away by some

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,478
food where you give them stuff that they

48
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,919
wouldn't normally eat together. Yes. You

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,519
know, where we're torching the s'mores

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,359

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
was well orchestrated. We had a good

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,000
team. They had some good videographers

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,280
there to capture it. And then there was

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,318
good weed, too. So, you can't go wrong.

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,439
Oh, yeah. You can't say. Yeah. Yeah. I

81
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,039
love when they rent the houses like

82
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,560
that. And that that house was designed

83
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,840
specifically for parties, you know? It's

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,598
like I couldn't do that at my house.

up, something like that. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,719
Smoked out with Tyson or whatever. Yeah.

121
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,959
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's it's

122
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,478
impressive seeing guys that I feel like

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,238
guys that belong in the place like Snoop

124
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,319
Do Yeah. Snoop Snoop, someone who

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,519
belongs in the space, cannabis, you get

126
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,800
other guys that are trying to just

127
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,959
profit off it. And then you got guys

128
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
like Mike Tyson that believe in it. Like

129
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,719
I I believe he belongs in this space. He

130
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,399
belongs with us, you know? Yeah. And and

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
it's and he's and he smokes it not

132
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,399
because of the habit. I think because of

133
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,319
what he been through as a boxer, you

134
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,159
know, it helps him out, you know, cuz

135
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,680
you know, boxers fighting, he get

136
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
anxiety probably, you know, he's really

137
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
anxiety type person. I can tell probably

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,240
a post-t trauma type of person. So the

139
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,239
weed relaxes him and puts him in a movie

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,918
because if you notice, he doesn't get

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,439
into it with a lot of people like he

142
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:58,079
used to. Um he hang like I seen him and

143
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,560
uh Jake Paul at the I think it was some

144
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,159
event Super Bowl or something some event

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,519

146
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
jumped on his shoulder and they walked

147
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,240

162
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,960
myself. I cooked. But never on tour. So

163
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,120
me and Ricky rocked real close at me

164
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,478
being the tour manager for my the

165
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,319
company I worked with and him working

166
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,079
with Snoop. We got really real close.

167
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,560
Like like real close. Like I remember

168
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,560
Ricky had short haircut. And then when I

169
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,839
seen him years later with the long hair,

170
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,959
I didn't know who he was. I really

171
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,560
didn't know who he was. I'm like, "Who's

172
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,079
you, man? You calling my name?" You

173
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,839
know, cuz I don't like people knowing me

174
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,959
and I don't know them. Yeah. And I'm not

175
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
going to ask you what's your name. I

176
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,918
feel that's embarrassing your name. And

177
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,839
he said, "Man, it's Ricky. I know you

178
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,519
know who I am." I said, "Palyamino,

179
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,758

180
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,680

235
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,639
Ray and Martha you know and she's

236
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,879
working with Snoop there's another way I

237
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,519
remember you know how they first met was

238
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,038
on the Justin Bieber roast and she was

239
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,560
sitting next to him and he started

240
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,120
smoking on the stage he was he was

241
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,439
smoking on never seen before smoking on

242
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,280
on the television show on a roast. He

243
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,279
adore it to the Grammys. We don't go to

244
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,799
Grammy but award shows, but he smoked on

245
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,478
that show. Then when she came went out

246
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,639
that they got close um really

247
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,240
conversating. Then then I guess after

248
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,680
she went in and came home, she decided

249
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
let me do a cooking show with him

250
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
because of his reputation and how he was

251
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,198
doing you know everything. So it turned

252
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,639
out good for them both. Turned out

253
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
really good for both of them. They cross

254
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
demographics. Everybody that's like a

255
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,639
Dr. Dre and Snoop with a cooking now.

256
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
Yeah. Seriously. Yeah. He understands

257
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
the collaboration model really well.

258
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,038
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's he's very

259
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,839
he's very adjustable to all type of

260
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:40,319
aspects. I watch him go from rag music

261
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,279
to hip-hop music, Snoop Lion, Snoop Dog,

262
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,760
you know, I watching Pimp and Snoop, you

263
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,759
know, just so many atmospheres of Snoop

264
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,360
that people don't really know about. And

265
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,799
me being his chef, but before I was a

266
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
chef, I was just a good friend, you

267
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,199
know, and he picked me out to be a chef

268
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,080
because, you know, I he I cooked for him

269
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
one time a long time ago. we uh with his

270
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
uncle June Bug. That's how he know I can

271
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,759
really cook. He first taste my food.

272
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,199
Some uh baked chicken. It was cold

273
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,720
outside. Yeah. So, we was going to get

274
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,560
on the grill. So, we had the chicken sit

275
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,399
in the refrigerator, party wings, and

276
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,919
nobody wanted to cook. You can't go

277
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,839
outside on the grill. So, nobody wanted

278
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,360
to cook. And he didn't want it fried cuz

279
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
so people let's bake it. I said, "Well,

280
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,879
let's bake it." Yeah. Nobody I ain't

281
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,119
baking that. I put in put in the oven

282
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,720
and baked it and oh yeah, this is good.

283
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
They clean the chicken out. They had

284
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
never ate my food ever since then. That

285
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,680
was like in like the late 90s or

286
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:32,559

347
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,399
stuff like that. Well, I think some of

348
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,599
that kind of regulate when you smoke a

349
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
lot of weed, you want to balance it out

350
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,000
with some sugar. I like caffeine, sugar,

351
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,240
and weed, but like I try to cut out the

352
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,600
sugar. Just the caffeine and the weed

353
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,919
work really well together, too. Okay.

354
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,120
So, how do you So, you grew up cooking?

355
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,000
You you started cooking when you were

356
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,278
young or when did you start cooking?

357
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,078
Yeah. Well, my great-grandmother, you

358
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,439
know, I was raised with my

359
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,799
great-grandmother. My mother was young

360
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,519
at the time she had me. You know, I'm

361
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,879
the firstborn. Um, so I was raised in a

362
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
house with my great-grandmother, my

363
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,799
grandmother, my uncles, aunties,

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
cousins, and stuff. Now, I'm the first

365
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,120
born in my generation. I'm only have

366
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,518
seven kids. Um, at the time I was first

367
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
only 15. So my great-grandmothers taught

368
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,560
me how to cook, both of them and my mom

369
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,079
as time went on, but my

370
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,319
great-grandmother was my influence of

371
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,000
cooking. Um, I first learned how to cook

372
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,120
was eggs. Everybody learn how to cook

373
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,799
eggs. That's the first thing you

374
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,560
scramble for what you're eating. Um, and

375
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,799
then as I grew up, I just love to cook.

376
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,119
I had a passion for cooking, but never

377
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,199
created a business. Never tried to open

378
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,600
up a restaurant, never tried to go sell

379
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,639
a plate or do nothing like um as I got

380
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,079
older, um my this just like older older

381
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,519
like in my late 30s. Um I start doing

382
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,599
backyard parties, like if we throw a

383
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,278
backyard party, somebody cooking, I go

384
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,959
help them. What they call now sue chef.

385
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,320
I didn't know then it was just I like

386
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,719
helping them cook and I end up taking

387
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
over the whole cook. Hey man, move out.

388
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,278
You don't know what you're doing. Get

389
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,720
out of the way. I was on the grill like

390
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,320
cooking for the homies and stuff and

391
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,800
then I look back and they start liking

392
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,440
my food. But I just see him smiling all

393
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,919
the places empty and people smile say

394
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,240
okay I can cook I can cook you know I

395
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,000
season a lot I like flavor but I don't

396
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,399
like salty flavor I don't like too much

397
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
spicy I like just right balance it out

398
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,159
and I learned how to balance it out but

399
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,519
just from experience my teacher learn

400
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,759
looking at other people's seeds and

401
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,120
stuff and taste my own experience and

402
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,958
see if it's too salty or not and I

403
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,679
learned how to balance that and and make

404
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,679
that kind of like less sodium healthier

405
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,120
for good people you know right and

406
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,559
that's that's And that's that's really

407
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
how I learned how to cook with my

408
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,239
great-grandmother. She's was my mentor

409
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,000
in cooking. The same thing my parents,

410
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,759
you know, I grew up with parents that

411
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,120
both like to cook. My mother was also a

412
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,759
baker, owned a bakery for a little bit

413
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,278
when I was younger. Um, you know, bread

414
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,480
baker. She used to make amazing bread,

415
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,720
but also, you know, everything from

416
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
croissants to cakes, all that stuff. And

417
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,639
then my father was friends with a

418
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,319
Michelin star chef. Okay. Sorry. Master

419
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,360
chef from France. This was, I think,

420
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,920
even before Michelin died. He was a

421
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Yeah. French master chef. Okay. and uh

422
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,559
by the name of Ken Wolf. And so my dad

423
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
took cooking classes from him. My dad

424
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,278
taught me how to cook. So by the time I

425
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,000
was 6 years old, I was in cooking

426
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,480
competitions. Okay. Okay. So yeah, I I

427
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,639
love cooking. And I The way you the way

428
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
you did that, like I would I mean when

429
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,198
you did that, I still to this day had

430
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,360
that vision. Um whenever I do cook for

431
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,120
somebody, um you know, cuz like I said,

432
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
I only cook for him. I never got a

433
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,879
chance to really cook like in the

434
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,600
setting what you did that day. Um I have

435
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,198
I've done it now know recently but

436
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
before I haven't done it. So when I seen

437
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,319
you do it I took ideas. I like ideas you

438
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,320
know. Um I like the cup the cup in the

439
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,399
martini cup with the potatoes and Yeah.

440
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
It's so fun. You just take a pastry bag,

441
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
pipe it in there. It's fun. People like

442
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,919
fun. Yeah. People like fun. And they

443
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,519
like the the way you steamed up the

444
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,039
marshmallow and the cracker. You know

445
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,198
the chocolate. Yes. We use the dab torch

446
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,799
dab torch s'mores. Yeah. Yeah. Dab torch

447
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,240
thing. Yeah. So you know Yeah. Put bacon

448
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,639
in the s'mores too. You know, it's like

449
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
all those little details and and that's

450
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,240
what personalizes it and makes it your

451
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,920
own. And I just love that kind of stuff.

452
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
You know, we we should do a dinner party

453
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,639
together here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm with

454
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
it. I'm with it, man. I'm with it. You

455
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,639
know, like I said, it's it's, you know,

456
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,799
now I see the bigger picture. Um, that's

457
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,159
why I created Cooking with Cubone show

458
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,958
to have fun and, you know, go around

459
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,039
doing reviews, not reviews. It's like a

460
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,039
diners and D like a guy, you know. He's

461
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,439
one of my favorite. Um, I like the way

462
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,599
he just hosted people and you know, you

463
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,279
barely see him cooking unless he's at

464
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,720
home or one of his restaurants back or

465
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,078
he's supporting it. But most time he's

466
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,839
supporting. He can cook though. That's

467
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,439
why people can cook. He can totally

468
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,800
cook. He can totally cook. He's also a

469
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,320
great host. And he's probably known more

470
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,240
for being a host than a chef and a

471
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,560
restaurant owner. But it's like Ramsay's

472
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
Kitchen. Ramsey, he's like the the drill

473
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,399
sergeant of the cooking guy. Loves

474
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,919
yelling at everybody. But yeah, and

475
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,759
Gordon Ramsay, one of my friends used to

476
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,679
work for Gordon Ramsay, and he said the

477
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,600
only time he heard Gordon Ramsay yell

478
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,039
when he worked for him was when he fired

479
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
somebody and that was it. It wasn't like

480
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,879
he was firing people. He took care of

481
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,000
his staff, you know? I I think he said

482
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,278
you he just make you want to get on

483
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,240
point, stay on point. He just let you

484
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,919
know your your smallest failure could be

485
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
the end of your career, you know? Yeah.

486
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,039
But he also doesn't hire idiots, right?

487
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,320
Those for for the shows, they put idiots

488
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,599
in front of him and then what happens?

489
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,440
He yells at them. You know what I mean?

490
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
But like guys like that, they can't

491
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
afford to have shitty people working for

492
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,879
them as a restaurant. As a restaurant

493
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,000
owner. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I think you got

494
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,838
like three or four. Yeah. A lot of

495
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,600
restaurants. Bobby Flavor is another one

496
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,360
I like too. I like Yeah. I like his

497
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
personality and his cuisine style is

498
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
good. Giata, she's another one. Like

499
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,758
Yeah. She's everywhere. She's

500
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,320
everywhere. She's all over the place,

501
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,839
too. With the grocery the grocery uh Oh,

502
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,759
yeah. shopping thing gang when they cook

503
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,800
in the parking lot and like I like and

504
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,000
know and I and I really wanted to um I'm

505
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,919
still thinking about going on one of

506
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,679
them shows like that one day creating

507
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,958
one of them contest someday somebody

508
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,719
will pull me on there and I just you

509
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,319
know whether win or lose is just I just

510
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,079
want to have that experience that I

511
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
cooked against Bobby Flave and stuff.

512
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,519
Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me know. I'll

513
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,199
train you for one of those events.

514
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,799
Exactly. Exactly. I'm big into those and

515
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,319
I used to win cooking competitions.

516
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,159
Right. And especially mystery basket

517
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,600
cooking competitions. I love those.

518
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,879
Right. And it's that's where you can get

519
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,640
really creative, but you have to have

520
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,160
just a base understanding for what you

521
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,600
can make. Like going into the

522
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,199
competition, you have an idea. Okay,

523
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,719
this is what you know it could be

524
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
potentially. And then you build off of

525
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
those ideas. But my signature dish um

526
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,520
where I grew up on is spaghetti. Yeah.

527
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,199
So I fig I looked at around um a lot of

528
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,918
African-American restaurants, soulful

529
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,640
restaurants. Spaghetti is made in every

530
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,959
household outside Italian. um in in our

531
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,038
way, you know, just regular ground beef,

532
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,960
spaghetti, tomato paste or piggo sauce,

533
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,038
regular sauce. But I thought of three

534
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,840
meats. I want to do my three meats. Bell

535
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,400
peppers, onions, you know, different

536
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,159
seasonings, K style. You know, I do

537
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,640
turkey. I do three meats of turkey. I do

538
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,880
a breakfast turkey, sausage with the gr

539
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,400
turkey ground with turkey sausage. And

540
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
then I put all the ingredients in my

541
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,200
special. Then I at the end I you know I

542
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,359
hit him with a little secret sauce like

543
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,679
why it's called a Cajun that's I'm not

544
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,279
Italian so I'm bringing you a barbecue

545
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,600
flavor sauce or Cajun style some

546
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,879
spaghetti with lots of flavor lots of

547
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,279
flavor make you think you was eating the

548
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,320
sofa and it works it works and everybody

549
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,240
I have fed it to have ate it um on tour

550
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,319
um you know I do cook for like the staff

551
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
on tour I cook enough for Snoop but also

552
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,359
cook enough for the eight or nine 10

553
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,600
other people on staff and sometime

554
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,519
guests and I had people came to me and

555
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,678
said like man I ate spaghetti in 8

556
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,599
years, man. Your spaghetti the bomb. So,

557
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,200
I I figured, okay, here I go. That's my

558
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,798
signature dish. I'm I'm going to make

559
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
sure everything I cook, I got spaghetti

560
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,038
at the menu because nobody really has

561
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,359
spaghetti on their menu in the way of I

562
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,240
made it. So, I've cooked for a lot of um

563
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,399
venues now. I cater to motorcycle clubs

564
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,000
and stuff to some of my friends. So, I

565
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
go to their little annuals or something

566
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,839
or one of their game nights and I go in

567
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,720
there with that spaghetti that Traers is

568
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,879
so easy to do with a salad or sweet roll

569
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,960
and I'm winning. man. And everybody love

570
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,679
it. I I have not one complaint yet. So I

571
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,360
said, "Okay, I'm going to stick to

572
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,400
spaghetti, right? Stick spaghetti." You

573
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,079
know, that that's my blow up right

574
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,840
there. Keep it simple. Keep it simple.

575
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,918
You know, you can fry if I can fry fish

576
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,918
and fry chicken or baked chicken or

577
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,840
barbecue chicken on a grill. It matches

578
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,600
with spaghetti, right? It's a full It's

579
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,879
a full-fledged platter, you know? Well,

580
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,079
I feel like cooking is a lot like

581
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,679
growing. You want to learn how to cook,

582
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,439
cook the same thing over and over and

583
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,798
over till you've perfected it instead of

584
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,558
trying to cook everything in the world

585
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,918
and switch it up. And you can follow

586
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,599
recipes to learn how to cook. But

587
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,520
eventually you you need to cook to

588
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,038
taste, right? To your own taste because

589
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,639
there's certain amounts of salt levels

590
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,000
that you want, you know, and everybody's

591
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
different. That's subjective, right? How

592
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
much salt is in there. Some people need

593
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,120
more, some people need less. Some people

594
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,558
like spicy, some people like not so

595
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,399
spicy. Some people don't like spice at

596
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:33,678
all. Yeah. Some people the older you get

597
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
that spice you got to take. I'm the

598
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,280
opposite. As I've gotten older, I like

599
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,720
more spice. I I would say in the last

600
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,000
two years since I do I started doing

601
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,000
this cold plunging, right? where you go

602
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,319
in the freaking freezing cold water for

603
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
3 to 5 minutes. And ever since I started

604
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,918
cold plunge, I I could eat spicier food.

605
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,919
Okay. And so this is just in the last

606
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,080
two years since we started doing the

607
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,919
podcast really that I've been able to

608
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,678
eat pretty spicy. Like I would never

609
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
mess with habaneros before. Now it's

610
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,759
like, oh, I eat habanero. It's not that

611
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,200
bad. Ghost peppers. Eh, it's a little

612
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,798
bit out of my league, right? Like

613
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,880
habanero. Yeah, that's that's big right

614
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,720
now. I don't know what what made that

615
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,240
come out because of the spiciness in it.

616
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,919
Yeah. Well, you know, it's like I I love

617
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
that habanero. Over the last couple

618
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,080
years, it's really like the household

619
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,440
name now. Uhhuh. Yeah. You see them at

620
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,918
Safeway everywhere. Everywhere. Yeah.

621
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,798
Every making off top of even even um

622
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,720
Chick-fil-A got made a version of it. Or

623
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,558
the ghost pepper too, you know. Yeah.

624
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,079
Ghost peppers, too. And scorpion is way

625
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,240
too hot. Like Yeah. That's way too hot.

626
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,879
That's way too hot. I had It's so hot

627
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,038
that I took one scorpion pepper with a

628
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,679
whole flat of strawberries, some sugar,

629
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,640
some acid, some some lemon juice, and I

630
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,600
made this sauce. And I had one pepper,

631
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,240
one of these scorpion peppers. And if I

632
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,558
eat it, like just a spoon, I just take a

633
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,319
little bit on a spoon and then to touch

634
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,399
it to my tongue, my my ears turn purple

635
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,038
cuz it's so spicy. Oh wow. Too spicy for

636
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,840
me. And a lady sent me um her name is

637
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,640
Marie Strat. She sent me like a hot

638
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,038
sauces. Maria. She's from Bise. She has

639
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,720
like I haven't even tasted all the hot

640
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,079
sauce. I'm not going to say, you know,

641
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,319
unless somebody come my house and they

642
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,558
want hot sauce. You got a choice to the

643
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,038
flame and super heap for heat. They like

644
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,119
she's at levels that I'm like like

645
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,879
Tabasco was too hot for me. Wow. So

646
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,918
imagine I'm just throwing Louisiana hot

647
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,960
sauce, crystal and other you know that

648
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,320
super super hot sauce. Oo. No. Then I um

649
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,000
the pepper. Yeah. Oh man, if that that

650
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,678
you know that just get me in a sweat

651
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,200
box. I turn to the sweat box. So you

652
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,600
know I limit myself on spicy seasoning I

653
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,840
can do. Yeah. Like you know like creole

654
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,119
casian all that just a dab of kayen.

655
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,439
Yeah. Black and different ones like

656
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,079
that. Yeah. But when it come when like

657
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,759
jerk I love jerk jerk. I just started

658
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,279
cooking jerk chicken like couple of

659
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,599
months ago in one of my friends house on

660
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,720
the holiday. Yeah. I like pounding out

661
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,319
chicken breast and doing them jerk

662
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,600
chicken style like that. So you pound it

663
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,119
with a hammer. I'll just Well, yeah. So

664
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,480
I'll take a I have a mallet and I'll

665
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,918
slice it thin and then I'll pound it

666
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
even thinner. I put the jerk seasoning

667
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,159
on both sides and I I grill it. Okay. I

668
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,360
love that. Like you can do the legs, you

669
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,120
can do the whole stuff. I think you're

670
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,279
doing the smash burgers now. Oh yeah, I

671
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,639
love smash burgers. That's my jam. So So

672
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,319
what's the different? I mean, I never

673
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
really get into it because I I just

674
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,759
thinking I just smash fat fat fat. It's

675
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,279
a smash burger. But you got to hit it

676
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,119
with the hammer. So what you got to do

677
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,879
with the smashburger is basically you

678
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:23,038
got to use 70% lean is the best. 80%

679
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
will work. 70 is the best. Okay. And

680
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,640
what you do is you take a you make your

681
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,919
ball a quarter pound ball, right? And

682
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
then you put it on the grill when it's

683
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,320
hot. It's got to be pretty hot. You

684
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,558
smash it down with with a I have a

685
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,079
smasher that's specifically cast iron.

686
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,798
We're smashing. It's round. It smashes

687
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,720
it down. Um smashes it in the burger

688
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,960
patty shape. You take it off. You put

689
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,640
your onions that are sliced thin. Salt

690
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,319
and pepper. And then what you do is you

691
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,480
just cook it till you can see the edges

692
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,079
starting to caramelize. You scoop under

693
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,558
it. You flip it over. You put your

694
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,240
cheese on it. Once the cheese is melted,

695
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,918
you know it's done. And so this is like

696
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,079
a a minute and a half, two minute

697
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,520
process. Your burger is done. As long as

698
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,038
your bun's already heated up, you just

699
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,319
put it on there. I use my own special

700
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,599
sauce. It's kind of like thousand

701
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,119
island, right? And I use pickles and

702
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,959
I'll I'll put a little bit of shredded

703
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,959
lettuce, but I love smash burgers, but

704
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,558
the the important part is the beef with

705
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,798
the smashed burgers and the bun, right?

706
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,558
It's like potato bun or bio. You can go

707
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,960
either way. They're both good. I prefer

708
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,798
bio myself. Okay. I just had one down at

709
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,159
Rip Pizzeria, the pizza and beer in uh

710
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,918
Orange County when I was there the other

711
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,600
day. They use the potato bun. It's the

712
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
best potato bun I've ever had. Okay.

713
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,959
Really conforms to the burger where you

714
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,120
can you can squeeze it. Right. Right.

715
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Right. Right. It's like potato burger.

716
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,558
Yeah. And you want that crispy. It's

717
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,159
almost crispy like bacon, but it's a

718
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,879
burger, you know. And I use American

719
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,039
cheese. I like they have a I think it's

720
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,480
a smoked American. Okay. Which is really

721
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,919
good. Or if you're really creative,

722
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,079
smoke your own American cheese and do

723
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,960
it. And how you smoke American? How you

724
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,918
smoke? A smoker. You

725
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,759
smoke cold smoked cheese. You put it in

726
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,120
a smoker. You do cold smoke. So it's

727
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,879
just the smoke and not the temperature

728
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,319
so it doesn't melt it. Yeah. And you get

729
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,400
all that flavor and then you do it as a

730
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,759
whole block. So when you slice it thin,

731
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,120
you just have it on the outside. So as

732
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,240
you're biting into it, man, that's

733
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,439
that's amazing. Yeah, that's tight.

734
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,120
That's I'm going to try that out. I'm

735
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,200
going to learn something every day.

736
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,199
Yeah. Yeah. I got all kinds of fun cook

737
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,840
a lot of people that you know the the

738
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,480
healthy eaters nowadays have caused most

739
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,480
chefs and most kitchens to serve food

740
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,159
with less flavor season unless you ask.

741
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,599
Remember, you have to ask, you have to

742
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,880
tell them, I don't want the season on

743
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,639
here. Now you have to tell them to put

744
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,159
the season on because they give you

745
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
straight blame food because they don't

746
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,960
know. They rather they looking at

747
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,798
health. They don't know your issues.

748
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,798
They don't want to underline you and you

749
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,158
go into a stage of hypotheria or

750
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:35,599
something like that while you eating

751
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,120
that food and it's so seasoned cuz you

752
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,918
know it's a lot of people I I had a

753
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,399
seasoning called Grandma Hands that my

754
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,720
auntie had created in Houston, Texas. It

755
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,278
was low sodium like you could put it on

756
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,200
potatoes, you could put it on any food

757
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,359
and you have to do nothing use nothing

758
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
allpurpose. You'll never use nothing

759
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,278
else on it. If you use anything else on

760
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,440
it, it was salty. Yeah. And I had people

761
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,919
that had like high blood pressure and

762
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,519
they would use that seasoning and they

763
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,799
would say, "Man, I can use that. Give me

764
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,879
order some more." I even had Chef's

765
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,319
Kitchen order. She know she just stopped

766
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,159
about a year ago. I'm trying to get her

767
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,158
to get it back, you know, back. But

768
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,760
she's elderly now and she just in her

769
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
own little world, you know, but I'm into

770
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,480
the real good the seasoning, the flavor.

771
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,200
Um, yeah, I like I like all allpurpose

772
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,480
seasoning. I'm just getting on Miss

773
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,120
Dash. Yeah, because it's not salty. It's

774
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
It's table blend. And I tried the lemon

775
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,158
pepper the other day. Now it's got

776
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,278
flavor. It brings flavor to the food.

777
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,360
What's your favorite barbecue sauce?

778
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,880
Mine's Kinder. I love Kinder. I love

779
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,918
Kinder. Everything, man. Now Kinders is

780
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,559
killing everybody right now. Come on.

781
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,480
You got roasted garlic now. You got hot

782
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,440
gold. They got a new wing sauce. Their

783
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,038
wing sauce is seen. Yeah. Yeah. Here we

784
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
do a lot of AB testing with plants,

785
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,038
right? So, we'll test this versus this

786
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,919
versus this with nutrients or with soil

787
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,359
versus cocoa versus whatever. I did that

788
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,440
with wings at the house. So, we did the

789
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,439
Kinder Wing Sauce versus the freaking

790
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,320
Crystal versus the Frank's Red Hot.

791
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,720
Okay. Kinders, their new wing sauce is

792
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:04,960
so good. It get I met um the son who

793
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,558
runs Kinder Justin. I met him through

794
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,159
E40 and Be Legit um years ago. And you

795
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,038
know, so yeah, me and them got real

796
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,200
close. And like I say, he he done added

797
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,960
more to the table than any other

798
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,319
barbecues I see right now. He's like

799
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,079
killing the game. But the one I say, I

800
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,599
can't think. He's got the he he's he's

801
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,918
in every store, too, though. He's But

802
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,918
he's based out of Atlanta. Oh, sweet

803
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,440
baby Ray. That's the old Sweet Baby,

804
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,360
man. Sweet Baby Ray. That's a classic.

805
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,600
That's a classic. I like that sweet and

806
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,879
spicy one, though, for sure. I like the

807
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,959
balance with that, you know. And it's

808
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,120
it's funny cuz my parents live in Texas

809
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,558
and Texas style barbecue sauce is a

810
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,359
little bit different. You got your

811
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,278
Kansas City barbecue sauce and then I

812
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,959
love the classic like like what Kinders

813
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,079
I love the the sauce they got there.

814
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,038
Killing the game right now. I just went

815
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,119
and bought something the other day the

816
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,480
roasted garlic. I like I love I love the

817
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,558
roasted garlic. I use that on my steak.

818
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,079
I I don't even use steak sauce, you

819
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,678
know. I use that on my all on my chicken

820
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:01,519
steaks. I I even use on my

821
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,320
taquitos, everything. I I even use that

822
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:07,038
like when when I make it my soups is

823
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,038
different stuff. I love that Kinders the

824
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,480
different flavors of they sauce. Yeah.

825
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,919
They kill the game, right? Kinder

826
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,960
barbecue sauce. They're spicy with

827
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,360
nachos is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

828
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,120
Spice with nachos. They That's what I

829
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,959
use it on. I use it as Kendra on my

830
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,798
nachos. I put it on the nachos and the

831
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120
cheese. I put everything else on it.

832
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,519
I'll put that lettuce on it and tomatoes

833
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,519
on top and I sprinkle that little thick

834
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,918
kinders in there. Boy, put that flavor.

835
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,400
Like you can really make a blade

836
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,000
hamburger. Yeah. And put nothing on it

837
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,600
and put that Kenders on it. You going to

838
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
get all the flavor out that sauce right

839
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,079
there. Secret to meatloaf is not just

840
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,079
ketchup. It's barbecue sauce. Have fun.

841
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,839
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do barbecue and I

842
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,918
do ketchup. Yeah, barbecue ketchup. I

843
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,918
mix mines. My Yeah. My girl, she she

844
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,038
loves that with just the ketchup and she

845
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,799
don't use barbecue sauce. She said, "You

846
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,879
eat barbecue sauce on everything.

847
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,240
Everything we have. You just barbecue

848
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
barbecue." I said, "Hey, that's where

849
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,079
the flavors at. I'm just Call me the

850
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
barbecue king eater." I like switching

851
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,240
it up. Yeah. I like I like it. Yeah.

852
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,919
Switch it. I I was trying Mr. Stubs,

853
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,159
too, though. But, you know, I don't

854
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
know. It like a Texas barbecue cuz you

855
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,120
got the cowboy hat. Black with the

856
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,038
cowboy hat on it being there. Stubs. So,

857
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,239
what what's the difference between like

858
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,000
I ate um Kansas City barbecue sauce? Uh

859
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,319
Gates. I remember Gates. I It's more

860
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
vinegary, right? It's more the the

861
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,918
Kansas City is more vinegary. More

862
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,919
vinegary. Yeah. Now, what is Texas is

863
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,919
more uh like more it's richer flavor.

864
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,919
Texas is this thick spicy stuff, right?

865
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz I had met a meat

866
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,038
company when I was on the road. We was

867
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,158
on tour. Um it's a meat company in

868
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:40,640
Texas. They do Wagu. Yeah. Burgers,

869
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,399
steaks, and everything. Um they doing

870
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,320
like 300 cows a week. Wow. 300 cows a

871
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,000
week. They're real big. And I love

872
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,359
barbecue though. Good barbecue. You

873
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,960
can't go off. Yeah. Yeah. You got The

874
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,959
only problem with most barbecue spots is

875
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,200
their sides suck, right? But but if you

876
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,759
go in there for me, the potato salad is

877
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,919
no good. The beans is no good. And I

878
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,038
love good beans. And I love good mac and

879
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,480
cheese. Like those are the things I

880
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,079
love, too. I probably eat those more

881
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,919
than I eat barbecue. Like mac and cheese

882
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,158
is something I I pride myself in my mac

883
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,080
and cheese, too. Oh yeah. I pride my Now

884
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,600
I make my mac and cheese different from

885
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:17,119
my my roommate. He uh my brother, he um

886
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,959
put me up on it. He instead of milk Mhm.

887
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,038
He uses cream mushroom. It comes out.

888
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,319
Oh, that's

889
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,398
different. Use cream of mushroom and it

890
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,678
Oh, man. It comes out. So like the pep

891
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,959
milk in the candy, you use cream of

892
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,519
mushroom. Yeah. Oh man, it it's it's

893
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,440
it's you got to try it. Nice. I I I'm

894
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,759
like now I don't even make it without

895
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,840
the cream of mushroom because it's also

896
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,960
melts the cheese, you know, and then the

897
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,639
cream mushroom, you know, it's thick.

898
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,038
Makes it creamy, too. Oh, it makes it

899
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,880
creamy, right? That it's on pl and it

900
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,440
has flavor. It gives you that cream of

901
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,278
mushroom flavor into the to the mac and

902
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,919
cheese. I do the truffle mac, right? So,

903
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,359
you put the truffle like we make I make

904
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,799
truffle oil from scratch, too, from real

905
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,639
truffles. And then we make I like the

906
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:59,359
Kender I like the Kender's truffle uh

907
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,360
steak truffle steak seasoning. Mhm. And

908
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,719
killing them. Like say Kender's not just

909
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,158
killing it with the sauce. He coming

910
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,679
with the seasoning. Yeah. And they got

911
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,120
the classic ball tip sandwich. That is

912
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,960
the best sandwich in the Bay Area is

913
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,759

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,759
other chefs have made the billionaire

952
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,278
bacon. There was the millionaire bacon

953
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,119
and then Snoop had the billionaire

954
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,519

00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,038
She was in Vegas with um she has the CBD

00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,079
change up the THC. So, I'mma collaborate

971
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,919
with her with doing that. And um I also

972
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,278
have a Stoner brand. You heard Stoner

973

974
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,720
called Chronic Tonic. Nice. And they

975
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,640
going to the final stages of getting

976
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,480

977
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,038
tasty cocktail. Yeah. Fruit cocktail.

978
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,120
It's right. It's real nice smooth just

979
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,480

different flavors and stuff, you know,

983
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,158
and everything. I love the way the

984
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,000
world's moving more towards cannabis

985
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,600
consumption than alcohol. Yes. Yes. You

986
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,798
know, and even like the alcohol, they're

987
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,000
making a cannabis style. It it has the

988
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,000
appearance of alcohol, but it's really

989
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,159
got cannabis in it. And and and you get

990
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,038
more about of it um healthwise. Um you

991
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,278
get you get more about it that you know

992
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,879
as far as taste, you know, because you

993
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,079
only taste THC and alcohol. You got

994
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,039
every other thing coming out of you

995
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:08,720
don't know what's in there. You know

996
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,759
what they doing. But I like the fact

997
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,759
that the THC cannabis is working its way

998
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,640
to America's land in the way we supposed

999
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,640
to. health, um, enjoyment, amusement,

1000
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,559
entertainment, and even in bar like the

1001
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,720
consump heard Governor Nuome pass the

1002
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,639
cons consumption lounge. Yeah. Really

1003
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,399
cool. I mean, I'm excited about that.

1004
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. So, when do I mean, is it in

1005
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,678
effect now that you can actually apply

1006
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,440
the law? I believe that people are

1007
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,600
already starting to apply for it. Yeah.

1008
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,640
I mean, I think it's going to be a big

1009
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,719
game changer, right, for I feel like the

1010
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,240
industry is suffering. It's great that

1011
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,399
we can have consumption lounges. I mean,

1012
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,558
I think that's that's just a necessary

1013
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,319
thing. They have There's no way you

1014
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,240
really look at it. You can go buy weed

1015
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,000
at any place and have nowhere to consume

1016
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,558
it but in your home. You can't stand

1017
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,720
outside. You can't be at a hotel. They

1018
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,079
don't have no place. Even if you have a

1019
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,440
business, you can't sit on the side with

1020
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,558
your business smoking. You might not

1021
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
want to smoke in the barber shop. You

1022
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:00,558
might not want to smoke it in a

1023
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,399
restaurant. You not want to smoke it in

1024
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,839
a bar a lounge. So, if you have a

1025
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,359
cannabis lounge like Aram does, nuh, now

1026
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,598
everybody has some place to go. And now

1027
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,279
the the profit of cannabis is starting

1028
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,639
to explode more, especially in all

1029
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,800
different ways with the drinks, the

1030
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,240
cocktails, the food, the different

1031
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,119
everything. Everything. Yeah. And I

1032
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,519
mean, and then you can have this

1033
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,280
consumption lounge that sells food. And

1034
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,759
now we got more money coming into the

1035
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,000
local, you know. Yeah. Exactly. More

1036
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,839
it's economical profit for any community

1037
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
comes in nowadays. I look forward to

1038
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,199
that. I look forward to that experience.

1039
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,760
I'm I'm going to try because, you know,

1040
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,158
my brother, he um owns a cannabis can of

1041
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,480
Oakland. Yeah. On 21st in MacArthur, you

1042
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,320
know. Um and we just built the outside.

1043
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,559
He built the outside. Um you know they

1044
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,639
got the booths on the sidewalk cuz co

1045
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,519
they had you outside. So he built a

1046
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,119
cemented booth on the sidewalk. Cemented

1047
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,800
brricked. Wow. You know most people

1048
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,159
build a will they can move it off and

1049
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,000
then probably they want to move. No,

1050
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,000
this is built on the ground now. Like

1051
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,280
it's not going nowhere. Yeah. Cuz in

1052
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,760
Oakland if you don't do that they're

1053
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,960
going to take it. That's how crazy it is

1054
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
out there in Oakland. So they want you

1055
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,480
to build something on the park on this

1056
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,598
curve. Yeah. Well, no. I mean, the thing

1057
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,440
is is if you don't, people are going to

1058
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,599
steal whatever it is cuz Oakland's just

1059
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,559
rough right now. Yeah, it is. It is. It

1060
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,240
is. And drink MacArthur. MacArthur was

1061
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,759
right there where he's at is it's kind

1062
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,199
of I liked it right there down there cuz

1063
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,640
I love Oakland. I love the city of

1064
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:22,319
Oakland. Um Frisco, I experienced Fris,

1065
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,639
but Frisco reminds me of New York,

1066
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,480
congested, and you just can't figure it

1067
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,400
out. It's like, you know, you can't you

1068
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,639
can't figure it out really of Frisco.

1069
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,680
Oakland is still historical. He still

1070
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,519
have his culture from the 60s attitude.

1071
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,480
The houses are still the same. The old

1072
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,599
school people. Yeah. Yeah. You got

1073
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,679
Berkeley right there. They're still

1074
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,599
out mounts of bar lounges and food

1075
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,358
places and every background that you can

1076
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,880
see in Oakland, you know. So, I love

1077
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,000
Oakland. I love Oakland. I have enough

1078
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,280
complaint about Oakland. Both cities

1079
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
have a special place in my heart. The

1080
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,040
whole Bay Area, you know. It's like I

1081
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,119
remember going to San Francisco to hate

1082
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,358
street partying back in the days,

1083
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,680
tripping on psychedelics. Yeah. We also

1084
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,519
do that in Berkeley. Uh but yeah,

1085
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,919
Oakland is just, you know, I've I've

1086
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,599
lived in Oakland on and off throughout

1087
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,519
my life, too. So, like we we've had

1088
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,119
houses, we've stayed in Oakland. We that

1089
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,639
grows in Oakland, all that stuff. I was

1090
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,320
a chef in Oakland. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1091
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,598
Yeah. I love Oakland. I love I just, you

1092
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,359
know, just hate the bipping. They they

1093
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,480
tanked out. But, you know, when you But

1094
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,880
when you know, I think what made people

1095
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,880
more in Oakland and do the bipping is

1096
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,559
because social media hyped it. Yeah. And

1097
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,480
now you got copy. They changed the laws,

1098
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,279
right? So they said anything less than

1099
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,039
900 and whatever dollars is is they

1100
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,400
won't even they'll issue a ticket,

1101
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,759
right? Rather than arrest you, you don't

1102
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,079
get arrested, you just get served a

1103
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,599
ticket. That's the problem. I think San

1104
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,519
Francisco's now changed that laws and

1105
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,519
it's the places aren't getting robbed.

1106
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,880
So I was in New York um years ago and I

1107
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,320
was cooking for somebody. I went to go

1108
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,320
to the store. I needed some butter.

1109
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,838
Yeah. I went to a little little market

1110
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,000
and they got a little Marcus, real

1111
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,880
little small Marcus. And I went to

1112
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,639
market and I um get some butter and it

1113
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,559
wasn't none. I said I asked the lady at

1114
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,440
the store um you have any butter in the

1115
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,199
back or something? Because there's no

1116
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,320
butter. I I never seen a store without

1117
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,000
the butter gone, you know. Yeah.

1118
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,760
Seriously. Like it's got to be who you

1119
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,920
ran out of butter. Who does that? You

1120
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,599
know. Um she said oh no they didn't came

1121
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,559
and stole the butter. I said they

1122
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,559
selling butter now? She said yeah and we

1123
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,639
don't stop them. I said why? She said

1124
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,000
because they told us that we're not

1125
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,199
supposed to intervene with the thieves

1126
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,880
and that's why they come and say and the

1127
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,159
police is not coming out. So they been

1128
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,838
did this in New York. They were doing

1129
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,319
this years ago. Then I start seeing

1130
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,838
years ago start here like oh wow we run

1131
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,599
our store now. So they not they're not

1132
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:35,838
really coming and then they promote it.

1133
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,838
They let you know in the news and the

1134
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,679
law they're not coming out for this and

1135
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,679
that trespassing homeless in front of

1136
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,679
your store. I hope no they're not coming

1137
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:44,960
to move that you know. Come on now. You

1138
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,480
going to make people take matters in

1139
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,599
their own hands and that's when you find

1140
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,920
vigilantes start growing and stuff like

1141
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,599
that you know. So yeah I seen a lot of

1142
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,440
we could use a Batman right about now

1143
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,599
man. We can use a Batman, Robin, and

1144
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,039
Captain America. Seriously, we can use

1145
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,119
all the superheroes to come back,

1146
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,358
including ourselves, to actually do what

1147
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,440
they got to do right now because it's

1148
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,880
it's it's a grace. It's disgrace, man. I

1149
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,800
I was looking at the Martin Luther King

1150
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,160
parade yesterday in LA and the

1151
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,240
youngsters is fighting out there and

1152
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,598
they quick to post it on social media,

1153
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,039
right? And you see the police responding

1154
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,960
to it, but instead of cuffing the

1155
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,880
youngsters um of the to the payment,

1156
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,760
they pushing them. Oh, wow. because they

1157
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,240
don't want the backlash of of their

1158
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,920
parents saying, "Hey, you pushed on my

1159
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,159
you grabbed my kid and Sam to the ground

1160
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,760
and hog tied him or some they going to

1161
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,598
bring up some respiratory problem or

1162
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,599
something." So now the law enforcement

1163
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,599
just suppression. They just pushing them

1164
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,760
out the way. And when they push and when

1165
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,760
they push them out the way, they going

1166
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,240
away. They're not going to jail. No

1167
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,680
consequences. Yeah. That makes it again

1168
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:49,039
and again and again and again until

1169
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,039
somebody the consequence is only going

1170
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,320
to be if they do go to jail or something

1171
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,239
else happened. over that should have

1172
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,800
happened but then again when they don't

1173
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,239

00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,199
saying that well they wasn't doing that

1177
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,199
and then you show on social media so

1178
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,719

00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,919
them go continue doing mischievous type

1252

on the devil's playground and he don't

1264
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,119
play games. You know, the biggest trick

1265
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,960
he ever pull in the world to make

1266
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,960
everybody believe he don't exist or he

1267
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,079
don't believe such negative. Well, if

1268
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,159
you don't believe in devil, then you

1269
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,760
don't believe in God. Yeah. Straight

1270
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,039
out. If you believe in God, you should

1271
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,640
believe in the devil because right is

1272
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,239
right and wrong is wrong. Yeah. And

1273
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,078
there's two sides to every story. Just

1274
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,479
like love spelled backwards is evil.

1275
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,119
Yeah. Spell love backwards. It's e v o

1276
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,358
l. Yeah. Yeah. So, do you grew up in the

So when I moved up here they greeted me.

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,559
years, you know. I'm Bay LA. Yeah. And

1314
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,079
LA's special, too. It's got its own

1315
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,679
thing. I like visiting LA, but I

1316
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,440
couldn't live down there. The traffic,

1317
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:22,078
it's just different vibe. I'm more I'm a

1318
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,599
more of a NorCal vibe sort of guy. So,

1319
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,359
we're working on these pre-rolls. You

1320
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,359
You're testing some of the new ones. I

1321
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,559
like the glass tips. I first started

1322
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,199
smoking we you know, Snoop, that's where

1323
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,639
he smoked them glass tips. Um, a lot of

1324
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,399
people wonder where you get them glass

1325
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,400
tips came from. Real started those. The

1326
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,838
funky field tips. That was the original.

1327
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,680
The flat ones. I like the flat ones.

1328
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,838
Yeah, they kind of good. Who they had

1329
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:45,279
them on blunts and loose? Um Louis the

1330
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:47,039
13th. Yeah, Louis OG. Louis 13. I love

1331
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,240
Louis the 13th. That's my buddy, man. A

1332
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,519
good friend of mine. And that's, you

1333
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,358
know, a lot of people was saying, uh

1334
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,039
man, somebody whose roles for Snoop, who

1335
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,960
rolls for Snoop and Snoop does this for

1336
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,639
Snoop and Snoop pays this person this

1337
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,318
role thing? They would ask me every day,

1338
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,559
is you is you doing that? No, I don't. I

1339
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:05,480
barely know how to roll. I I wrote

1340
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:08,799
something really come up short.

1341
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,480
Um Louis 13. Yeah, that's a good one.

1342
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,160
Well, that's what he co that that's he

1343
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,159
smokes that. So he'll bring them already

1344
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,920
pre-rolled up in a little gold package

1345
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,440
and let's box. You know, he come to box

1346
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,720
eight in the box. So he would bring

1347
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,480
Snoop a whole bunch of them already

1348
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,399
rolled up. Snoop have to roll them.

1349
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,400
Nice. And he just light them up. Light

1350
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,480
them up. Light them up. And wow. That's

1351
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,000
where you know a lot of people got the

1352
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,358
idea who's rolling. They didn't figured

1353
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,199
out because you don't be around Snoop.

1354
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:35,199
You wouldn't know it. Snoop know how to

1355
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:37,519
roll. Um, but he's homeed in on a lot of

1356
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,919
Louis the 13 for years. He smoked Louis

1357
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,239
He smoked Louis OG. He smoked Louis 13.

1358
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,519
That Louis OG is classic. That's toxic.

1359
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,279
He's He's He's everywhere. He's

1360
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,679
everywhere. He'll throw the weed out the

1361
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,400
window. Yeah. Yeah.

1362
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,480
So, tell me a classic story uh with from

1363
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,318
when you were on tour with Snoop. Uh, I

1364
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,960
mean it's really one of my classic

1365
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,119
stories with Snoop is before the tour

1366
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,318
cooking. Uh, before I got to cooking for

1367
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,720
Snoop because I went on tour with him in

1368
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:08,719
2005. Um, how the West One was tour um

1369
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:10,879
and that was my first experience

1370
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,519
um on tour with another artist on his

1371
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,280
tour and I did a single with him. Um,

1372
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:20,000
one of my most classic experience with

1373
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:22,400
Snoop had to do with Suge. Um, you know,

1374
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,318
um, defro had You had to get a sample

1375
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,000
clearance to use certain songs samples

1376
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,838
of certain songs. So we had bought this

1377
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,239
song uh the company I was working with

1378
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,880
called Bogar Music at the time 2005 had

1379
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,039
an artist name and they sampled a song

1380
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,720
called Snoop Dog J and Juice by Cry Dry

1381
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,400
Y Cry. So they had to go to Sil Knight

1382
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:41,919
to get that sample. By that time Snug

1383
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,400
Knight had to publishing for Dog Death

1384
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,838
Real Music. So he was him and Snoop was

1385
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,760
getting to it. So you know he wasn't

1386
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,480
talking so he wasn't releasing none of

1387
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,240
the songs to nobody. Um, and we had

1388
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,318
bought the song. We had bought the verse

1389
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,399
from Snoop to get on the song with him.

1390
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,800
So, we let let's get on the song. Um,

1391
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,358
but nobody Suge would not release that

1392
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,200
song to the nobody. Wow. So, everybody

1393
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,559
knew I knew Suge and that's how I met

1394
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,559
Snoop Dog. Actually, through Suge

1395
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,880
Knight, me introduced me to Snoop in '

1396
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,679
92 doing the gang truth and me and

1397
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,880
Snoopy got close in jump 96. I started

1398
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,440
working with the rapper artist Mystic

1399
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,599
out of New Orleans and that's how I got

1400
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,760
close with Snoop. Then he assigned to

1401
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,519
Master P. Yeah. I'll be with Mystical

1402
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,599
and he'll see Master P and he like, "Hey

1403
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,119
man, you up here. You everywhere." I

1404
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,960
said, "Oh yeah, I'm just like you, man."

1405
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,640
This he just starting his career off

1406
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,679
there. Um then up jumped in 2005, uh

1407
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:36,639
when he's Snoop Dog doing his thing, um

1408
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,719
he Snoop Lion and this and that. I had

1409
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,000
to get the song clear. They got to me to

1410
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,480
get the song clear. So I went to Suge

1411
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,239
Knight and got the song clear. Wow. And

1412
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,559
believe it or not, Suge Knight cleared

1413
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:49,679
the song for nothing. Nice. He didn't

1414
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,920
charge us nothing. He he he did it I

1415
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,639
think because he wanted to show that you

1416
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,039

Wow. And it blew up. Blew up. And we

that song cleared and I did something

1433
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,880
nobody couldn't do. Whether it was the

1434
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,560
label asylum or the label Snoop or they

1435
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,240
influence anybody influence in the

1436
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,719

1439
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,118
even a penny. Wow. Not even a penny.

1440
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,480
Really cool. Yeah, that was my I think

1441
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,358
that was my most

1442
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,280
experience working with him because once

1443
00:47:53,358 --> 00:48:00,400
I got that cleared, we did the video.

1444
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:03,119
Yeah. We went on tour song and on tour

1445
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,280
um when we was on that tour, one of the

1446
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,838
most one of the most iconic things that

1447
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,480
happened

1448
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:13,838
um is we was in Seattle performing and a

1449
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,079
guy ran on stage and hugged Snoop and

1450
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,920
boy that's a kid came everywhere and I

1451
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,680
was out I was on the bottom floor on the

1452
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,240
front floor and it happened to be a

1453
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:25,279
handicapped dude sitting in a wheelchair

1454
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:28,000
in small like a chair one of them he

1455
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,079
really paralyzed and he was smoking and

1456
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,599
Snoop has a joint to me the blunt to

1457
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,359
pass to. That's why I do I would be down

1458
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,760
there, you know, passing a blunt to the

1459
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:38,159
crowd cuz I'm a road manager so I'm not

1460
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,160
really have to be any place. I can be

1461
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,838
anywhere. So I chose to be on the front

1462
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,679
row, you know, pass through the fans,

1463
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,440
seeing the fans, reaction to the show.

1464
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,039
I'm a people's person. I like I go out

1465
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,280
the audience, they see me out there like

1466
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,239
wait my way out there, you know, Snoop

1467
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,720
see me out there like I go past them. So

1468
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,399
when I seen that happen, I jumped up on

1469
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,480
stage and ran up there. I pulled the

1470
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,240
dude off the stage. They wouldn't get

1471
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,599
beat up and you know, hey, what are you

1472
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,118
doing? You know, how you get up here?

1473
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,280
What's wrong with you? You know, you

1474
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,119
know, so that right there was one of the

1475
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,880
most

1476
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:13,119
like econic and classic situation with

1477
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,720
Snoop and me, you know, to be there for

1478
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,039
him, you know what I mean? And then for

1479
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:20,318
him years later to come back and be and

1480
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:22,400
recognize that from 2005 to 2016, we

1481
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,079
were just cool. Um, never did nothing

1482
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,000
else on tour. I backed over being there

1483
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,760
with the artist and went home. Yeah. And

1484
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,079
had me a child care center and I was

1485
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,920
working at home then with my family

1486
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,240
because I was going to roll from 96 to

1487
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,559
all the way to 2006

1488
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:40,799
on the road in music, you know, 92 to

1489
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:42,640
200 92 to 96 I was doing nonprofit in

1490
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,640
the community. Had a nonprofit program

1491
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,078
today gang intervention program. So I

1492
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:47,199
know how to stop the violence. I know

1493
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,720
how to deal with the kids in the

1494
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,480
streets. When I'm talking I'm just

1495
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,159
talking out of reading the book. I'm

1496
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,760
talking from my experience like my name

1497
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,078
rang a bell in the streets at

1498
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,839
peacemaker. My name rang a bell

1499
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,160
reputation in the streets being who I

1500
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,039
was before peace, you know, diffusing

1501
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,799
the situation. Yeah. Yeah. Diffusing the

1502
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:06,800
situation, stopping the situation,

1503
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,240
building a solutions more than anything

1504
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,039
else. So that situation won't have to

1505
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:13,439
come back because you can't replace

1506
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,719
something with nothing. Yeah. You can't

1507
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,400
tell a person to leave a corner, you

1508
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:17,439
going to give him something. Mhm. And a

1509
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,639
I'm not talking about to give him

1510
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,318
something to eat cuz he going to go back

1511
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,838
to that corner. Yeah. Yeah. And if he ad

1512
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:23,358
mentally not right, you can't give him a

1513
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,920
job because he's going to mess the job

1514
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,598
up. Yeah. So you have to send him to get

1515
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,760
help first and stuff like that, you

1516
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,838
know. So yeah, you know, so yeah, my

1517
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,040
history goes a long ways in these

1518
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:37,759

So, you know, I wear many hats when it

1538
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,960
comes to peace cannabis. I never know

1539
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,400
how to grow. I just know how to smoke. I

1540
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,159
just barely learn how to look at weed

1541
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,760
and tell the difference of what weed is

1542
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,399
a certain weed is. You know, I was just

1543
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,280
a consumer versus smoking weed. I I

1544
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,720
really didn't even smoke weed. One of my

1545
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,079
best friends got me to smoke weed when I

1546
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:39,279
came home back in 1989. Yeah. I said,

1547
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,119
"Well, I was smoking no weed. I didn't

1548
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,720
like weed." He said, "No, man. I smoke

1549
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,039
weed, man. It humble you out. Come on,

1550
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,239
man. You hanging with us. You look at

1551
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,000
yourself in the mirror differently for

1552
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,159
sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I said, "Okay,

1553
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,358
you're right. You're right." Hey, I

1554
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,598
growing up I didn't really smoke weed

1555
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,558
cuz otherwise I would get in trouble. So

1556
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,160
when I did like 16, 17,

1557
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,920
um I snug and did it, but I still

1558
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,598
respected my great grandmother. Yeah.

1559
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,760
Then when I went to jail, came home as

1560
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,920
an adult, my grandma passed, I still

1561
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,319
respected my mother. Like to this day,

1562
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,079
mother rest in peace, but even with my

1563
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:14,800
mother right now, I wouldn't u smoke

1564
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,800
around her. I it just I don't feel

1565
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,800
comfortable doing that. Even if I was

1566
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,039
around your parents, I you know, it's

1567
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,800
just a little that's something that's a

1568
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,079
kid is not going to leave you. It's not

1569
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,599
going to leave you to respect your

1570
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,119
parents or your elders. Yeah. I don't

1571
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,119
smoke in front of my parents. I'll go

1572
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,318
I'll go outside and smoke but I'm not

1573
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,838
going to smoke in front of them. I'm not

1574
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:33,279
like that. You know, a lot of people be

1575
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:34,318
doing hit the pen in front of my

1576
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,839
parents. You know what I mean? It's just

1577
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,079
not me, right? That's just it's a

1578
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,920
respect thing. And I think for being a

1579
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,640
older, you know, older now, now that

1580
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,039
we're older people, we're not old yet,

1581
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,400
but we're older. Yeah. Right. But we we

1582
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:48,000
have a different level of respect for

1583
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,000
our parents, for than a lot of the

1584
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,480
younger people do. And there's some that

1585
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,920
that are, you know. Yeah. Yeah. That are

1586
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,880
still respectful. And there's some

1587
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,880
really good young kids, young people.

1588
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,880
But yeah, but it's a different world. So

1589
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,400
Ricky Palamino, when he came on here, he

1590
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,000
talked about being in New Zealand, how

1591
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,639
he almost got arrested for weed with

1592
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,079
Snoop and almost took the fall, got in

1593
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:09,759
trouble. There were cops were going to

1594
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,839
arrest him if Snoop smoked on stage and

1595
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,240
then he smoked. Do you guys ever get in

1596
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:16,318
trouble? Even at the times, like I said,

1597
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,919
I've been on road with him since 2005.

1598
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,679
Yeah. Actually, that's when that first

1599
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,920
tour I went with Snoop on the road and

1600
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,279
got to know Snoop, start smoke, how we

1601
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,960
doing everything. Me too. We smoking

1602
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,160
weed. Yeah. It wasn't legal. So, you

1603
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,920
know, you had to just make it different.

1604
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,759
But, but the cities all embrace new

1605
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,680
pretty good, I think. Yeah, they do.

1606
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,200
They do. Yeah. Some Yeah, they I mean,

1607
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,199
they did then because, you know, back

1608
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,358
then it wasn't no $200 thing on the

1609
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,118
road, you know. It wasn't none of that,

1610
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,279
you know. It's that you just don't

1611
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,039
smoke. You know, you smoke a cigarette.

1612
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,920
You smoke cigarettes, they didn't care.

1613
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,480
You know, no weed problem. That's what

1614
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,000
really shopping because, you know, he's

1615
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,000
willing to pay for it like right now.

1616
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,318
Yeah. It ain't no ain't no if and buts

1617
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,318
about it. Yeah. It's smoking going on in

1618
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,719
his room in the hotel. No, they can say

1619
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:02,079
they go they like they tell you find you

1620
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:04,558
500. He go 500. Good smoking. Yeah. He

1621
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,800
go 500. Stop smoking. Right. But they

1622
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,280
it's bigger than just one little room

1623
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,200
with me as a Snoop. He's coming to you

1624
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,119
say he's bringing you customers. Yeah.

1625
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,519
And he's and he can take away your

1626
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,000
customers if he boycott this hotel. I

1627
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,838
bet. Yeah. You know what I mean? So it's

1628
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,519
like a battle between them cuz I mean

1629
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:22,880
it's like Thunder Valley. Yeah. They're

1630
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,440
not playing about you smoking a weed in

1631
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,680
Thunder Valley, right? What? We was

1632
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,519
smoking all down. It was smoke. It was

1633
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,000
going down. But you can smoke

1634
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,000
cigarettes, right? You can smoke

1635
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,920
cigarettes all day long at a casino and

1636
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,599
all that. Way worse for you as far as

1637
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,159
way worse for you. You know, Hollywood,

1638
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,559
you can't smoke cannabis on the streets,

1639
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,318
but you can smoke cigarettes. Yeah.

1640
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,480
Yeah. That's going to change. Yeah. You

1641
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,519
know, um No, you could you can smoke

1642
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,800
cannabis in Hollywood, but not

1643
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,639
cigarettes. Not cigarettes on the

1644
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,400
street. That's That's okay. Hollywood.

1645
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,480
Hollywood is like cannabis friendly.

1646
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,960
Yeah. That's why they um you know that's

1647
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,480
there's a lot of places in LA that look

1648
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,480
the other way when it come to that. I've

1649
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,880
seen happen here too. New York you can

1650
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,199
smoke freely. I just did New York Times

1651
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,920
Square cooking for Wonderramama TV and I

1652
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:09,199
smelling cannabis. So I look back and

1653
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,240
Yeah. You can smoke on the streets. No

1654
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,679
problem. And they're right there. The

1655
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,039
police right there next to the police.

1656
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,960
He just a blow. They used to be the

1657
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,400
worst before. They used to be the worst.

1658
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,199
Yeah. And they had the right to stop and

1659
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,000
frisk you. They used to be the worst.

1660
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:24,558
And I had a friend of mine um good

1661
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,440
friend of mine long time ago um this is

1662
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:32,079
like maybe n maybe early 2000s um he got

1663
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,079
caught with a joint coming through the

1664
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,400
Las Vegas airport they banned it for 6

1665
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,039
months. Wow. I even come back to Vegas

1666
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,559
for a joint. And Las Vegas is fully

1667
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:41,920
legit now. They got dispensaries all

1668
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,519
over. They've really embraced the

1669
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,358
cannabis. I feel like they need more

1670
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:47,280
smoking lounges there. But like the They

1671
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,119
do. They do. I mean they they do because

1672
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,880
you can't smoke nowhere. No. You you

1673
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,838
know you you can't smoke outside on the

1674
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,160
sidewalk. You can't smoke in the hotel.

1675
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,798
So you know so if you have a really big

1676
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:01,039
suite, you could smoke weed all you want

1677
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:03,199
on the balcony. Well, no smoking the the

1678
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,558

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,400

1692
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,280

1693
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,119

1694
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,160

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,599
smoking so much in there that the alarm

1696
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,279
went off in the room. I thought the

1697
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,039
whole hotel went off, you know, cuz it's

1698
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,880
got the flash in the room. It was just

1699
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,679
in the room. We just flashed it. But

1700
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,519
it's smoked out. They had to bring the

1701
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:54,798
big fan in there. I said, "We going to

1702
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,480
kick us out. They going to kick us out

1703
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,079

man. Y'all smoking too much, man. Kind

1705
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,119
of take it easy, cut the fan on, left

1706
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,798
two fans in there to to blow the smoke

1707
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,000
out, right?" And they did not find us

1708
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,000
another. That's when I said, "You know

1709
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,159
what? You that's a trip. You can smoke

1710
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,838
in these big old suites and get away

1711
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,358
with it. Ain't no ventilation going out

1712
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,039
here. Then you got a little room where

1713
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:17,279
you can, you know, flip the little

1714
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:20,159
window out, try to blow out the window

1715
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,559
or they come and find any tobacco. Yeah.

1716
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,078
Loose tobacco wrapped up in a napkin. In

1717
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,119
a trash can, they going to say you

1718
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,359

1719
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,200
around like Yeah. Don't throw no napkin

1720
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,639
in the trash can. They'll take that

1721
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,000
napkin out the trash can, open up, and

1722
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:35,759

1723
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,440

1724
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,520
smoked the tobacco because it's just

1725
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,679
broke down. It's not smoking. It's not

1726
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,358
ashes. It's no ashtray. Ma'am, I took I

1727
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,440
broke it down and rolled my cannabis and

1728
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:47,119
I went downstairs to smoke, right? But

1729
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,798
because it's on your clothing, when you

1730
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,960
come back, the scent is in the room.

1731
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,199
They figure it got on the curtain. So

1732
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,880
that's it. They got to find you. It's a

1733
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:57,598
It's a business of make they're in the

1734
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,440
business of making money on all $500

1735
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,160
every time. I just seen that all weekend

1736
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,000
the other night at the Hilden Garden

1737
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,318
reveal. $500. I said, "Oh yeah, [ __ ] I

1738
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,838
won't be smoking them in here." Yeah. No

1739
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,079
way. I don't even smoke. Matter of fact,

1740
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,199
I just wait till I left. Right. And then

1741
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,280
when I didn't come back for a couple

1742
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:14,960
hours, I just smoked and uh So if you

1743
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,359
have one piece of advice for your

1744
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,440
younger self, what would that one piece

1745
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:22,239
of advice be? I would go back when I was

1746
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,119
15 years old with my younger self. Yeah.

1747
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:27,679
And when I I would say street life, I

1748
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,559
would have took the way I did take it.

1749
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:33,440
Gang banging. Yeah. Some of the things I

1750
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:36,798
did, activities that I applied myself

1751
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,838
to. Mhm. Um I would told my younger self

1752
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,920
not to do that. attest to these 15 year

1753
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:44,159
olds and 13 year olds today. Yeah.

1754
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,159
Because at that age, you make a decision

1755
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:50,798
to step into a whole

1756
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:56,440
different life as a teenager to a grown

1757
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:59,199
teenager because you at for 15 you

1758
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:02,240
become that young adult almost because

1759
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:04,879
18 you tend to do things before you get

1760
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:07,199
21 preparing you for 21, right? That

1761
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,240
three threeear cycle and everything age.

1762
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,078
So 12 to 14, you're all right. Yeah. 15

1763
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:13,759
to 16, you better wake up. It's sort of,

1764
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,440
you got a decision to make. You going,

1765
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,359
you know, you take your training wheels

1766
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,039
off your bike. You You can go home. You

1767
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:21,358
go to school by yourself now. You know,

1768
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:23,000
enough to be dangerous. Yeah. You know,

1769
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,960
so I would tell my

1770
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,719
15-year-old, stick to the positive

1771
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,039
things in life. Take advantage of

1772
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,879
education in school. Take advantage of

1773
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,558
your religious belief. If you ain't in

1774
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,240
peace with God, keep it peace back then.

1775
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,400
cuz that back then you didn't have no no

1776
