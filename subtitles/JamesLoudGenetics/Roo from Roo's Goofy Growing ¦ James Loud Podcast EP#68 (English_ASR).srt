eight months uh you've been sharing a

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,799
lot of content online that's how we met

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,600
was Instagram yeah yeah I mean that's uh

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,479
like I said I really honestly I didn't

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,200
know about you until I started growing

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,558
and some dude turned me on your genetics

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,120
and uh I just had great success with

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,640
them and I I love them right off the bat

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,359
uh there's other things other ones I've

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,399
tried there were finicky and this and

23
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:56,359
that and um the first ones I got from

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,719
you somebody gifted to me and there was

25
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,840
those frosted biscottis and they thought

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,960
they were photo periods so I grew them

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,478
like I do with my photo period in a Solo

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,000
Cup and they were about this tall or so

29
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,959
and I saw a couple of them started

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,319
flowering I was like oh these are not

31
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,639
photo periods this dude that gave them

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,399
to me was mistaken uh but I transplant

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,799
him in time and that's one of the only

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Auto flowers I have ever had success

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,159
transplanting ever yeah ever two of them

36
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,839
didn't really make it or one of them

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
didn't make it one I kept in the Solo

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,280
Cup uh but those are the only olif

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,799
flowers I've ever got to transplant any

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,478
other olif flower I've tried

41
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,759
transplanting has always died uh or they

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,158
stay small or yeah not even die they

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,079
just I've had the struggle to I mean

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,159
I've I've learned how to do it with you

45
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,000
can transplant them as long as you

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,359
transplant them early enough if they if

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,319
the roots catch it all you're that it's

48
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,319
it's over they stay small they never get

49
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,798
big no yeah you got be Auto AO whis

50
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,798

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,840
Autoflower whisper for sure yeah yeah so

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
I do all my autof flowers in the my

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,560
hydro buckets and they just they thrive

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,359
in that so I love it yeah so that

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
frosted biscot special we didn't even

56
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,038
start selling until just recently I

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,800
wanted to thoroughly test it and you

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,318
sent some amazing photos we've had a

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239

really cool photos yeah it just comes

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,878
out really Frosty I mean I think most

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,919
people don't think of it as an

63
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,039
Autoflower when it's finished yeah no I

64
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,119
mean I know in all my videos I've always

65
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:26,878
said when I said frosted biscotti I said

66
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,680
that is the the perfect name for it cuz

67
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,560
you won't believe how many triones pack

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,120
on this thing you know for an Autoflower

69
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,080
it is insane like I've I've grown all

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
everything I've grown for you from you

71
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,519
is autoflowers and I everybody I give it

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,719
to is does not believe that they're

73
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,560
autoflowers they think that I'm lying to

74
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,199
them or something just can't believe it

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,640
so I'm having great success with your

76
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,000
autof flowers I appreciate that because

77
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,479
it's helping me out you know what I'm

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,560
saying awesome yeah dude I I love autof

79
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,598
flowers just as much as I love photo

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,158
periods I I don't discriminate

81
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,839
especially with autof flowers I think

82
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,639
that they've gotten so much better I

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
mean you look at my stuff but even some

84
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,878
of the other guys out there that are

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,199
producing really amazing stuff it's like

86
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:10,840
you didn't see anything like that 10

87
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,919
years ago yeah no I mean that's what

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,280
I've heard I'm not I haven't been

89
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,798
growing for 10 years uh but yeah I've

90
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,158
tried other ol flowers and so I kind of

91
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,719
see what they were saying you know what

92
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,679

bad turbs you get the yeah so yeah when

95
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,560
I was kind of I was totally going to

96
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,238
switch from autof flowers which I mean I

97
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,199
did I did photo periods but once I got

98
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,878
my hands on yours um it kept all the

99
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,158
flowers in my garden like I said I loved

100
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,840
growing them in my little veg room

101
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,598
having you know vegg and stuff and

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,598
flower and stuff at the same time

103
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,798
seedlings uh to me that's just a happy

104
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:48,359
place Heaven you know what I'm saying

105
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,400
just seeing all stages uh right then and

106
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,799
there so it's just great which other

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,959
ones have you grown you grown the Cherry

108
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,319
Cola OG and the Cherry Cola gelato I

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,560
think yeah and then the uh purple punch

110
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,598
yeah that's a winner and then the

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,280
the gorilla Z's OG Kush cross and then

112

the frost of biscotti yeah from Fast

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,640
buds fastbuds made all the receivers on

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,438
on that line like the Cherry Co the I

115
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,318
feel like there's one more that grew but

116
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,959
I can't remember yeah all of them

117
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,039
successful like I said I couldn't

118
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,000
believe when the dude you know told me

119
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,439
their photo periods I had those olif

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
flowers in the cup and they were doing

121
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,600
that and I mean they didn't get huge but

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
I mean they were still like that and

123
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,199
that main Cola was still there and I had

124
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
still good four branches coming out um I

125
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,199
don't ever really weigh my stuff right

126
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,839
off you know Harvest so I don't I

127
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,639
couldn't tell you uh but it was one of

128
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,719
the most successful harvests I've had

129
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,160
from Autoflower like I said I uh

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,199
definitely shocked it a little bit from

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,759
transplanting it I know I did but it

132
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,439
still was successful so yeah I used to

133
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:56,160
transplant with one liters into three

134
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:58,360
liters from the chore uh their Coco and

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,520
I always had success with that yeah so

136
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,879
you know and so you can do it if you do

137
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,240
it right transplanting but like if you

138
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,879
go and you have them any longer than 7

139
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,720
days usually in in a cube that's when

140
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,879
they get root bound and then you have

141
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,520
problems yeah but there's also

142
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,199
autoflowers can be finicky if you don't

143
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,079
know what you're doing or if you have

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,400
cold nighttime temps you know the beauty

145
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,719
beautiful thing with autoflowers they

146
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:25,279
can finish in as early as like 60 to 65

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,880
days yeah from germination yeah and so

148
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,359
I've had one of yours now that I can

149
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,639
remember uh it was 50 seven days wow 50

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,759
I can't remember I think it was the the

151
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,000
purple punch I could I could have pushed

152
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,919
it longer if I wanted to yeah that was a

153
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,279
personal preference but it was still

154
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,959
dense buds I've gave it to people they

155
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,239
didn't ask what's up with that you know

156
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,680
what I'm saying yeah oh man it's you you

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,038
got that good push still when you put it

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
in the grinder you know what I'm saying

159
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,159
right so uh yeah I mean that's that was

160
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,199
it 57 days I remember now yeah so less

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,360
than two months from seed you can have

162
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,720
finished flower PS yes yes sir good good

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,680
still got to dry it and cure it yeah

165
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,240
yeah yeah yeah that's yeah that's from

166
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,160
you know seed to the old chooo you know

167
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,400
what I'm saying yeah when so how many

168
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,280
years have you been growing now a little

169
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,719
over probably about four or so so uh I

170
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,598
started growing just because I don't

171
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,360
drink I don't do anything else I used to

172
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:27,000
drink and do a lot of hard drugs uh so I

173
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,840
I kind of broke away from that and uh so

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,319
I still had to get flour from other

175
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,239
people I tried to mainly get it from my

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,879
brother uh but there's a couple other

177
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
buddies and I went to go get it from

178
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,000
them and they had you know

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,479
extracurricular activities we'll call

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,839
them on the table here and there uh and

181
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,719
I just saw it and I kind of just didn't

182
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,198
feel right you know what I'm saying this

183
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
wasn't what I was trying to do this

184
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,199
wasn't bettering my life like I was

185
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,679
wanting or it was but it wasn't what I

186
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,680
was still looking for I guess you know

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,240
what I'm saying I was trying to break

188
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,639
away from that scene all together uh and

189
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,400
so um I just yeah I got a knot in my

190
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,840
stomach and I just think why not just

191
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,878
start growing my own you know what I'm

192
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,239
saying yeah uh so that's how it started

193
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,160
I I got a a little Cheapo light you know

194
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,439
off Amazon uh got a little corner in my

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,560
closet and just started uh so yeah

196
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,038
that's I mean if you want to grow your

197
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,000
own weed anybody can believe me it it is

198
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:23,680
a lot simpler than you think it's it's a

199
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
lot of learning that goes along with it

200
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,639
but you know what I'm saying it it off

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,918
the bat you'll you'll like you'll find

202
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,918
out if if it's for you or not and it's

203
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,758
as simple or as complex as you want to

204
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,318
make it that's the beauty of growing

205
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,680
right you can keep it simple and have

206
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,520
success yes you can take it to an

207
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,680
advanced level that most people couldn't

208
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,399
handle and you can have failure or you

209
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,120
can do it slowly and be super successful

210
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,598
I think that there's there's different

211
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,680
levels for everybody in scale as you get

212
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:53,839
better you can go up in scale yeah but

213
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,199
like it's great starting out with the

214
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,399
one line I mean that's I got a lot of

215
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,720
respect for you and what you've done and

216

thoughts and stick to their gun you know

261
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,160
what I'm saying like that's that's a

262
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,599
beautiful thing you know what I'm saying

263
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,879
well and I think that there's something

264
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,440
to be said for staying in your lane and

265
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,078
just getting better and better and

266
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,839
better at that one thing that you do

267
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,199
whatever that is correct your trademark

268
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,720
saying is smoke weed baby yeah and

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Ronnie Coleman who's a famous

270
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,120
bodybuilder from Texas also yeah yeah he

271
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,399
says lift weights baby I don't know if

272
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,000
you heard that from him but yeah he's

273
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,360
from the Arlington area and so before or

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,919
lightweight baby is his his saying so he

275
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,000
says lightweight baby and

276
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,360
so when you said it for the first time

277
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,839
it reminded me of Ronnie Coleman and

278
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,480
he's so passionate about lifting weights

279
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,040
he's he was you know Mr Olympia yeah I

280
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
don't know 10 times or eight times or

281
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,439
something like that and amazing

282
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,839
bodybuilder just a really nice guy but

283
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,760
like it's it's that kind of stuff that

284
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,560
that kind of drives people for with the

285
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,039
passion and I love it I love it when

286
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,239
people are super passionate about the

287
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,559
plant because I also so love everything

288
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,560
about the plan and there's so many

289
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,719
benefits to it and the more people we

290
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,119
have on board that understand that the

291
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,600
better and I feel like it's contagious

292
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,519
to a degree when you love something so

293
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,278
much people become curious about why you

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,000
love it they're like what what is up

295
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,360
with this guy they either think you're

296
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,360
crazy or they're curious about why you

297
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,440
think that way or a little both and I

298
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,039
mean it's the plant too it's uh for me

299
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,920
it's the whole aspect of it you know

300
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,559
what I'm saying not even just the

301
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,679
smoking of it you know what I'm saying

302
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,838
the whole getting to know this plant

303
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,479
learning it uh just you know what I'm

304
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,959
saying that that that's helped me

305
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,360
mentally so much yeah uh going in my

306
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:13,119
garden be able to sit there uh like I

307
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:19,519
said I open like when I do mine uh I'm

308
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:22,560
not a huge huge uh on controlling uh the

309
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,879
environment too much I control my uh

310
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,359
temperature mainly I have an AC in there

311
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,120
but when my stuff opens I open the doors

312
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,560
I open the tent if lights are on I'm in

313
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,120
there I'm talking to them I play music

314
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,479
for them um you know saying I open up I

315
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,399
ask them how you know y'all are doing

316
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,399
great I encourage them you know what I'm

317
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,519
saying uh so yeah that whole thing for

318
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,720
me and maybe if I you know didn't do all

319
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,839
that maybe it would turn out a little

320
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,560
bit better but that's for me right now

321
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,320
that helps me so much mentally or maybe

322
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,239
it wouldn't or maybe it wouldn't you

323

than 10 miles no no I'm going to be just

361
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,040
walking down that mountain right there

362
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,919
you know what I'm saying just swimming

363
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,799

367
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,278
just you can tell is weed growing

368
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,639
environment uh it gets nice and warm dur

369
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,399
the day and cool at night but not too

370
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,198
cool that's the beauty of it is it's

371
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,240
still warm at night so like those plants

372
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:35,078
will really thrive going to stretch too

373
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,959
much I think you know the the heat

374
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,000
there's a little heat there but it's not

375
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,919
overly hot like some places just get

376
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,198
insane yeah I'm I'm from Texas so uh

377
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:48,639
like our when we do get extremely hot I

378
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,599
mean we could be at 90 by 10 a.m. or

379
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,480
something you know what I'm saying

380
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,199
really and if it keeps cranking we can

381
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:58,199
go 105 or something so um yeah those you

382
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,000

383
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,078
you know it's not too bad I mean we got

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,799
90s I don't know we couldn't check the

385
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,879

386
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,039
a couple days there but you know it hits

387

388
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,919
not too too much so it kind of not too

389
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,399
bad you know what I'm saying like it's

390
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,879

391
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,679
you know what I'm saying too so it's

392
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,039

yeah and it's like in Passionate people

418
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,439
it's like it's not even about the money

419
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,638
it's about the plant right at the end of

420
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,680
the day it's about the plant and what it

421

508
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,440
probably the Main Music I listen to now

509
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,038
after I kind of got you know off the the

510
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,279
booze and stuff I stopped listening to

511
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,079
my country music as much and stuff going

512
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,798
more towards the the rosta vibe you know

513
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,798
what I'm saying of the smoke weed and

514
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,359
less of the like I'm sad cuz I'm drunk

515
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:36,440
yeah EXA yeah I lost everything cuz I'm

516
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,399
drunk well no [ __ ] buddy

517
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,798
yeah yeah I think you know ree music

518
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,120
definitely embodies all of that you know

519
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:46,639
this the spirit way more uplifting way

520
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,399
more uplifting love it's all about love

521
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
and

522
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,880
happiness you know I think there is some

523
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,839
you know there is they do sting about

524
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,200
struggle too and I love that oh yeah

525
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,359
yeah you know but like most of the

526
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,440
reggae it has a good beat to it you can

527
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,279
move to it and it's just good vibrations

528
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,880
good energy I just saying like you know

529
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,678
majority of Ray artists where they you

530
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,320
know they come from you know Jamaica or

531
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,798
whatnot they ain't got the great

532
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,240
conditions and just goes to show you man

533
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,079
that you jamming good music smoking some

534
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,839
good ganja you probably have a good

535
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,119
attitude you know what I'm saying as you

536
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,639
can see it affects people and Al all

537
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,079
over the world you know what I'm saying

538
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,159
that just goes to show you man uh what

539
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,879
what it'll do for you I think it changes

540
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,280
your mind on what you think is good and

541
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,440
bad and what you actually what you might

542
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,798
actually need in life you know what I'm

543
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,960
saying yeah and I think happiness is a

544
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,798
choice too yeah to a degree I mean we

545
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,000
can choose to be upset we can choose to

546
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,440
be happy we can we can choose in this in

547
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the moment Y how we want to how we want

548
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,840
to be and how we want to live our lives

549
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,679
and correct sometimes it's harder than

550
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,199
other times but like at the same time I

551
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,519
feel like it is a choice to a degree I

552
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,679
mean there's obviously there's moments

553
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,158
where it's going to be tough and you

554
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,440
were're GNA have these emotions but all

555
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,679
that stuff is a choice and reggae music

556
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,000
definitely will put you in the right

557
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,120
mindset oh yeah for sure for sure it

558
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,400
just that's I I I I hear it and I feel

559
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,239
it you know what I'm saying you hear it

560
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,640
you feel it and then you just start

561
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,480
grooving and moving and just man puts a

562
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,000

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,159
to show you if it's not the real one you

644
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,000
can be honest I won't have hurt feelings

645
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,520
but just tell me the truth yeah yeah

646
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,319
yeah and I got some Sour Diesel to show

647
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,798
you and sure enough it was the real Sour

648
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,720
Diesel that I haven't seen for a long

649
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,000
long long time I've seen so much Sour

650
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,360
Diesel over the last year

651
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,960
but none of them were this grown grown

652
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:36,319
to this particular standard maybe maybe

653
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,679
it's the same cut we're going to test it

654
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,678
genetically to compare yeah but it was

655
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,120
as sour as it gets like the real nose of

656
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,880
Sour Diesel that was like not just burnt

657
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,079
Tire it did have a little bit of that in

658
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,159
there yeah but it had the Citrus back it

659
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,798

672

special that's a super special one and

673
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:23,200
Dave also had the Nigerian Haze that was

674
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,759
another one that looked terrible but

675
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,159
then you smoke it and it's one of those

676
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:29,119
ones that it creeps up on you gently

677
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,559
lifts you up and then you're like you're

678
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:34,278
cool yeah yeah it almost look like um

679
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,119
like little weeds or something almost

680
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:38,480
like you pick up off the ground yeah

681
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,119
yeah like little little yeah it was pody

682
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,519
and it was like these little small like

683
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,359
just little small bracks that were like

684
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,759
three inches apart from each other was

685
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,798
like on Twigs it was crazy it was crazy

686
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,720
it was one of the craziest looking weeds

687
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,599
I've ever seen land R for sure for sure

688
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,000
yeah good stuff so what was your

689
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,359
highlight of the whole weekend I mean

690
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,558
probably my most highlight was seeing

691
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,240
Marlon Asher perform live I haven't ever

692
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,960
done that seeing him put on his show was

693
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,240
awesome he puts on a great show to me he

694
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,159
was to me he was the best singer there

695
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,399
like or that's just my personal

696
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,679
preference I love his music uh I mean

697
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:18,199
all the artists they were great all the

698
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,120
artists they were they were great but uh

699
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,200
yeah to me that was like his performance

700
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,719
was special so so I've seen Marlin

701
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,240
performed many many many many times and

702
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,600
that sound was some of the best I've

703
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,359
ever heard it made his voice sound even

704
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,599
even better than his he was just on on

705
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,038
you know sometimes when people were just

706
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,599
on but also the sound system the way his

707
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,759
voice carried over the crowd and where

708
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,599
you could stand because we were in the

709
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,960
back and then we went to the front yeah

710
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,199
and we were at the side and then we went

711
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,399
to the other side and then we were in

712
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,679
the back again it sounded good

713
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:53,759
everywhere but like his voice was just

714
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,720
perfect yeah you know and and his band

715
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,359
he has this this band they're newer uh

716
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,120
they've been working together recently

717
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,079
and they just sounded amazing the backup

718
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,398
singer sounded great and you could hear

719
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,398
everything it wasn't getting meshed

720
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:09,879
together everything was very distinct

721
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,158
and just the the the time like almost

722
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,360
like a boom box sound instead of like

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,440
when you know saying live sound gets too

724
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:19,359
like I said too loud or whatever it just

725
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,038
mushes together uh this was real you

726
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,038
know fine like you like you could tell

727
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,119
like somebody took time and the the

728
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,519
sound people really did their job

729
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,079
everything just sounded good uh so yeah

uh got to work you know what I'm saying

769
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,240
yeah so let's dive into genetics all the

770
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,000
stuff you've been growing over the last

771
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,640
four years so I've been growing a long

772
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,679
time I've been in the industry a long

773
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,720
time so I've seen all the different

774
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,200
stuff but over the last four

775
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,360
years what have been the

776
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,240
highlights um

777
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:10,959
highlights uh one of my like I said I

778
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,278
first started off I got the like I said

779
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,399
I just got a small little light of

780
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,839
course I went the uh I love growing

781
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:22,278
marijuana route uh you get the 10 by 10

782
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:24,839
which you know it's it's the ilgm.com

783
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:27,359
yeah yeah uh which I mean like I said

784
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,480
one of my favorite plants came from them

785
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,599
uh you if they hit or miss a little bit

786
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,200
nothing against them but I mean to me I

787
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,439
went that route cuz like when you first

788
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,759
hear oh you're going to have to kill

789
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,679
plants you're gonna have to you know

790
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,759
this will happen so it's like oh buy 10

791
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,080
get 10 uh so yeah I got I first started

792
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,798
off with them I did grow a photo period

793
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:51,199
from them uh zittles and um it came out

794

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,360
saying love the fade love the color uh

804
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,639
so that would have been my first little

805
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,918
highlight that I love that uh but like I

806
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,840
said their genetics aren't really

807
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,880
consistent or whatever um so yeah I

808
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:27,038
started draw doing some other ones um I

809
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:29,840
had a um a Northern Lights from Grower's

810
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,919
choice I think is my next good

811
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:36,798
successful one that uh uh it actually

812
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,240
didn't look the best but for for me I

813
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:41,519
got [ __ ] weight off of it and it

814
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,000
smoked great yeah I don't know if it's a

815
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,359
true Northern Lights but uh it it the

816
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,398
effects were really good uh and then

817
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,639
yeah my nexts were were yours like that

818
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,678
Frosty biscotti that first tried like I

819
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,120
said uh I knew I was on to something

820
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:57,480
special when I got successfully to do

821
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,918
after I transplanted an Autoflower I got

822
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,240
him somebody thought I thought they were

823
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,278
photo periods uh transplanting them so

824
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,319
that was a highlight too was that first

825
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:09,440
success of uh of uh uh Autoflower

826
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:11,200
getting transplanted and then yeah so

827
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,840
everything I've grown from you like I

828
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,960
said then this last uh one that has been

829
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,398
really I've been getting a great a great

830
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,278
praise for another the gorilla Z's OG

831
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:25,639
Kush cross uh man that the fade on that

832
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:28,038
one has just been amazing and the smoke

833
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,679
on it too so I mean that flavor a lot of

834
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:32,079
flavor a lot you know a good effect and

835
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,679
it looks good you know what I'm saying

836
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:38,240
that that the trifecta of what you want

837
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,159
in the in weed there uh and so yeah I

838
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,120
I'd probably have to say all in all that

839
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,600
yeah that gorilla z zoji Kush cross that

840
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,398
last one I probably like that last one I

841
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:49,038
still have it pinned on my Instagram uh

842
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,359
I have a picture of It kind of like

843
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,158
almost dried up a little bit after

844
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,199
harvest like got one lane down or

845
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,000
whatever I have a back a black

846
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,240
background trying to be a little more

847
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,919
professional on my uh my photos there

848
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,519
right uh but yeah that one like I said

849
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,679
was just is probably the most

850
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,679
highlighted one uh like I said do your

851
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,759
purple punch OG Kush cross I love that

852
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,679
one it doesn't to me the one I did

853
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:16,599
didn't it didn't pack as high as a punch

854
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,399
but the the flavor on it

855
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,319
man I've never tasted anything I can

856
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:25,638
only describe it like as a pickle

857
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:28,439
deal flavor there's nothing else like it

858
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:31,398
I've never and I mean

859
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,200
it's like you sweet though yeah it has

860
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:36,879
like yeah but it's not like a a sweet

861
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,720
pickle to me like it's uh like a regular

862
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,559
pickle or kosher or whatever you want to

863
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,639
call has still has that like a a a kick

864
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:44,440
to it you know what I'm saying little

865
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,278
bite yeah a little bite man when you hit

866
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,200
it it's like you hit it in that back of

867
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:51,159
the throat and it's like man I every

868
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,919
time I Exel on that one um I think

869
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:57,639
pickle man it is just great so uh all

870
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:00,399
the trifecta would be the gorilla Z's

871
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:02,199
and and then uh like I said all just

872
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,759
that flavor-wise would be that purple

873
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,840
punch man like I said I would just break

874
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:08,798
off little pieces and put in my bong

875
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,240
just if I went to the I smoke in my

876
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,918
restroom for the for the most part if I

877
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,079
had to use the restroom wash my hands or

878
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,440
anything I'd grab a little piece and

879
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:21,158
just get that flavor nice it tasted so

880
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,519
good so in the last four years what's

881
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,120
the best weed you ever seen Grown by

882
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,599
other people I was about to say that

883
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,319
that guava Cherry probably not the best

884
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,240
I seen but that was that was special

885
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,960

remember what it was called off hand but

888
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,960

889
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,519
had like a like little buds together uh

890
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,919

there you go there you go there you go

918
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,799
yeah so tell us a little bit about your

919
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,199
grow setup how you how you're doing

920
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:50,398
stuff you because you do you used soil

921
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,759
and you also do like a hydro setup right

922
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:57,079
yes yes uh I'm having more success with

923
00:33:52,759 --> 00:34:02,919
my hydro I I run five gallon buckets and

924
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:04,918
I I was going to do like the the r RW or

925
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,200
rdwc the

926
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,159
recirculating uh but I find it better

927
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,119
and easier just to do whatever call

928
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,039
Bubble buckets or whatever where I just

929
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,879
I drill hole on my side

930
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:20,279
I put the air hose in there drop an

931
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:22,118
AirStone uh and I just change it weekly

932
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,280
you know what I'm saying um right now

933
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,159
I'm using rise nutrients I'm have I

934
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,560
think I'm going to try a cut an edge I'm

935
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,159
going to try their run theirs next next

936
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:34,519
um so yeah I do that and I have great

937
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,760
success with it uh but you know of

938
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,440
course soil always tastes a little bit

939
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,960
better and stuff so I love my soil but I

940
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,760
also you know I think there's a place

941
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,800
for everything yeah for sure I mean I

942
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:49,000
saying like

943
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:53,919
the once you or for me once I saw the

944
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,519
the how quickly the rapid rate of uh of

945
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,480
uh these plants growing in the hydro

946
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:00,559
just blew my mind you know saying I

947
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,159
heard about it because I I first started

948
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,000
off with Coco and then I really for some

949
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,399
reason I couldn't get that going like it

950
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,719
just wasn't going so I switched to soil

951
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,119
and actually had a pretty good success

952
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:15,199
and then I kind of got funky on that for

953
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,838
some reason I don't know uh I think I

954
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,159
was trying to learn too much at once you

955
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:21,119
know what I'm saying I was just honest

956
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,078
canv canvas canvas canvas people should

957
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,358
start out with soil cuz there's a buffer

958
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,039
and I I like soil you know there there's

959
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,759
I like a lot of things about soil but I

960
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,199
do like the buffer that you have with

961
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,920
soil yeah whereas Hydro you screw things

962
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,039
up you can kill your plants I mean it's

963
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,838
it's like that it's yeah it can be just

964
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,039
like that yeah you know if you and then

965
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,119
Coco uh if you're talking about Coco

966
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:43,880
that's completely inert you know it's

967
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,440
like uh that doesn't have anything in it

968
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,880
you got to feed it properly right from

969
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,159
the get-go and you know you can overfeed

970
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,720
it or underfeed it there's all these

971
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,559
questions where a soil it's like there's

972
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,519
this little bit of a buffer yeah yeah

973
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,719
and you use good soil and it's a great

974
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,199
place to start it's it's you know

975
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,799
everyone has their opinion on how to

976
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:03,679
start but I feel like soil is just an

977
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,400
easy way you know Rockwall I think takes

978
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,598
it's it's like the Ferrari right like in

979
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,000
some ways like as far as not everybody

980
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,318
knows how to drive a Ferrari and it

981
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,440
takes a long time to learn how to drive

982
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:13,440
a Ferrari but once you learn how to

983
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,440
drive a Ferrari it goes really fast I

984
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,639
think that is Rockwell I think that

985
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,679
Rockwell has its place for certain

986
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,480
things

987
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:23,358
like especially mothers and clones yeah

988
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,039
okay especially mothers and clones and

989
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:29,400
then dwc I've seen great flower come out

990
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:32,159
of dwc my friend Alfred Master Yoda he

991
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,240
is the king of dwc he's won many many

992
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,239
cups with

993
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,118
his culture yeah yeah he's he he's solid

994
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,959
he's got the master yoa cush he's yeah

995
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,240
yeah he's a he's just an amazing person

996
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,358
he's a really good grower but I mean

997
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,279
there's so many different ways you can

998
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,519
grow so many different substrates you

999
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,560
can use yeah yeah so I try to keep the

1000
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:51,920
hydro buckets and soil in my garden all

1001
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,358
the time uh like I said I I won't ever I

1002
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,880
won't ever kick either one of those out

1003
00:36:53,358 --> 00:37:01,519
I don't think uh like I said so I have

1004
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:04,440
my closet um which uh I I veg there for

1005
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,559
the most part I I've been doing 16 hours

1006
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,358
when I get back I'm going bump it up to

1007
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,838
20 hours for autoflow you got to go 20

1008
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,199
that's one one thing people don't

1009
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:14,159
understand and I feel like the you get

1010
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:16,759
the most yield and benefit even though

1011
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,598
it costs a little bit more yeah for your

1012
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,240
you know for your veg well same thing

1013
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,240
like veg I veg at 20 hours too but that

1014
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,598
that's you're you can do 18 you can do

1015
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:26,959
whatever but like I veg a little bit

1016
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,480
longer stuff like blue dream than I used

1017
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,880
to have back in the day if you did less

1018
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,280
than 20 there's a chance that it would

1019
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,280
kick into flour a little bit and so the

1020
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,880
Clones wouldn't be as healthy but uh I

1021
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,720
would say that for autof flowers you get

1022
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,160
the best bang for the buck at 20 for

1023
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,399
yield and everything else some people

1024
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,879
like why I have to pay more for

1025
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,599
electricity it it pays for itself you'll

1026
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,400
get a better yield you'll get better

1027
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,240
structure it looks amazing well you got

1028
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,400
me excited because dude like I said I

1029
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,959
the like I said I don't even people ask

1030
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,680
me why I run I don't run even 18 I run

1031
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,720
16 hours and the results I'm getting off

1032
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,838
your you can still get good results

1033
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:05,799
don't get me wrong you can still get

1034
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,318
good results but at 20 I think it's even

1035
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,920
better well I saying you're getting me

1036
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:11,079
super excited about seeing these results

1037
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,920
off the the 20 hour and who knows maybe

1038
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:15,440
you'll find the 18 is better for you you

1039
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,519
know what I mean or or

1040
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,280
16 do at and they don't like autoflowers

1041
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:21,800
and they do them at 12 well that's why

1042
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,440
you got to use more light that's the

1043
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,760
beauty of the autl is you can keep the

1044
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,599
light on and it's not going to go back

1045
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,599
into veg not going to stress out the pl

1046
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,400
it's going to thrive I think people grow

1047
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,519
their Auto flowers like I do like in the

1048
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,240
same tent same environment but they're

1049
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,318
they're flipping that whole thing so one

1050
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,838
one half of the time they're growing it

1051
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:42,639
it's getting 18 to 20 hours and then all

1052
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:44,239
of a sudden it's getting 12 12 when you

1053
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,159
know that's not what it's designed for

1054
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,199
it's designed to get the exact same

1055
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,559
amount of light you're giving it it

1056
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,199
doesn't need to be flipped I mean you

1057
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,199
can grow in Alaska where it doesn't get

1058
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,719
dark for that period of the year and it

1059
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:57,000
won't affect their flower cycle it loves

1060
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:59,159
it yeah yeah yeah for sure so yeah aut

1061
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,400
of flowers pretty trippy you know oh man

1062
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:04,559
I love them like I said uh people people

1063
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,838
bash on them all the time there's plenty

1064
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,159
of people to bash on him but it's like

1065
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,358
such a personal preference thing and

1066
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:09,679
that's what people don't understand is

1067
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:11,639
maybe they're not not the right choice

1068
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,879
for you but for a lot of people out

1069
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,920
there they like autoflowers aof flow

1070
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,000
there's some companies that make

1071
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,599
millions of dollars a month on selling

1072
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,480
autoflow seeds and there's a reason for

1073
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,680
it yeah yeah uh yeah because they're

1074
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,039
good to to for certain environments for

1075
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,118
certain people for certain conditions

1076
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,279
they are fantastic if you want to just

1077
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,519
have a plant that you grow on your

1078
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,200
window sill and you live in Barcelona

1079
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,000
correct autoflow is easy yeah yeah like

1080
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,519
I said you don't really need a light

1081
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,199
schedule right so uh I mean yeah they're

1082
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,599
just like I said they're just amazing to

1083
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:46,039
me because like I said it you can all in

1084
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:50,680
my one area like I said my I converted a

1085
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:52,599
walk-in closet to uh to my veg area

1086
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,159
thank you from to my wife for letting me

1087
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,359
do that it was actually a functional

1088
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,759
closet we had clothes hanging in there

1089
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:01,039
that's where I first took over over the

1090
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,280
corner uh I took over a little bit more

1091
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,880
uh I was talking about I need more tents

1092
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,760
and maybe uh building something and then

1093
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,160
she finally gave me permission to just

1094
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,720
take it over so yeah I I took over uh

1095
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:16,000
that so um I love having that like I

1096

set up right there I get to see the

1100
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,000
whole basically the life cycle of the

1101
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,559
flower you know of the plant and so then

1102

I transplanted I got a 4x4 where is my

1103

right out outside of it to uh can

1113
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:58,159

1114
00:40:55,159 --> 00:41:00,159
everything turns on I open my stuff up

1115

and like I said I just start talking my

1116
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,118

1120
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,519
bar light on the side I don't even know

1121
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,079
what I got from my brother I don't even

1122
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,119
know what company it's from but it's

1123
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,000
actually pretty are you measuring ppfd

1124
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,200
you measure your par no I don't I need

1125
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,960
to get par meter I don't like see right

1126
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:31,519
now with my my uh

1127
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,720
my uh Spider Farmers like they're the

1128
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,920
old ballast yeah so I have to take them

1129
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:39,559
off and readjust them like so I don't

1130
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,800
even know if I'm at 50 or 40 really you

1131
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:43,318
know what I'm saying I need to get a

1132
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,160
meter to adjust those uh so right now

1133
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:47,440
like I said I'm not even uh trying to

1134
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,759
measure all that stuff because it's hard

1135
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,318
for me to uh change the lighting system

1136
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,760
on it but I don't try to I'll probably

1137
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,599
just drive myself crazy honestly you

1138
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,640
know what I'm saying uh so I actually I

1139
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,559
keep those two uh spider Farmers cranked

1140
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,279
up to 100% And I just adjust their

1141
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,000
height if I think to and I really

1142
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,800
haven't ran ran into any problems doing

1143
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,199
that so far uh a couple plants that

1144
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,640
maybe stretched a little bit more than I

1145
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,639
wanted uh but until I really can get

1146
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,239
more money to get more system I need to

1147
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:20,440
get a light that has canopy next too

1148
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,838
yeah yeah faving faving we we might even

1149
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,400
have some for you all right hell yeah so

1150
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:25,599
yeah I need to get that going and then

1151
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,760
yeah like I said I have a bar light on

1152
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:32,240
the side and then in my in my tent I

1153
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,480
have a a fluence light and that's just

1154
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,358
man I don't even know I got that also

1155
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,760
from my brother but that thing hits

1156
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:41,838
every corner that 4x4 so yeah it's it's

1157
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,520
packed in there and that one has the

1158
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,838
little you know the adjusting like you

1159
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,838
can go from one two three four five you

1160
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,599
know what saying all the way to 100%

1161
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,799
yeah that that light's badass uh so yeah

1162
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:57,440
I I when I go in there I probably start

1163
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,800
off about 50% or so on that one and then

1164
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,280
I probably crank it up to about 85% or

1165
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,519
something I don't think I've had to do

1166
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,680
anything 100% in there yet what do you

1167
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:09,358
try to keep your temperature and

1168
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:11,279
humidity at uh in my veg room uh I try

1169
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:17,000
to keep the temperature it stays about

1170
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,319
like 74 to 76 or so um I freak out if it

1171
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,079
gets close to 80% you know what I'm

1172
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,800
saying I know I know in my head

1173
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,240
everything will be fine for the

1174
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,519
temperature or humidity uh temperature

1175
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:27,439
temperature you like keeping a little

1176
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,920
lower temp in your yeah yeah yeah like I

1177
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,639
said I only have the one so where I'm at

1178
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,400
humidity you don't worry about too much

1179
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,440
I really don't I do I have a

1180
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,119
dehumidifier I have a humidifier I don't

1181
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,240
run them I was actually tripping over

1182
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,079
them more than anything when they were

1183
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:46,519
out there in my closet it stays uh CU I

1184
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:50,680
have so many plants I have the buckets

1185
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:55,039
in there it stays about 60% 55 to 60%

1186
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:57,598
humidity uh the flower tint um nice will

1187
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,199
stay roughly about the same times it

1188
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,119
will drop when I have cut the AC off but

1189
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:05,919
when I that AC itself creates humidity

1190
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,280
yeah so um I don't really have to worry

1191
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,079
about it really spiking it doesn't

1192
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,000
create you know what I'm saying it's not

1193
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,599
a humidifier so it doesn't just bust out

1194
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,679
like um you know spits you know spits of

1195
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,079
water right so um like I said just

1196
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:22,639
naturally I'm sitting about 6 50 to 60%

1197
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,680
humidity on both of them uh if a storm

1198
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,639
comes in or something one time we did

1199
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:30,399
get a whole bunch of rain I had a whole

1200
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:34,400
bunch of stuff flowering and drying at

1201
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,400
the same time uh it did it dry it did

1202
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,880
dry it did it dry actually I think it

1203
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,599
helped me man it rained for like a week

1204
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,760
but luckily it hit like when I first

1205
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,240
started doing it so when you first dry

1206
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,720
anyways it's you're hitting about 60%

1207
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:49,838
humidity or so right next to the plant

1208
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,318
that that I've seen you know what I'm

1209
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,078
saying because I normally dry in a

1210
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:55,880
cardboard box uh I don't have a drive

1211
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,318
room or anything like that nothing

1212
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,599
professional uh I do it as I go I either

1213
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:04,800
I make like a makeshift wall out in my

1214
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,000
upstairs living room uh so I need to

1215
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,318
work on that but yeah I'll I can do that

1216
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,400
put it in the room and the the room

1217
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,800
temperature of my bedroom stays probably

1218
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,720
about like 60 60 degrees uh so yeah when

1219
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,920
the lights are in the flower ttin it it

1220
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,399
probably gets up to about like 73 and

1221
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,760
then my nighttime temps uh probably hit

1222
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,440
about like uh 68 69 or something wow

1223
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,079
there's not too much fluctuation

1224
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,079
with uh the the uh the barrier like I

1225
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,359
said I have that AC right outside that

1226
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:39,599
flower tint and I thought it would maybe

1227
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,000
get colder in there than it does that it

1228
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,640
would actually get to like the 60° and

1229
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,400
just having that tin in there and those

1230
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,199
those plants make heat you know what I'm

1231
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,880
saying they're a living right they're a

1232
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:52,879
living thing so they're creating heat

1233
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,640
themselves so um well the light

1234
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,240
definitely creates some heat yeah yeah

1235
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,799
yeah for sure I'm saying with lights off

1236
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:59,239
you know I'm saying yeah yeah yeah

1237
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,440
saying I thought maybe it'd get colder

1238
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:03,598
like around 60 but and it's insulated

1239
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,079
those tents are yeah saying the tents

1240
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,280
are thicker than you think and stuff so

1241
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,119
um yeah like I said mainly I control my

1242
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:15,480
temperature because like I said uh my

1243
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,280
bedroom is above a uh garage so whatever

1244
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,880
they did to try to insulate or didn't

1245
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,599
insulate between the garage and our room

1246
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,440
so if it's hot uh in that garage it just

1247
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,039
goes through the uh the room so before I

1248
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,880
even started growing our bedroom would

1249
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:38,039
be in like summertime like

1250
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:40,160
75 maybe 80° and that's when the the AC

1251
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:41,400
trying to cool it down to 72 degrees

1252
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:43,679
like it would just like come through

1253
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,519
there so yeah I gotta keep that AC on

1254
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,239
all the time if not it'll just it really

1255
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,519
does Spike yeah I feel you that's the

1256
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:51,558
last thing you want is hot yeah well uh

1257
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,000
anybody that's been following me for

1258
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,400
like I went to

1259
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,800
Disneyland Disney World like two years

1260
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,079
ago and my right before I left my AC

1261
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,640
broke so I have a video of help me help

1262
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,519
me help me tell me what to do people I

1263
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,440
need help like I said I was only growing

1264
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:12,599
for like two two years at the time I'm

1265
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,400
showing temperatures of 92 in my tent uh

1266
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,519
luckily I made it through uh everything

1267
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,559
got harvested 92 is better than 102 yeah

1268
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:23,719
yeah for sure for sure for sure so 92

1269
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,519
you can you can survive yeah they did

1270
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,679
they survived that you know uh well two

1271
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,519
it was

1272
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:33,118
what really freaked me out this is two

1273
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:35,318
or three days before we had to go so I'm

1274
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,200
trying to tell somebody how to take care

1275
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,358
of my plants yeah and then they're

1276
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,799
dealing with the heat issue and so I'm

1277
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:45,440
like freaking out about that and it's

1278
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,119
just like man just the the the extra

1279
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,559
stress of like I don't know if you had

1280
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,640
anybody try to take care of your plants

1281
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,480
but you're like all right you do this

1282
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,239
you do this and they say something wrong

1283
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,440
you're like no no no no no no don't do

1284
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,519
it that way no know you got to do it

1285
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,760
this way

1286
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,759
and so uh so yeah I was just freaking

1287
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,599
out that something would have you know

1288
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,920
they had messed something up a hair or

1289
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,200
something and then just the the

1290
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,599
temperature itself would have just

1291
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:13,719
killed them but they they made it

1292
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:15,519
through the first time I left to go I

1293
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:18,318
was going snowboarding you know this is

1294
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,800
when I was 17 and I had an apartment I

1295
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:23,039
was going snowboarding and I had my

1296
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,359
buddy watched the plants that were in I

1297
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,279
had three guys there was three of us

1298
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:27,400
living in a one bit apartment I had the

1299
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,760
main room

1300
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,519
bedom the closet was mine I had plants

1301
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,200
in there and I had my buddy and I'm like

1302
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:37,838
one tablesp of fish ulion with a gallon

1303
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:40,078
of water all he heard was gallon and

1304
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:43,000
fish emotion and so he's like well I

1305
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,720
just put a gallon of fish emotion and so

1306
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,199
oh write stuff down it's important to

1307
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:49,838
write stuff down the weed tasted like

1308
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,439
salmon I never smoked it we somebody

1309
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:52,798
ended up buying it not for a lot of

1310
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,358
money but they bought it and they smoked

1311
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:57,000
it and they were like it's fine and

1312
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:58,920
nothing I would smoke yeah yeah but was

1313
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,400
like some salmon weed yeah not not

1314
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,200
Salmon Creek big bud but salmon Bud dang

1315
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,200
dude so fish you can't flush it up yeah

1316
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,399
there's no flushing that much Salon it

1317
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,679
was towards the

1318
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,400
end so we went and harvested but yeah

1319
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:14,078
you got to be real specific and write

1320
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,039
stuff down when you have people taking

1321
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,440
care of your grow this was when I had a

1322
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:21,358
closet grow this was you know I'm 47 so

1323
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,920
this was 30 years ago that's 30 yeah if

1324
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:26,239
you were 17 that's 30 years ago yeah I

1325
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,159
mean I I keep notebooks for everything I

1326
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,318
do I write write down in my notebook uh

1327
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:33,519
I I would recommend everybody get a

1328
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:35,239
notebook if you're growing especially

1329
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,559
like I have so many systems different

1330
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:40,479
things going on right I'm trying this

1331
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,240
trying that so I got my buckets uh you

1332
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,440
got to keep on top of that KN when you

1333
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,039
know when you change them if I don't let

1334
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,440
them go longer than a week uh when you

1335
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,639
know when they start stretching you got

1336
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:54,599
to change them every other day every 3

1337
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:56,798
days depends on the strain or whatever

1338
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,079
uh but yeah uh I don't let them go long

1339
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:00,798
than a week in my bucket so yeah I write

1340
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:04,480
everything down so I know when I changed

1341
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:07,960
it uh when I you know if I have soil

1342
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,960
going maybe uh you know strains drink

1343
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,000
differently so you know you might not

1344
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,838
have to water this one every time that

1345
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,039
you water the other two or something

1346
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:19,159
like that so yeah yeah is to me is very

1347
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:22,558
important to have a notebook write stuff

1348
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:24,480
down and that way if your bud has to

1349
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,119
take care of it like I do I write the

1350
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,119
day I write this I write I put 9 in make

1351
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,760
sure they write it down too yeah for

1352
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,160
sure that's the best I mean everything

1353
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,559
should be kind of logged in what you're

1354
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,358
doing yeah um you know we have automated

1355
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,680
equipment but it's still we record

1356
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:39,838
everything yeah you're just not hand

1357
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,239
doing it's just no and we still do check

1358
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:42,880
stuff by hand you know it's like

1359
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:45,039
especially calibration we make sure you

1360
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,318
got yeah machines can need calibration

1361
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:50,079
if you're doing pH or EC um you you

1362
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:51,279
should calibrate those regularly we

1363
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,400
calibrate them before we use them every

1364
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,798
day yeah like we used to be once a week

1365
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,639
and now it's like we calibrate them

1366
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:58,199
every day and if we're comparing

1367
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,639
carrying them and one is different then

1368
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:01,199
there's a reason so we need to

1369
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,078
investigate why that's different because

1370
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,719
that can throw everything off yeah but

1371
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,760
uh you know and it's like our we measure

1372
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,480
runoff we we check for runoff too I want

1373
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,720
to know what the runoff is testing at

1374
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,599
yeah what how much is the plant eating

1375
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,798
you know what what's it what's going

1376
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,400
through what's going on is the pH

1377
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:18,280
changing in there if there is I mean

1378
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,798
those are little telltale signs that you

1379
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,280
have issues yeah yeah for sure I mean

1380
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:24,838
that's great like all these monitoring

1381
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,920
systems now that we have like you know

1382
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:27,199
what I'm saying I wish I can get one you

1383
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,039
know what I'm saying that's that will be

1384
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,039
in the future but yeah like I said you

1385
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:34,079
all the data and all the the problems

1386
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,239
you can search for and um I mean it's

1387
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,440
just it's great so we can get the best

1388
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,199
results out of this plan you know what

1389
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,119
I'm saying which which it you know

1390
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,759
that's what this plan deserves the more

1391
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,280
information you have the more you have

1392
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,640
an opportunity to make a better decision

1393
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,400
on what you're going to do moving

1394
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,798
forward and how to adjust stuff so the

1395
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,200
more data you're working with the better

1396
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:55,280
it paints a better picture of what's

1397
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,118
going on and then also having someone

1398
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,319
who's you know better than myself look

1399
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,440
at the data and go dude what are you

1400
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:03,039
doing here or or dude you could try

1401
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,440
doing this and maybe this will improve

1402
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,558
yeah just different set of eyes

1403
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,000
different thoughts you know what I'm

1404
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:09,280
saying different ideas that can come out

1405
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,480
of sharing information list if you

1406
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,839
listen to too many people's advice and

1407
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,480
try to combine it all you're going to

1408
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,119
screw everything up yeah it's better to

1409
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,318
listen to one person's advice do all

1410
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:19,400
that and if it doesn't really work

1411
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:21,279
switch to a different person and follow

1412
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,680
that to the T yeah and eventually you'll

1413
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,119
build your own system and then you can

1414
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,798
ask for little bits of advice and you

1415
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,519
can change one thing at a time and see

1416
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:31,159
well does that help does that not help

1417
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,480
yeah yeah but this is a long-term thing

1418
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:34,039
and a lot of people don't understand it

1419
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,920
they think it's just like from cycle to

1420
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:37,960
cycle well you know there's a commitment

1421
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,599
to the plant that you're making by

1422
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,159
growing and to learn how to grow really

1423
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,519
well or to learn how to do any of this

1424
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:46,639
it takes a lifetime right you're con

1425
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:48,079
Master like four years I've been doing

1426
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,639
this for a long time and I'm not a

1427
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,440
master by any means I think that I have

1428
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,558
some friends that are way better at the

1429
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,798
cultivation side I may be better at seed

1430
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,640
production I might be better at this or

1431
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,960
reversals and all these things we all

1432
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,519
have our own Niche but like it's great

1433
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,240
when you can bounce ideas but also

1434
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:07,000
having the data to where this is what I

1435
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:09,798
do you know let's look at grow sense we

1436
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,719
use grow sense from grodan and and we

1437
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:13,960
use their sensors and it's like these

1438
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:15,719
things they're egro software and that

1439
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,480
the grow sense sensors and it's like

1440
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:19,399
yeah these things are amazing agretech

1441
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,480
and we have redundancy so not only do we

1442
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,079
use one we're using multiple and we're

1443
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,719
in a beautiful time where we can use two

1444
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:26,280
different things and then we can compare

1445
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,679
the data and go okay something's wrong

1446
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,798
here guys yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean

1447
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:31,719
like you said it's cool that like you

1448
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:34,318
said like people like kind of specialize

1449
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:36,118
in you know their own little thing and

1450
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:38,639
that's way like you everybody say you

1451
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:40,798
can do ideas off them and stuff and I

1452
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,558
think it helps you know if you're not so

1453
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:44,159
good at something you can get a little

1454
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,319
advice and help and you said not

1455
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,838
everybody might not be the best at

1456
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:48,798
everything you know what I'm saying so

1457
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:51,719
right we need to help each other well

1458
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:54,280
writing writing stuff down also when

1459
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,959
when I need feedback on this like what

1460
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,240
on genetics or something like that if

1461
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,199
you have it all written down you can

1462
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,719
tell me what you did and yeah you know

1463
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:03,078
you can and that's the beauty of being

1464
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,558
able to help other people yeah so yeah

1465
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:08,039
yeah I mean that's I mean writing it

1466
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:09,640
down to like if somebody's like oh dang

1467
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:11,920
you had great results how' you do that

1468
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:15,558
I'm like oh [ __ ] I don't know off

1469
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,358
hand with this yeah so I could go back

1470
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:20,200
and look at it and tell them you know oh

1471
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:22,880
I had to I did I did it weekly for this

1472
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:25,039
long and then whatever I I had to start

1473
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,880
swapping them out and uh so like when I

1474
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:31,000
run my hydro nutrient

1475
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,880
I'll uh I'll do a good week of uh veg

1476
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,119
still or at least maybe not a week but

1477
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,640
about five days yeah I'll I'll do I'll

1478
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,960
run them straight and steal the veg

1479
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:43,480
nutrients for about five days and then I

1480
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,559
swap to a half and half of veg Bloom for

1481
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,639
a week and then I go straight to the veg

1482
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:50,000
or Bloom so yeah I mean I saying that's

1483
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:52,838
just stuff I learned too uh you know

1484
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,559
it's helps that you write stuff down so

1485
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:57,159
yeah if somebody was asking hey what do

1486
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,640
you what do you run them which people

1487
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:01,440
have asked me before uh what nutrients I

1488
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:02,920
run in my buckets and how I do it so

1489
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,798
yeah I've helped a few people out and

1490
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,920
that's I've I couldn't helped them out

1491
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:07,199
if I didn't write it down you know what

1492
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,358
I'm saying I would have never known what

1493
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,199
to tell them because by the time they're

1494
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,318
seen it and they want to know what I did

1495
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:16,598
on something that was the plant I grew

1496
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,960
months ago yeah it's funny so 30 years

1497
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:21,838
ago there wasn't a lot of information we

1498
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,920
we had to use a lot well in a lot of

1499
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,960
recipes you get from nutrients and stuff

1500
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,720
like that you would actually have to go

1501
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,280
in and figure out your own recipe and be

1502
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:31,639
combination of stuff that like because

1503
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,280
the recipes that they gave you on the

1504
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:35,558
back of the bottle yeah I mean you could

1505
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,160
do three-part from GH and that would

1506
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:38,960
give you consistent but that wasn't the

1507
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:41,118
best you wanted something better yeah

1508
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,880
yeah yeah it got you through but how can

1509
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,119
we improve this dude and now it's like

1510
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,079
you can use Cutting Edge like Uncle John

1511
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,559
Cutting Edge you whether it's Cutting

1512
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:53,480
Edge United Frontline

1513
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,640
Athena uh you know we could house and

1514
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,920
House and Garden I mean all these

1515
00:55:55,639 --> 00:56:01,199
companies if you follow the recipes that

1516
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,318
you get from these companies you will

1517
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:06,279
typically get good results yeah you know

1518
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:08,519
it's like just following Te You B

1519
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,359
basically just following step by step

1520
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:12,639
from what they give you you're going to

1521
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:14,279
get good results whereas 30 years ago or

1522
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,239
even 20 years ago that wasn't

1523
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,720
necessarily the case you would have to

1524
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,358
use that and then we need a little bit

1525
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:22,639
of liquid Karma or we use dark energy or

1526
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:24,318
these different things and we use these

1527
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,318
to get better results and you can still

1528
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:28,679
do some of that stuff but a lot of times

1529
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,639
just right out the gate you can follow

1530
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:33,558
the recipe that's on the back um yeah I

1531
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:37,199
mean I like when I first started off too

1532
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:39,200
one my f i did the soil I I did the fox

1533
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,358
farm and you know they their little

1534
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:44,078
nutrient line Farm's great wasn't super

1535
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:46,598
the best but dude like I said it will

1536
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,318
get you through I think it gets you to a

1537
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:50,599
good spot like I said that uh to know if

1538
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:52,599
you like this or not you know what I'm

1539
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:55,838
saying and uh like I said all you got to

1540
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:57,480
do is read the instructions so like

1541
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:00,000
companies like Cana and these other

1542
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,679
companies they they you know that we can

1543
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
name all the nutrient companies we want

1544
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:07,519
uh a lot of them spend a tons of money

1545
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,280
on research and development to give you

1546
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:11,519
an amazing recipe that works really good

1547
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,400
uh and then it's just a personal

1548
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,000
preference of what do I like do I want

1549
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,960
it to taste amazing do I want it to look

1550
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,440
amazing because I think they all have

1551
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,639
yeah different boxes that they check

1552
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,920
when you use them and yeah for sure for

1553
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,960
sure yeah like I said you can you can

1554
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,039
start

1555
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,280
tweaking that that recipe a hair you

1556
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,480
know what I'm saying I wouldn't go crazy

1557
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,960
and just half nutrients or whatever for

1558
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,440
the most part I just use the stock

1559
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:38,000
recipes and we might adjust a little bit

1560
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,880
on um you know and I have a guy that

1561
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,679
comes in and helps me do that he's much

1562
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,798
better than I am and it's like because

1563
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,519
just if you're if you're doing 50/50 on

1564
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:47,639
something that's like a two-part you

1565
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:51,400
want to go 6040 it's not just a straight

1566
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:53,000
6040 because there's this amazing change

1567
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,559
that happens when you you do it and it

1568
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,159
doesn't adjust perfectly this chemical

1569
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:02,519
change that happens when you add the a

1570
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:04,399
to the B so but you you're doing 6040 of

1571
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:06,079
A and B of one of the other or something

1572
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,798
so if we're running like a

1573
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,359
6040 let's say we're doing 50/50 I'll

1574
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:12,239
use United as an example because we're

1575
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:13,400
use I mean we we're in R&amp;D facility so

1576
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,639
we test everybody's stuff but we're

1577
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,160
using United right now and we went from

1578
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,719
a 5050 and we were getting a little bit

1579
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,038
of stretch and we were getting tip

1580
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:26,118
burning right with it just straight

1581
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:28,160
50/50 yeah and so we had our guy uh who

1582
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:29,838
works with United he's amazing he came

1583
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:33,679
in he's like we should probably just try

1584
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:35,279
a 6040 and we'll go 60/40 and see how

1585
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,358
that does with what what you're doing

1586
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,839
and we're going to lower it from 3 EC

1587
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,719
down to 2.5 EC we're going to go a

1588
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:43,400
little bit lighter yeah right and then

1589
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:45,719
we're going to go 6040 and we'll see how

1590
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,358
it does problem solved that's what they

1591
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:49,959
recommended you and he there's a

1592
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,838
calculation that he used yeah to help us

1593
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,559
get to that perfect 6040 because it's

1594
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:55,599
not super when you're tie trading these

1595
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:56,640
things yeah it's not just straightway

1596
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,400
forward

1597
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,879
so it's it's great having somebody I

1598
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,200
mean and this is following their recipe

1599
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,280
right yeah but well and another thing is

1600
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,000
like you said you reached out to a

1601
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,440
nutrient line or whatever if you're

1602
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,519
having problems man call these people

1603
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,760
call these people yeah the Tex them hit

1604
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,920
them up message on Instagram whatever

1605
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,359
they will get back to you most of them

1606
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,838
will get back to you and these these

1607
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:19,598
companies care about their customers

1608
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,000
they want people to be their customers

1609
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,760
obviously so yeah yeah I mean I think

1610
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,079
customer service is half of it you're

1611
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,480
good customer service if you want a

1612
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:28,200
business and you want to be successful

1613
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,240
customer service is key for sure for

1614
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:32,239
sure yeah that's what I'm saying um I

1615
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,439
mean like I said R I run the rise

1616
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:37,838
nutrients uh it was my first time doing

1617
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,720
Hydro I actually got them for soil and

1618
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:41,239
uh like I said I was doing other soil

1619
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:43,759
nutrients at the time but I wanted to

1620
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:45,439
start my buckets and so I hit them a

1621
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,920
message I think it was just on Instagram

1622
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,838
I just left them a voice message saying

1623
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,240
hey I got your nutrients are these good

1624
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:52,318
for hydro buckets and they text me back

1625
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:53,798
of course they are you know what I'm

1626

1638
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:18,039
nothing wrong with hitting up the

1639
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,240
manufacturer and going okay how can I

1640

make this the best it could be or you

1641
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,759
know I mean I I do like if you got like

1642
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,400
a TV or something that wasn't working

1643
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,039
that you thought was supposed to operate

1644
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,000
you go back and say hey dude this TV

1645
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:30,240
ain't working the volum doesn't work

1646
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,519
what's going on then why don't you go

1647
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:32,759
back and say hey dude these nutrients

1648
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:34,119
ain't working the way I thought and

1649
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,200
they're like well they'll ask you what

1650
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:37,960
are you doing how are you doing it so

1651
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,919
that's once again write it down so you

1652
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,119
can tell them the correct and accurate

1653
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,760
information if you're telling them

1654
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,358
something wrong and they tell you to try

1655
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,160
to correct it and maybe that wasn't even

1656
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,639
the problem to with there's so many

1657
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:51,519
little things that beyond the recipe

1658
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:53,679
like if you're filtering your water like

1659
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:55,440
filtering for chlorine or whatever yeah

1660
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:58,480
using a basic filter like you're going

1661
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,559
to run it's going to run a a different

1662
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,880
different pH right coming out so you can

1663
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:05,880
have pH issues that you're not sometimes

1664
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,798
you need ph up sometimes you need PH

1665
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,559
down yeah it's just and then depending

1666
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:13,599
on where you're located in the country

1667
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:15,640
in the time of year you're your EC the

1668
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,359
yeah basically can fluctuate your EC and

1669
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:20,598
your pH can fluctuate just from using

1670
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:23,400
City Water yeah yeah I I just use tap

1671
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:27,480
water whatever uh I'll sit it out

1672
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,280
declinate uh for 24 hours and so yeah um

1673
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,400
I I just have to pH Down normally after

1674
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,559
I dechlorinate it let it sit out it's

1675
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,680
like 8 3ish mainly is what I normally

1676
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:39,960
get sometimes eight you know you always

1677
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:41,558
got to check it is the best thing uh but

1678
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,318
yeah it's mine's always about eight and

1679
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:44,559
I always just I just declinate I'll let

1680
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:46,798
it sit out you know what I'm saying

1681
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,559
what's your EC at coming out of the tap

1682
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:51,159
I don't parts per I don't I don't test I

1683
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,798
don't have an EC uhuh really yeah dude

1684
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:57,078
I'm I'm I'm the kiss keep it simple

1685
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:59,119
stupid for sure uh

1686
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:01,480
I like learning and I learn about

1687
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,559
certain things when I need to at time

1688
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,719
but that's saying if uh if I'm not

1689
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:07,920
running into the problem at the time I'm

1690
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:09,199
trying I don't need extra stuff in my

1691
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,798
head I guess you know what I'm saying I

1692
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:14,558
got too much stuff balancing around as

1693
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,960
it is uh so yeah um like I said I

1694
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,680
haven't even had to go down that road

1695
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,240
people have asked me all the time you

1696
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:21,038

1697
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:23,159

YouTube um it's three of us they

1707
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:49,719
actually were the two that came up with

1708
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:51,440
it uh they were bouncing ideas off of

1709
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:54,399
each other for a while how to get

1710
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,480
something started uh they start off on

1711
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,599
Instagram uh they asked asked me one

1712
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,440
week if I'd be a part of it and I said

1713
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:02,880
yeah yeah dude that's cool like me and

1714
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,000
El first started uh we were messaging

1715
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,519
and hang you know helping each other

1716
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,119
back and forth for a while and then he

1717
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:10,798
he knew Canal Chris and so they started

1718
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,838
and they were asking me if I'd jump on I

1719
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:16,038
said yeah we're having problems with the

1720
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:18,038
Instagram of course uh so I think we

1721
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,680
only did a couple episodes there so we

1722
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:22,760
moved to YouTube uh having way more

1723
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:26,278
success I think we're at like 500

1724
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:28,680
subscribers we've been doing it for

1725
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:32,798
six months now or something this is

1726
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:36,960
season one we grew out the uh ponia glue

1727
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:40,000
Skies from uh crop culture uh so yeah

1728
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,358
we're having fun with that um so yeah

1729
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,798
it's the three of us they were like I

1730
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:48,038
said they were doing it they asked me to

1731
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:49,559
be on and uh I'm the the it's the slogan

1732
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:51,839
is grow with the show so yeah you can

1733
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:54,079
get the genetics and so yeah uh the

1734
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,440
thing is we'll give you the germination

1735
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,200
uh date when we're germinating so it's

1736
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,798
it's a it's a community thing we're

1737
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:01,558
trying to get people to come along and

1738
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:03,480
grow their cannabis if you have

1739
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:05,160
questions or you're scared to start

1740
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,400
growing this is what we're you know

1741
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:08,920
that's what they uh put it together for

1742
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,559
I think L is the one that actually came

1743
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,400
up with the seed the Harvest podcast

1744
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:16,440
name and yeah just you know the the idea

1745
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,200
of it of you know helping people to do

1746
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,519

1827
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:24,558
someone who can go to a a ree show and

if you're struggling dude keep trying

1831

keep trying keep trying um like I said

1832
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:41,639
I've had problems like that um I'm 44

1833
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:43,400
now um since I was 14 so 30 years I've

1834
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,400
pretty much well not I've been clean for

1835
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,920
a while now but you know what I'm saying

1836
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:51,119
um i' I've struggled with it numerous

1837
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,000
times I've tried uh and i' all every

1838
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,599
time I was doing that I take a night off

1839
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,278
and I just sit home and smoke weed and

1840
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:04,079
that felt so good yeah you know what I'm

1841
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:07,199
saying uh I felt like who I was uh just

1842
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:10,160
from where I came from I felt like that

1843
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:12,399
that is what I had to do uh I felt like

1844
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:15,399
in the morning when I I I drank first

1845
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:18,239
thing in the morning um I'd open up a

1846
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:20,679
bottle and I I'd I'd stare I didn't want

1847
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,678
to man I didn't want to drink you know

1848
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,119
what I'm saying I think maybe that point

1849
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:26,199
it has to you have to get to a point

1850
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:29,759
where you are [ __ ] sick and tired of

1851
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:33,079
it really uh at that last end I was like

1852
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:36,479
I'd look at that bottle and and i' you

1853
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:38,198
know it's just [ __ ] horrible so yeah

1854
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,039
like I said it's and it's not even just

1855
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:42,559
the actual cannabis itself like At first

1856
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,399
I just still just you know getting

1857
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:49,120
cannabis from people and that it's

1858
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:51,519
helping me uh but man without the

1859
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:53,679
growing that changes I've never been so

1860
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,359
happier in my life I've never really

1861
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,480
been so much happier in my life uh like

1862
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:01,079
I said just drinking all the time waking

1863
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:04,000
up with a hangover uh thinking you got

1864
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:05,519
to do these drugs to get through the day

1865
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,960
because you got to hangover you're

1866
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,719
drinking constantly throughout the day

1867
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:14,319
um it just it's takes a toll on your

1868
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:16,880
body for sure and without cannabis I

1869
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:20,400

polluting your body uh I mean one of the

1896
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,719
first things that people would ask me

for one thing and uh to me and I iect I

1900
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,560
do believe that to a certain degree I

1901
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,760
think it makes you weak I think people

1902
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:30,600
consume it too much I think it makes you

1903
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,880
weaker um it just it's it's not good for

1904
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,880
your body if you booze all the time

1905
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,560
you'll you'll definitely feel it in your

1906
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,239
body for

1907
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,760
sure definitely not for everybody no no

1908
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:42,599
it's def it's not definitely not for me

1909
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,719
no more for sure yeah I don't think it

1910
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,719
ever really was for me I just like I

1911
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:51,840
said I thought that's what it was yeah I

1912
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:54,679
mean cannabis in general is it makes the

1913
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,800
world a better place I think alcohol uh

1914
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:58,279
in a lot of ways does the opposite

1915
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,600
unforunately and I think people there

1916
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:00,800
are people that can have a good time on

1917
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,920
alcohol and there's nothing wrong I

1918
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,800
don't judge people either way no to each

1919
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,199
their own to each their own but like so

1920
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,560
cannabis definitely makes the world a

1921
01:11:06,198 --> 01:11:11,879
better place and for sure 100% I'm all

1922
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:14,080
for making the world a better place and

1923
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,760
you know leaving something to the Next

1924
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,640
Generation and trying to lead by example

1925
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,440
I don't always lead by example I do the

1926
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,560
best I can and I think that's we can

1927
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:24,479
strive for the the best we can do and I

1928
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,159
think that's okay we're all human beings

1929
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,359
we're Nobody's Perfect no nobody's

1930
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:30,639
perfect you know there's perfect is

1931
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:32,519
imperfect yeah for sure for sure I mean

1932
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,679
that's that's that's a perfect saying

1933
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:38,360
right there you know what I'm saying

1934
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:40,039
yeah uh yeah I mean that's if you try to

1935
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:41,119
reach Perfection of whatever you're

1936
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:42,560
thinking you're going to drive yourself

1937
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,519
crazy you know what I'm saying but I

1938
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,400
think the goal is perfection right we

1939
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,520
want to we want to strive to be the best

1940
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:51,079
we can be yeah and along the way if you

1941
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,440
make mistakes yes you want to improve

1942
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:56,479
always impr gradual Improvement is great

1943
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:58,719
that's the goal is to gradually improve

1944
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:00,198
and maybe you know I drank this weekend

1945
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,319
or whatever I'm not I'm trying not to

1946
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:03,678
drink as much so I'm I'm actually

1947
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:05,479
achieving what I'm trying to do is by

1948
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,199
not drinking as much no yeah doesn't

1949
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:10,079
drink there's a couple of people online

1950
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:12,238
that I talked to that I I uh I've helped

1951
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:15,399
out that like you know

1952
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:18,599
um he he posted something and he was

1953
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:21,238
like oh [ __ ] I you know so many years

1954
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,039
down the drain he posted his drink um

1955
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:25,599
and saw actually we're pretty good

1956
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:28,079
friends now I just told him I said dude

1957
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,960
um I said it's not about the the time

1958
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:31,559
that you weren't drinking and that you

1959
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,119
just lost it's about what you're gonna

1960
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,800
do after this yeah you know what I'm

1961
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:36,279
saying what are you doing at this point

1962
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,159
all right you [ __ ] one day up you

1963
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:39,920
drank you probably feel like [ __ ] you

1964
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:42,599
know what I'm saying so use this as a

1965
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,920
reminder for one thing and get back at

1966
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,960
it and don't [ __ ] drink again and if

1967
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,960
it happens again you just you you know

1968
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,600
you're a human being and all you can do

1969
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:54,520
is work on yourself and sometimes don't

1970
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,440
be too hard on yourself while you're

1971
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,960
doing it sometimes to I think that's one

1972
01:12:56,439 --> 01:13:01,039
of the best pieces of advice for people

1973
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:04,480
is don't be too hard on yourself uh when

1974
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:06,920
you [ __ ] up as long as you recognize

1975
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,638
that you [ __ ] up and made a mistake

1976
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,279
and and try to move forward from that

1977
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:12,880
whether it's alcohol or anything well

1978
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:15,359
that's what I'd use as a a CR or an

1979
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:18,159
excuse for when I when I would try to

1980
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,759
get clean and sober uh I'd maybe do it

1981
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,238
for a little while if I start drinking

1982
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,039
or whatever I'm like well [ __ ] it now

1983
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:25,279
you know what I'm saying yeah uh I'm I'm

1984
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:27,880
a drinker you know what I'm saying can't

1985
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:30,198
control myself I went back to it uh so

1986
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,600
yeah I like I said you exactly if you

1987
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:34,638
mess up you're not perfect correct it

1988
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:37,280
and try to you know correct it for the

1989
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:38,840
future yeah I'm not a big fan of AA

1990
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,960
personally and I think it works for some

1991
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:44,520
people I think it's great for prr uh

1992
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:46,960
yeah me neither I mean maybe here too

1993
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,840
cuz like in Texas if you work it over

1994
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,119
there and you tell them what I'm doing

1995
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,719
they'll you're not working the program

1996
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:53,359
because you're using cannabis or

1997
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,359
whatever you can smoke cigarettes yeah

1998
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:58,079
yeah yeah you can smoke you can change

1999
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:59,359
yeah stupid yeah I don't do AA either I

2000
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:00,760
if you need it and there's nothing wrong

2001
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,399
with it I think it's great for certain

2002
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:05,600
people I think group some people need

2003
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:07,198
that and I think the structure of it

2004
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,120
whatever is perfect for some people is

2005
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,759
just not not my cup of tea and I've had

2006
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:14,800
friends that have have had great success

2007
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,800
been sober you know for for 20 years

2008
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,279
yeah you know from AA and they still go

2009
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,279
to meetings and that's great for them

2010
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:22,119
and that works for them and yeah yeah no

2011
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:27,000
I'm not I'm me yeah same thing I'm not

2012
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:29,679
an AA member or I don't go to AA uh yeah

2013
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,359
like I said I don't I've tried it before

2014
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:35,039
and um like half the time D half those

2015
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:37,839
people in there are getting sent there

2016
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:39,880
because they're on paper or something so

2017
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,279
they have to be there I've done it

2018
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,400
before where I've I've been sent there

2019
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:46,039
because I was in trouble and same thing

2020
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,000
I've linked up with people and there's

2021
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,800
been times where I go there actually

2022
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,840
trying to get clean I went out there on

2023
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,639
my own and I ended up leaving with

2024
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,560
somebody drinking and drugging that

2025
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:58,279
night because you know what I'm saying

2026
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,840
you start start people start telling War

2027
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:03,479
Stories and you know what I'm saying

2028
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:05,279
sometimes uh some won't have they try to

2029
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:07,599
tell you don't tell the war stories or

2030
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:10,000
whatnot just talk about what happened

2031
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,600
but it's I saying you're with a group of

2032
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,840
people everybody's going to do their own

2033
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,920
thing and try to do what they want uh

2034
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,520
but yeah like I said majority in my

2035
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,199
feeling is I guarantee about half those

2036
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:25,760
people are forced to be there or

2037
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:28,000
something so well and I think the it's

2038
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,800
the the right path for us it's all

2039
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
different and there's nothing wrong with

2040
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,560
trying everything and seeing what works

2041
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,560
I mean obviously you tried all the drugs

2042
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,880
and you tried all this stuff so trying

2043
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,480
all the different ways to get Sil that's

2044
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,760
all right too you it's like there's

2045
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,559
nothing wrong with going to church if

2046
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:45,000
you think that God will save you or or

2047
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,080
that if you think that maybe that might

2048
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,880
be something that will work I mean bring

2049
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:51,880
that's great I mean I think spiritualism

2050
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,039
and religion and all these things are

2051
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,159
great yeah you know and can be amazing

2052
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:58,639
tools cannabis you can find spiritualism

2053
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:02,279
in cannabis you can yeah you can find a

2054
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:04,000
spiritual path in cannabis or

2055
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:05,399
psychedelics or whatever and there's

2056
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,079
nothing wrong with that either all these

2057
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:10,119
things are great uh ways to try to heal

2058
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:12,039
