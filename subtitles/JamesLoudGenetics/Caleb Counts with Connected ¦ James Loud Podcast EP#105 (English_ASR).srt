How's it going everybody? Welcome to

7
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,399
another episode of the James Loud

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,159
podcast and today our special guest is

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,679
Caleb from Connected. How are you doing

10
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,439
today? I'm doing great. Thanks for

11
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,878
having me. Absolutely, man. So, you're

12
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,439
one of the guests that you're on the hit

13
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,878
list of the original list that I made of

14
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,159
people that I wanted to interview and

15
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,000
we've been going down and checking the

16
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,238
people off and so I'm glad you're here.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
Yeah, I'm glad I finally made it. Um,

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,719
the opportunity came up and I said,

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,159
"Absolutely." Everyone had I I haven't

20
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,158
quite frankly I haven't paid like a ton

21
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,000
of attention to podcasts in general. I

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,840
just listened to like my one or two,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,840
right? And I asked around and everyone's

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
like, "Yeah, that's that's the biggest

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,439
probably if not one of the biggest, the

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
biggest in in cannabis. You got to be on

27
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,199
it." So, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. We've

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
we've worked really hard and I feel like

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
it's it's happened organically. I didn't

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,560
really I was on the Future Cannabis

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,799
Project and did the James Loud show. We

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,519
did 43 episodes there and I said I was

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,439
going to build a studio. I did that and

34
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,438
then we're at we we've done over 100

35
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,879
episodes now. It's pretty wild. You

36
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,319
know, it takes a team. It's so much

37
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,519
bigger than myself and it takes good

38
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,839
guests, right? At the end of the day,

39
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,599
it's all the quality of the podcast

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,799
totally relates to the quality of your

41
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,078
guests and we try to hit the mark with a

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
little bit of everything. So, we don't

43
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,000
go for just one style of guest and it's

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
it's been a fun ride. Yeah, I can tell

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,680
by the hats over here. You've got a

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,880
pretty varied uh guest list. So, sounds

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
like you're mixing it up pretty well,

48
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,959
which is great. I think podcasts run the

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
risk of, you know, kind of going down

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,079
one channel and getting stuck there and

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,238
then you kind of run out of things and

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
you replay guests or whatever, but

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,878
spreading it out amongst the industry.

54
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:20,479
You got vendors, uh, seed guys, flower

55
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,878
guys, we got OGs, we got Luke Scarzo on

56
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,479
here. He did 14 years. And I I like

57
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,079
redundancies for some things, but it's

58
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,719
like you can be you can have too much

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,959
redundancy with podcast guests. But the

60
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,039
beauty of the cannabis industry is now

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,719
as opposed to 20 years ago, you can be

62
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,039
an expert in your field, whether that's

63
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,439
breeding or whether that's, you know,

64
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,878
cultivation or extract, you don't have

65
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,120
to do it all. And back in the day, we

66
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,518
kind of had to do everything.

67
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,200
Yeah. I mean, it feels like I mean, as

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,920
the it feels like the walls are closing

69
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,000
in, not on us, but like on the cannabis

70
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,958
industry, right? And and we're finding

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,719
ourselves kind of having feeling like we

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,519
have to do more and more or at least

73
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,000
bring the people closer and closer. So,

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
I I wish that was more at least, you

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,039
know, for us, I wish that's been more of

76
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,560
the case where you don't have to do

77
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,039
everything. Distribution's a good

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
example like God's just like doing

79
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,318
something you never wanted to do. Run a

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
run a crew of trucks. I think we have

81
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,560
like 26 trucks. It's it's mindboggling,

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
right? Well, and I get that totally and

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,598
I would agree, but I feel like you can

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
hire somebody to run the trucks. You

85
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,359
don't have to run that like run that

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
department, right? You can have

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,239
departments. Before it was like where

88
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,199
you're electricians and carpenters and

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,200
all these things. Yeah. Like

90
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,199
individually individually, but like I

91
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,079
I'm totally under the I love the

92
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,158
umbrella model. I love the collaboration

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
model. I think anymore you have to

94
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,439
collaborate. You have to work with other

95
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,958
like-minded people if you want to be

96
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,318
successful. And you need some of that

97
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,479
vertical integration. You might not have

98
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,399
to be fully vertically integrated, but

99
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,079
you definitely need I mean, I think

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
genetics is a huge thing. If you can do

101
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
that in house, if you grow good

102
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,518
cannabis, you can do pheno hunting,

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
right? I feel like yes, that's the the

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,760
ticket cuz if you don't grow well

105
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,120
enough, you might as well have somebody

106
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,399
else doing that part, right? And if

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
you're just going to grow mids, it

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
doesn't even matter anyway these days.

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,519
Yeah. And you know what I've noticed? So

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,760
that question comes up a lot like why

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
like why is your genetic program better

112
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,560
or different? And it's not that it's

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
necessarily better. It's not that we're

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,280
doing anything unique. Genetics and

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,680
pheno hunting is not crazy complicated.

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,079
It's it's the whole thing, the whole

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,079
chain of events. It's it's the the

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
deciding what to cross with, then doing

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
the pheno hunt, making the selections,

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,519
and then probably the biggest component

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,439
of it is getting it to market and

122
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,079
finding the stage for it, right? And I

123
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,600
think that's where a lot of people uh,

124
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,918
you know, it kind of goes back to having

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,439
to do everything yourself. I think a lot

126
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,039
of people continue to try to do

127
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,839
everything themselves and they want to

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,680
name it or, you know, they want to

129
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,679
design the label. I mean, we've fallen

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
victim to that. I've I've had to let go

131
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
of more and more to give it more chance

132
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,400
of of success, right? Because what I

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,120
like in my narrow vision, especially as

134
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,439
as I've gotten older, you know, doesn't

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,600
always hit and and being able to pass

136
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,839
that off. But I think I've seen you I've

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,639
seen a lot of genetics that were really

138
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,279
good and worth, you know, quite a bit.

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,199
In fact, even though we have the vast

140
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,119
majority of what we grow commercially,

141
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
probably like 90% of it is something

142
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
that we developed in house, but that

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,759
other 10% is stuff we've either got from

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
some friend or whatever or so sourced

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,360
off of clone menus, just random like

146
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,199
weird names, you know, and we've brought

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,038
it in and we're like, "Holy [ __ ] this

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,038
is yielding, you know, high teacher."

149
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,399
It's like hitting all the marks and I've

150
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,560
never even heard of this strain. It's

151
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,478
probably something relabeled, right? And

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,038
it's something else someone made and

153
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,360
didn't wasn't able to to take it to the

154
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,839
big times. So much of that happens. I've

155
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,038
seen so much good stuff too that is just

156
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,959
not been in the right hands. Uh Gelato

157
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,319
41, I think you're kind of synonymous

158
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,918
with Gelato 41 to a degree. Yeah. Um we

159
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,478
I wish I could take credit for creating

160
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,198
it. You know, they they created it. uh

161
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,959
the Cookie Fam guys created it and then

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,199
but we were the first ones to grow it

163
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:03,279
commercially and and then Gelato 41

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,759
still to this day is one of the best

165
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,239
parents to breed with. I I' I've bred

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,600
with it myself. I 100% agree. It is the

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,079
And the funny thing is is like you look

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
at Gelato 33, you look at any of the

169
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,758
other gelatoes and there's a lot of

170
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,520
instability with the genetics. Whereas

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,960
gelato 41, it just it it basically

172
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,639
translates to the parents. you can put

173
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,879
it out in a field if you if you use it

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,478
as a as a parent especially as a donor u

175
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,839
you can cross it with stuff and you're

176
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,159
going to get a pretty consistent

177
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,519
expression whereas gelato 33 like the

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,759
S1's for example of gelato 33 you'll get

179
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,000
25 different phenotypes that are very

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,879
different right whereas gelato 41 you're

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,360
getting only a handful and I feel like

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,079
it translates to strength structure all

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,360
the it checks a lot of the boxes yeah it

184
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,599
really does and and as as the perfect

185
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,919
parent, I consider that to mean that

186
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,000
it's not dominating. Like it's a very

187
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,478
strong presence. It's very clear that

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319
it's part of it, but also like when I I

189
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,159
think about gelade when people ask us

190
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,439
all the time when we crossed it with the

191
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,000
lemon tree and it's just the perfect

192
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,319
pairing of the two of them. It looks

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,639
much more like gelato but smells like

194
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,280
gelade and the flavor or smells like the

195
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,319
the lemon tree but with that hint of the

196
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,559
the gelato back end. It's it just really

197
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,280
it doesn't overpower anything, but it

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
never sees, you know, its presence. Like

199
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,799
you always it's very clear that it's

200
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,959
part of the package. I really like that

201
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,560
when we're breeding. Yeah. I love when

202
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,638
you can take two parents and then

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
improve upon them. A lot of times I see

204
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,160
this happening more and more is where

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,000
guys make a cross and it's not better

206
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,840
than either one of the parents and it's

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,680
like that that has a lot to do with feno

208
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,119
hunting, but also stuff on paper

209
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
sometimes sounds a lot better than the

210
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
reality of it. You know, Skittles times

211
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
gelato 41. It's it's amazing, but

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,519
there's a lot of work that goes into

213
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
finding good phenotypes. Um, and I think

214
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,318
some people don't have the

215
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,360
infrastructure set up to be able to do

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,319
large scale hunts. Uh, and it's like you

217
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,759
got to go through a lot of plants

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,280
sometimes. Sometimes you don't, but

219
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
sometimes you really do. What do you

220
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,799
think's the right number? I think it's

221
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,120
different on everything cuz I just

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,160
popped a bunch I popped a bunch of drips

223
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,319
that I made, which is uh zeruns and

224
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,840
grape gas and it's just absolutely

225
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,240
amazing. 20 of them my guys wanted to

226
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,159
keep out of 40. M right. And it's like

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,680
so sometimes you get lucky and it's like

228
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,720
and out of that we we narrowed it down

229
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,959
to five that are really special but

230
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
that's still a home run. Five out of 40

231
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,918
is insane. That's crazy. It's crazy. You

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,000
know what I mean? Usually it's one out

233
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,240
of 100. I like that 1%. I want the one

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,918
percentile because I think a lot of guys

235
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,519
they they go through 20 or 30 and

236
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,439
they're missing something. They might be

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,519
missing the winner, you know? But

238
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,039
another way I look at it as a as a whole

239
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
room, like if you're popping stuff,

240
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,759
you're going to find winners in that

241
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,039
room. Even if you were to pop 10 of

242
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,720
this, you know, you might not find

243
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,559
anything in that 10, but the next 10,

244
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,480
you might find something good. But I

245
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,719
really I like to keep it around 50. I

246
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
think 50 is a good number. 100 is ideal,

247
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
but it's based on our your

248
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
infrastructure and your setup, too. So,

249
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,839
for us, I think 50 is pretty good, and

250
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,159
we're constantly going through 60 lights

251
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,760
of plants. So, and we do that multiple

252
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,838
times. So, what about you? You know, I I

253
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,200
I agree with you. I think in a perfect

254
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,920
world, it's about a hundred. Um we we

255
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,160
have to catch cast such a wide net for

256
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:24,479
to keep that genetic, you know, that

257
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,480
fresh genetic uh launch uh calendar um

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,839
rolling in the wreck market. And now

259
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
that we've launched our third brand,

260
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
Smok and Promises, we don't really have

261
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,879
the I mean we do I think we do five a

262
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,480
year and one of them I think we go big

263
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,240
and we do three you know three 100. Um

264
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,600
but the majority of our hunts are

265
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,440
between 30 and 50. Yeah. and it's

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,240
produced a lot of good results, but I

267
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,839
often times find myself, you know, you

268
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,759
where you do a cross that, you know,

269
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,080
there's just no doubt in my mind that it

270
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,000
should and will produce something great

271
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,879
and then you just wasted, you know, 3

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,480
months because you did a 50 or a 30 and

273
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,799
you didn't get anything out of it or you

274
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
find yourself trying to nudge something

275
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,559
into the winning spot when it really

276
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,319
doesn't deserve to be on the stage, you

277
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,759
know? Yeah. It's so tough because I feel

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
the same way because I get attached to

279
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,360
like this cross being so good and then

280
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,279
all of a sudden we're looking at the

281
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,879
finished material and it's like so

282
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,559
sometimes we have to run stuff twice too

283
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,559
where it's like okay well we didn't grow

284
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,159
it that good this time we need to really

285
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,359
focus on these because I know there's

286
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,919
something in there and sometimes you hit

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,000
it and sometimes you don't but uh I've

288
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,360
been able to detach myself and you have

289
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
to callull a lot of stuff. You know what

290
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
I mean? I think that's a that's a sign

291
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,078
of a good breeder too. Someone who's

292
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,600
able to just get rid of it and make that

293
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,479
decision like this is not going to work

294
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,079
right. I had to pull myself out of a lot

295
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,320
of that process like because I have the

296
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,519
hardest time letting things go. I like

297
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,519
you know want to see the best in

298
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,759
everyone including the fenos. I'm like

299
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,399
but this I can tell it can be someone

300
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,078
totally you know and so I had to just re

301
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,679
remove myself you know we we have a

302
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,759
pretty comprehensive process. We've

303
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,159
incorporated a number of people and a

304
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,679
pretty uh uh a good system, a scoring

305
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,439
system. And if it doesn't meet the

306
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,159
scoring, I mean, I could pull rank and

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,600
be like, "No, this one this is going to

308
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,879
I don't care that people didn't like it.

309
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,278
We're going to give it another shot." I

310
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,120
try to not do it very often, right? Um

311
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,759
but we've we've we're in a pretty good

312
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
system that prevents me from keeping too

313
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,838
much and or putting things forward that

314
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,919
really shouldn't. And do you guys do

315
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,720
analytics as well with everything? Yeah.

316
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:30,719
Yeah, we we test everything for turpps

317
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,480
and um and TH and cannabonoids uh and

318
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
document everything. I mean our I've

319
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,320
seen some of your lists actually, so for

320
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,040
sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean like really

321
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,120
extensive uh spreadsheets. Yeah. I mean

322
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,719
it's daunting. I can't even you know

323
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,560
they're like oh reference you know line

324
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,879
1,300. I'm like no I'm not looking at

325
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,518
spreadsheets that go that in that

326
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:55,200
indepth. So we have a great uh R&amp;D

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,480
department. Uh we have a a PhD out of

328
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,720
Cornell running the R&amp;D and he comes

329
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,120
from a data background and and I think

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
he was working in tomatoes before and so

331
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,039
just he was just like collecting data

332
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,679
and and so now he collects the data,

333
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,799
organizes the data and then helps, you

334
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,879
know, present it in a in a a way that we

335
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,399
can absorb it and then give feedback and

336
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,159
make quick decisions. And that's been

337
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,919
instrumental. That's allowed us to go

338
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,078
way wider. Yeah, you know, if it was

339
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,078
just me and Ted, you know, just knocking

340
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,159
our heads on the wall, we'd probably

341
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,519
still just be doing large, you know,

342
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,000
larger 50 to 100 feno hunts. Keep it a

343
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,639
little bit more simple and and less data

344
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,078
and, you know, a lot of a lot of that.

345
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,600
Well, let's smoke it and see how it

346
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,719
goes. And it's like, but you can't smoke

347
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,079
everything. And that's the other thing

348
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,278
people don't understand. It's like, I

349
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,799
would love to be able to smoke

350
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,200
everything. We have 60 lights. There's

351
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,719
just no way you're going to do it. But I

352
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,320
can tell a lot of times what's going to

353
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
smoke and what's not going to smoke. at

354
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,680
least I have a good idea and that

355
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,519
doesn't always translate but most of the

356
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,159
time at least we have a good idea of

357
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,679
stuff based on the nose especially

358
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:03,439
interesting so for us that has not or at

359
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:06,000
least me that has not rung true I've you

360
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,680
know I was I mean I came from brokering

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,759
wheat right and that's how I came up in

362
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,319
the space I was not a grower I figured

363
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,958
it out because I realized we had to like

364
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
that was an area that was underserved

365
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,078
and a lot of people weren't doing a

366
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,560
great job when I when I decided to

367
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,199
learn, right? But, you know, I'm just

368
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,679
look in the bag, smell it, looks, is

369
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,480
this going to sell and at what price is

370
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,319
how my entire mind worked. And so, I'm

371
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,200
still, you know, burdened by that a

372
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,800
little bit. So, I cannot I haven't been

373
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,879
able to adjust my lens. And so, I'm I

374
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,519
find myself picking I'm like this smell

375
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,278
and smell and looks smell and looks. And

376
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,200
then we have what we refer to as the

377
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,120
sensory panel now. It's like these taste

378
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
makers all throughout the state that we

379
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,519
make they get drops of of all the

380
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,639
different stages of the of the breeding

381
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,799
and and testing process. And I find that

382
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,799
I'm wrong more like what they're saying

383
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,359
translates like they're picking fenos

384
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,278
that aren't as good looking. You know,

385
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,600
the the noses are a little bit more

386
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,439
nuanced and you know, so I can after

387
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,040
they kind of explain why they made a

388
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
certain selection on the nose, I can see

389
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,039
it. But some of the, you know, the looks

390
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,360
that they're choosing are not, they're

391
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,120
not like the best bag appeal. Yeah. But

392
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
I think they are doing what you're

393
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,879
referring to. They've just they've just

394
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,399
they've trained themselves. And I grew

395
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,799
up with cat piss. It was the ugliest

396
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,519
weed on the planet. And it was amazing

397
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,958
in the effect, the smell, the taste. I I

398
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,078
thought it was amazing, but it was ugly.

399
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,599
When we used to get it, it was like

400
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,359
little bracks in the bag. A lot of times

401
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
it was just shreds in a bag, and we pay

402
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,759
$60 for an eighth of it. Yeah. So, I

403
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,000
grew up like liking ugly weed. And so

404
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,078
that really kind of has taken away to

405
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,919
where okay, how does it smell? How does

406
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,198
it taste? And how does it make you feel?

407
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,360
Uh my friend died last year, 420, and I

408
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,559
went back to breeding for effect. Like

409
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,399
really, cuz that was kind of out of the

410
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,399
equation. I'm a chef by trade as well.

411
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,559
So it's like, okay, let's go for flavor.

412
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,320
I want flavor. I want the turppiest,

413
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,759
most unique flavor that I can get. If I

414
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
can get some green tea ice cream, I'm

415
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,679
loving it. You know, something

416
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,198
different. Yeah. But uh he passed and

417
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,799
you know, he was questioning me the week

418
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,198
before he passed. He really was kind of

419
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,919
like talking about breeding for effect

420
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,679
and he gifted me his seed collection uh

421
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,039
which the money from the seeds that

422
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,799
we're going to sell are going back to

423
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,159
his kids and on 420 we're actually

424
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,000
starting to launch those seeds on our

425
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,679
website. But he was all about breeding

426
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,879
for effect and his stuff tasted good and

427
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,719
we're fina hunting through some of the

428
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,639
stuff right now and it's like wow good

429
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,839
flavor good effect but really trying to

430
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,039
get that focus back on feel good weed.

431
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,320
How does it make you feel? Do you want

432
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,000
to feel up? Do you want to feel down?

433
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
and having that as part of the equation

434
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
instead of it just like does it taste

435
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,198
good? Yeah. The whole effect thing is

436
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,958
just a daunting way to approach things.

437
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,719
Uh and that goes back to like what my

438
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,319
tastes and my experiences are. Right.

439
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,920
Right. And I'm and I'm going through it

440
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,759
right now with my wife. She I married uh

441
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,519
her. She she just moved here from Costa

442
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,000
Rica like three and a half years ago.

443
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,720
And she just, you know, she up until the

444
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,320
day we met was still just smoking

445
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,160
whatever, you know, was available. There

446
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
was no strain. she if there was she

447
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,120
never paid attention to it even though

448
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,958
Costa Rica actually has a pretty good

449
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,120
indoors a lot of old school NorCal

450
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,879
surfers down there that set up grow ops.

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,600
Um, so they have some pretty good weed.

452
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,198
And um, and so we're going through it

453
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
and we're we're trying to find out like

454
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,278
she didn't believe she thought it was

455
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,039
just [ __ ] you know, that that weed

456
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,799
had different effects. Like she claimed

457
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
she never I think it just she was never

458
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,919
paying attention or she was smoking

459
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,879
always in the in the similar mood or,

460
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,240
you know, occasion, right? And as she

461
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,679
started to go through some of the stuff

462
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,480
that I'm bringing home and actually

463
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,559
she's an amazing joint and blunt roller

464
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
so she sees everything and started to

465
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,000
pay attention to the names and started

466
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:50,399
to realize that biscotti and biscotti in

467
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,759
particular but the gelato heavy fenos

468
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,399
give her what I would describe as as

469
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,720
like what what a typical sativa like you

470
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
know upbeat like a little bit of anxiety

471
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
you know the opposite of what most

472
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,798
people exactly And so it's like it's

473
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
unfolding right before me. You know,

474
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,119
sometimes I'm always like, ah, you know,

475
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,000
it's it's hard, but it's an amazing

476
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,558
plant. It's a complex plant. Um, and I

477
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,959
think what we've definitely noticed is,

478
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:21,838
you know, you whatever, you know, we're

479
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:25,199
experiencing and what we uh communicate

480
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,838
that we or we think you will experience,

481
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,279
that tends to be what most people are

482
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,879
are seeing. But then you're getting the

483
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,798
outliers where they're getting the exact

484
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,960
opposite. Totally. It's so subjective

485
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,798
and people are like, "Well, taste isn't

486
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
these things are." No, they are very

487
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,720
It's just like with wine or any sort of

488
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
food. But then with the effect, it adds

489
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
a whole another dimension to that. And

490
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,639
it's like cuz our body chemistries are

491
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,679
so uniquely different from one person to

492
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
the next, you can have different

493
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
effects. White Thorn Rose, I think, is a

494
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,200
good example where across the board, a

495
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,038
lot of people get that same feeling from

496
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,679
it. It's just feel good weed. I don't

497
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,359
think it's strong. I wouldn't classify

498
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:03,360
it as uh you know narcotic or sedative

499
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,558
uh or stimulating, right? It's somewhere

500
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,639
in the middle that just makes you feel

501
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,918
really good. And it's one of those

502
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
things I could smoke in the morning,

503
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,000
evening, afternoon, but I can do that

504
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,399
with sour diesel, too, right? So, we can

505
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,519
go back to sour. I I love sour diesel. I

506
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,798
love the way it makes me feel,

507
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,480
especially uh sunrown sour diesel. I I

508
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,079
smoked on a bunch of it for the last

509
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,640
like few months and it just makes me

510
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,079
feel really good. And sometimes we just

511
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,280
connect with different genetics, you

512
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,038
know. Yeah. I haven't had uh a good sour

513
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,558
diesel. So, there's been a bunch of

514
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,558
[ __ ] that's come through in the

515
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,038
recent months that it's like, nah, this

516
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,639
is like some watered down cross of it.

517
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,960
We keep trying to get cuts through our

518
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
program and nothing is the real deal.

519
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
So, I've refused to smoke any of it

520
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,360
because I can just tell I don't want to

521
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,038
ruin that memory because that memory is

522
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,678
still there, but it's it's it'll still

523
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,919
be there because I smoked so much of the

524
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,840
I smoked so much of this stuff trying to

525
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,280
get the sour back because we had I had

526
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,359
to go back to my aunt and uncle get it

527
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,599
six times where I lost it and finally

528
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,279
they got rid of it. And so, it' been

529
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,879
several years and this guy Dave I've

530
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,440
told this story in my podcast a bunch,

531
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
but this guy Dave from Budilero came up

532
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,919
at Reagan on the River last year was

533
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
like, "Tell me what you think of it."

534
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,759
And it was the real deal sour. And so I

535
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,678
ended up getting a pound to smoke. Um,

536
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,279
and I've been smoking off it. You know,

537
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,720
I I still have a little bit left. In

538
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,000
fact, that's awesome. Yeah, I'll I'll

539
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,839
get you some of it. But it's the real

540
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,759
deal. And the thing is is like I thought

541
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,519
maybe my memory was lying to me about

542
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,359
how good it was or how, you know, that

543
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,119
all this stuff is maybe these are just

544
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,839
versions of it, but the thing is is like

545
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,759
when you remember it uh like I did

546
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,279
because I had it so for so long and I

547
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,839
enjoyed it so much when I was younger.

548
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,480
Once you get it again, it's like it's

549
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,240
unmistakable. And there was a point

550
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,919
where we only had one sour. There wasn't

551
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,440
all these different sour. There was one

552
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,919
sour and it was like it had it was fy,

553
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,798
but it was also sweet and there was like

554
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,880
a little bit of a lemon component to it

555
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,519
and and but it was very unique and its

556
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,760
own thing and no matter who grew it, it

557
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,000
was always like that. Now I think some

558
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,319
of the genetics probably have drifted,

559
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,400
you know what I mean? through uh

560
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,678
potential pathogen contamination, hop

561
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,600
plate and void or systemic bacteria even

562
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,919
stuff like that where I think it could

563
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,439
have changed the expression and so maybe

564
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,640
some people even have the right cut but

565
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
they just can't get it to express

566
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
properly. But Dave's had the same cut

567
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,640
forever and his express is exactly how I

568
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,559
remembered it. Yeah, that's one of those

569
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
ones that you know is clearly on the

570
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,558
comeback right now. There's a lot of

571
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,480
people breeding with it. I've yet to see

572
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,000
anything that I haven't seen a lot, but

573
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,919
the stuff I've seen hasn't I haven't

574
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,440
gotten super excited yet, but I am

575
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,200
excited for the comeback. I'm excited

576
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,880
for comebacks in general. Dude, the

577
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,720
green, what do you think about that? All

578
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,320
this purple weed and I feel like it's

579
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,079
time for the green to come back. We

580
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,639
embarked on what we referred to as

581
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,720
sativa revival like 5 years ago where we

582
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,559
started a breeding project and it wasn't

583
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,200
just specifically green, but I mean most

584
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,079
sativas, you know, tend to tend to lean

585
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,440
green. And so that led us down this path

586
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:02,079
of all this old school stuff, you know,

587
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
some of it nasty and, you know, yeah, I

588
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,918
remember this was never good and or I

589
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,519
it's not that it wasn't good, it's not

590
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,799
my preference, you know, some of these

591
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:14,558
hazes and, you know, but it's led us

592
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,319
down a path and um I love it. I mean,

593
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,038
look, dude, just cuz something the

594
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,558
funniest thing about purple weed is once

595
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,480
I learned, which I and I learned it

596
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,519
pretty early. Once I learned that purple

597
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,519
meant nothing to quality Yeah. it it was

598
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:32,158
in my head except I could not stop my

599
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:35,359
own preference. Mhm. In term because

600
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,320
it's so visually appealing like when you

601
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,479
look at a a really welldone purple bud

602
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,439
that's got that nice gradient. Not solid

603
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,440
purple. I don't like it when they're

604
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,840
solid purple. I like it when it's like

605
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,080
what I would say like 7030 or 8020 and

606
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,240
it's like got that nice hue. Yeah. Like

607
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,558
I think gelade has a really nice when

608
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,798
done really well has a really nice blend

609
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:59,519
of of green but but to this day you know

610
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,119
visually I still prefer purple even

611
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,839
though I know it means nothing to

612
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,399
quality right but in terms of what I

613
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:10,798
prefer to smoke right now it is greenw

614
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,960
weed all day long it's it's J1 any of a

615
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,599
lot of stuff from the Jack Carrera you

616
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,519
know whole family area there's a lot of

617
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,359
good jacks that's what people don't

618
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,960
understand is in California people hate

619
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,119
Jack hair and uh I got to say hair like

620
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,720
terror cuz they you know but uh it's so

621
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,519
funny because like in California I think

622
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,159
it's the least liked strain maybe on in

623
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,480
in the in the streets blue dream is

624
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,080
disliked but on the in wreck people love

625
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,679
blue dream blue dream is a number one

626
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:41,918
selling strain

627
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,679
in California I love blue dream too in

628
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,520
in its own in its own right blue is

629
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,880
extremely as as a grower and someone who

630
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,240
used to grow blue I loved growing

631
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,159
growing Blue Dream. It was It was the

632
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,720
best. It makes you feel so good. Yeah.

633
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,200
It makes you feel good as a grower. Yes.

634
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,360
As a grower, too. I can do this. I

635
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,960
crushed I crushed. Yeah. I mean, my

636
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,158
friends thought I was such a good grower

637
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,360
when I was growing Blue Dream and it was

638
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,640
like when it first came around and

639
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,558
everyone's like, "Dude, like thought I

640
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,159
was the best grower." And a lot of it

641
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,759
had to do with the genetics. My OG

642
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,760
didn't, you know, it was OG and it was

643
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,000
good, but I struggled with OG. I'd have

644
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,599
good harvest and bad harvest and every

645
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,159
single harvest didn't check the boxes

646
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,519
necess necessarily. But Blue Dream is

647
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,960
like every single one of them was good.

648
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,200
And sometimes it was a little more

649
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,279
sticky or a little bit, you know, little

650
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,720
bit brighter, but it it was loud. It

651
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,000
was, you know, when I used to grow it,

652
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,000
it was amazing. So, yeah. So, we're So,

653
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,480
I love bringing back old stuff. I love

654
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,839
that the green stuff's coming back

655
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,839
around. We, you know, we've been through

656
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,199
every OG that we can find. We finally

657
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,158
launched one that we thought was good.

658
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,759
It was Ghost OG. And um and and it's

659
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,039
pretty good. It's it's it's really good.

660
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,759
I'm really pleased with what we're

661
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:49,519
putting out, but it's still not that

662
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:52,240
that that original that memory. Yeah, I

663
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,639
think Blem's unruly OG. I think they do

664
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,400
a fantastic job. I've been wondering

665
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,280
that. I saw that nug. I was like, is

666
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,720
that really OG? That is the Florida

667
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,558
crippy. I actually showed Fletcher. I

668
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,919
was I was hanging out with at an event.

669
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,599
Fletcher was sitting at the table,

670
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,159
showed him. He He thought it was like

671
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,918
the Hawaiian skunk dog or the Maui skunk

672
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,679
dog. And I got it as the

673
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,240
crippy and uh it's definitely got the

674
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
nose burning gas and it definitely is

675
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,759
strong, but this washes and it grows

676
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,839
like a sativa. It's got narrow leaves

677
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,879
and really, you know, it stacks pretty

678
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:30,000
well, but it has really thin leaves and

679
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,840
uh you just don't see gas like this any

680
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,919
No, you don't. Um I miss it just like I

681
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,678
miss the sour diesel, but I do see some

682
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,799
pretty good OG from time to time. Like I

683
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,120
said, unrulies is pretty or blem unruly

684
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,480
is pretty good. Like the nose on it.

685
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,158
Sometimes their structure is a little

686
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,839
like, you know, the buds are a little

687
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,679
kind of weak like they look like

688
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,480
something might be wrong with the plant,

689
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,038
but the smell and the effect are and and

690
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,798
the and the flavor are what I pretty

691
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,879
close to what I remember. Brian from

692
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,480
Vital, he brings down some every once in

693
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
a while. He's got some freaking

694
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,679
phenomenal OG and I don't share it with

695
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,759
anybody. That's when you know it's good

696
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,600
is when I like keep it to myself. We get

697
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,599
some batches of the dirt Skittles that's

698
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,439
grown, soil grown Skittles. Oh, nice.

699
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,278
And I just keep that mostly for myself.

700
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
Like I'll get small amounts. I give it a

701
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,839
couple friends and then I just make sure

702
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,200
to pile it away. And I I just really

703
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,798
enjoy certain things. And Skittles is

704
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,759
one of those ones I still love smoking

705
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,319
Skittles. Um I I smoke everything, but

706
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,839
you know, Skittles I go back to. Uh and

707
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,960
I don't think candy's going away. I

708
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,038
don't think it's going away anytime

709
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,000
soon. People, it's just it's too easy

710
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,359
for people to smoke candy. Uh, you know,

711
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,640
people that aren't even connoisseurs,

712
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,399
it's like they taste and then they're

713
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,799
like, "Oh, tastes like something

714
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,278
familiar." Yeah. I do love the taste of

715
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,158
good green weed, though. Like I I miss

716
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,960
that part of it the most, I think. Yeah.

717
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,559
I mean, I'd say the J1 and and we just

718
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,278
recently brought it back and started

719
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,678
doing some breeding with it, but it's

720
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:58,798
probably in my top three strains of all

721
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,720
time, but also for sure my top my top

722
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,400
green weed. It's just it just makes me

723
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,679
feel happy, you know, and that at the

724
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,200
end of the day, like, you know, I'm

725
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,360
older now. I'm I'm got a lot of

726
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,840
responsibility. I've got three kids. I'm

727
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:15,038
busy. And I need something that can give

728
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:17,439
me like I need something that's additive

729
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,599
on top of all the other [ __ ] you know,

730
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,600
where even if I think I got a day on the

731
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,918
couch or a day just chilling by the pool

732
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,839
and something comes up, I'm like, I'm

733
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,520
there. And like the a lot of the green

734
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,199
strains are that for me right now.

735
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,000
That's why we've done so much with with

736
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:37,200
the sativas um the tropical Z we did

737
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:41,200
which is a uh Tom Hill Haze um by GDP

738
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,360
that cross then crossed by um Zeno and

739
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,440
it's just real light and fun and

740
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:50,558
flavorful and like no stress, no anxiety

741
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,679
and no nap time and I don't need more

742
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,000
than one burrito, right? you know, I'm

743
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,159
really enjoying that like that that

744
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
place right now. And that most purple

745
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,880
weed doesn't doesn't afford me that I

746
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,798
can't smoke anything purple on a Sunday

747
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,559
morning, you know, before I embark on

748
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,200
whatever we're doing as a family that

749
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,119
day. Um, unless I can convince them it's

750
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,919
movie day all day, you know, it's like

751
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:16,719
it's rainy day outside. I got ZDP coming

752
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,720
down that we got ZDP. ZDP. It's exactly

753
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,640
what you think when you hear ZDP. It's

754
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,679
like exact because it's it leans heavy

755
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,679
on the granddaddy and then it has a

756
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,679
candy finish to it, but it's very much

757
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,080
like nostalgic. I I'm bringing back some

758
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,600
nostalgic stuff like I got a dream

759
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,119
candy. We're calling it that's the

760
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,480
working name of it right now is Dream

761
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,479
Candy, but someone else has the name

762
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,000
Dream Candy. So have to call it Loud

763
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,120
Dream Candy. But uh it's it's a double

764
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,400
LCG which is a runt S1 and then we put

765
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,759
that with the Blue Dream. And the thing

766
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,480
is with Blue Dream, that's another

767
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,240
breeder that's very stable in the sense

768
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,919
that there's only like four phenotypes

769
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,359
that really expresses an S1 and then you

770
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,600
put that with something like Lemon

771
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,119
Cherry and you're going to get uh some

772
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,439
stable expressions in there and you're

773
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,639
going to get the real blue dream with a

774
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,120
little bit of candy. And that's what we

775
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,640
we we found three that we really liked

776
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,439
that lean towards different things, but

777
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,159
I really like the old school with just a

778
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,320
little bit hint of candy. So, so I want

779
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,919
to hear more about the ZDP though. How

780
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,079
have you grown it already? We've grown

781
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,159
it. We've grown. How does

782
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:22,000
that could something yield lower than

783
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,399
Skittles? Like, yes, you can cross it

784
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,759
with GDP. You can cross it with GDP and

785
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,439
you're going to get a low yield and

786
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,679
you're going to get a slow veg. Right.

787
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,159
So, it's it's everything that growers

788
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,600
hate, but everything that smokers love.

789
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,360
Right. Right. And I think this one

790
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,519
that's where it's trending right now.

791
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,959
Find that pocket. Oh, really? It might

792
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,158
wash better. It'll wash better than

793
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,759
Skittles. I guarantee you that cuz

794
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,039
Skittles is washing like one and a half

795
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,119
to 2%. So if it and I love I love rosin

796
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,640
too. So I still I I do more of the rosin

797
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,678
in the morning. Like I'll do dabs in the

798
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,880
morning before I go to the gym. Uh but I

799
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,640
don't dab throughout the day because it

800
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,080
makes me super tired. But if I do one

801
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,159
good one in the morning before I go to

802
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,119
the gym, I'm not smelling like Juan over

803
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,960
at UFC gym that, you know, he comes in

804
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,359
wreaking of his joints, you know, and I

805
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,200
I'm I'm I'm high, but I just I I take

806
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:12,558
the nice little dab. Yeah. I've the

807
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,440
reason I haven't gotten too much into

808
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,519
into dabbing is I don't know, call me

809
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,000
lazy, call me whatever, but I just don't

810
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,839
like keeping the rig all clean. Like

811
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,240
I've done it and it's like gets all

812
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,959
gross and and I'm just not into it. But

813
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,839
someone recently gifted me the um the

814
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,600
puff code like the the pen looking thing

815
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,678
where you flip and that thing has been

816
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,599
fantastic for me. Yeah, I got a focus I

817
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,000
[ __ ] love. I got a focus view one for

818
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,599
you today, too. So they're competitors,

819
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,359
but I like both brands for their own

820
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,119
things. Sam is a great guy. He's also a

821
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,959
good friend of mine. We do events, but

822
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,519
I'll give you some rosin. So I I

823
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,759
recently got heavy into understanding

824
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,158
rosin for breeding purposes, right? So

825
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,079
like I just I don't want to be an expert

826
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,440
in making it, but I really need to

827
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,158
understand it more. The different

828
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,840
microns, which ones to combine. Um and

829
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
then also when I'm breeding, what are we

830
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,879
really breeding for? What kind of heads

831
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,038
are we breeding for? All these different

832
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,679
things. And so I took a deep dive into

833
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,278
it. Uh, I work with SF Canana and so

834
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,720
they've been working on some rosin

835
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,200
projects with some of their stuff and

836
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,798
we're we're going to be producing some

837
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,480
washers and I felt like I had to educate

838
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,798
myself so I started smoking a lot more

839
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,798
rosin. Also hash holes and it brings

840
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,038
back to like I like hash holes. Yeah.

841
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,398
And it really brings back to like that

842
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,919
umbrella model where you have to have a

843
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,759
bunch of different product SKs anymore.

844
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,159
You can't just settle on flour. Now I'm

845
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,679
like okay well I'm not doing the

846
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,840
cultivating but with my cultivation

847
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,919
partners I want to be able to bring

848
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,839
flour. We want to bring joints. We want

849
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,799
to bring hand rolls and pre-rolls.

850
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,720
Something that's economical. Uh rosin,

851
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,558
hash holes. I think hash holes is a

852
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,120
no-brainer. And people love hash holes

853
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:49,038
for the turpps. So, but it's not the

854
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,398
most economical way to smoke rosin

855
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,839
because it's like I put a half gram in

856
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,599
there and it takes me a while to smoke a

857
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,278
half gram of rosin, but I can smoke a

858
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,038
joint with a half gram of rosin in the

859
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,558
evening.

860
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,158
That's a power joint, right? That's a

861
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,519
power joint. Yeah. But you know, and the

862
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,880
funny thing is, so I want to be able to

863
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,879
roll them because I want to teach people

864
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,559
how to my guys how to roll them so I can

865
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,000
QC everything. And so I wanted to learn

866
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,158
how to roll hash holes properly. And

867
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,798
there's a huge learning curve to that.

868
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,440
Yeah, I haven't tried. I I should say I

869
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,359
have tried. I have not rolled them very

870
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,399
well, very successful. I've actually

871
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,319
done them in blunts. I I really enjoy

872
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,439
blunts. Like blunts is probably my

873
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,439
preferred method. Um although it's

874
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,759
started to wear on the throat a little

875
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,000
bit. Yeah. And so and because of the

876
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,158
volume we're we're asked to smoke on a

877
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,159
regular basis because of our breeding

878
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,519
program, the joints are a lot easier.

879
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,840
Yeah. Um but I can't roll like Yeah.

880
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,480
Like these like these these beautiful I

881
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,199
can't do that. So I had my wife take a

882
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,159
class from from one of the h from one of

883
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,319
the hand rollers up in Sacramento. Not a

884
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,519
class. I was like which one of is it? It

885
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,519
was Christian from um Sacramento. He he

886
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,038
he taught her and I was just like cuz he

887
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,558
rolls some of our stuff for some of our

888
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,960
events sometimes. I'm like, "Hey, can

889
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,278
you just sit with her?" And uh and teach

890
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,600
her cuz she likes doing it. She's good

891
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,359
really good with her hands and and so

892
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,278
she does them when she's when she's

893
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,798
feeling up to it. So I'm just like I've

894
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,480
sort of backed away from it. I'm like

895
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,480
I'll let you do these. I I got a lot of

896
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,159
other [ __ ] I got to do. Totally. Well,

897
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,360
yeah. And I feel like Yeah. It's one of

898
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,440
those things. It's there's a pretty big

899
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,599
learning curve to all of it. And but

900
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,000
joints is it's the best way for feno

901
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,839
hunting to actually test your work,

902
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,278
right? I feel like if you want to put

903
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,639
the even playing field out there, you

904
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,079
can't just give people a bag of weed

905
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,000
anymore. You have to give them I didn't

906
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,359
realize that. That was a mistake. Cuz

907
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,880
then people take it put it, you know

908
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,240
what I mean? Are you smoking bongs with

909
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,240
it? What are you doing? You know, and

910
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,839
it's like if you give them a joint,

911
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,919
you're going to give them the same size

912
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,278
joint. It's gonna burn pretty much the

913
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,120
same depending on how they're dragging

914
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,200
it of course, but like they're going to

915
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,199
get a similar experience than if

916
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,880
somebody's taking a bong hit or

917
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,319
someone's rolling their own pinner

918
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,080
joint, you know? It's like cuz I feel

919
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,558
like there's the perfect, you know, I

920
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,000
like the 10 mm organ tips right now.

921
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,200
That's what I'm pretty stuck on with the

922
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,960
elements paper. And I I like a tight

923
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,159
grind so that you get, you know, it's

924
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,679
like it's one of those ones where it

925
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,399
checks the box, too, where you get that

926
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,600
nice white ash. And the ash has a lot to

927
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,518
do with how you roll it. people don't

928
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,839
understand that it's not just how you I

929
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,000
mean flushing of course you know I think

930
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,240
flushing is super important these days

931
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,759
but also how you roll it uh how tight it

932
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,278
is all those things and then the grind

933
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,759
on it like if you're going to roll a

934
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,200
blunt you want a really like a coarse

935
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,879
grind whereas if you want to roll a

936
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
joint like that and you want it to burn

937
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,760
perfect you're going to want a fine

938
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,599
grind yeah so you know Ted was really

939
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,359
beating his drum he's like we got to we

940
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,918
got to focus on the white ash we got to

941
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,359
focus on it to the R&amp;D department they

942
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,200
were like nah we're not sure we're

943
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,759
bought in that this is actually a thing.

944
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,679
And so they did a deep dive, you know,

945
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,839
interviewing people, talk, you know, we

946
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,919
went so far, we bought a smoke machine

947
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,319
because we couldn't smoke or we didn't

948
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,480
buy one. We made one this smoke machine.

949
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,960
So it pulses and it couldn't smoke I

950
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,360
think six or seven joints at once and it

951
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,440
like it has a hood on it so it pulses

952
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,879
and everyone laughs. Oh, I want to I'll

953
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,120
do it. You don't have to have that. Like

954
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,559
you have no idea. Anyone who said they

955
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,799
will do it can't keep up with the

956
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,719
volumet. end up quitting or they can't

957
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,440
give notes, they just can't keep up with

958
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:18,078
the program whatsoever. So, we did that

959
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,639
um just to be able to test that the ash

960
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,480
of stuff to to do it at volume cuz we're

961
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,679
looking at outliers of white ash, you

962
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,519
know, assuming that it's rolled

963
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,679
correctly. But in that whole process,

964
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,398
they realize it has to do with the roll,

965
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,559
the grind, the moisture percentage, the

966
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,039
paper that you're using, how the thing

967
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,878
was lit, you know, what what what did

968
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,639
you use torch? Did you use lighter?

969
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,519
Like, and there's all these things, come

970
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,000
to find out also that you can do to get

971
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,358
that really beautiful Instagram video.

972
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You know, there's things you can

973
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,759
specifically do to get the white ash

974
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,440
looking a specific way. They'll hit it

975
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,520
with the torch afterwards just to I

976
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,599
mean, I see all kinds of stuff. And I

977
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,519
don't I mean, I've been smoking weed for

978
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,200
30 years, and we didn't really talk

979
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,559
about ash very much. I mean, black ash,

980
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,199
it was kind of weird back in the day. I

981
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,440
never thought black ash was good, but I

982
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,078
didn't see cigarette white ash or cigar

983
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,280
white ash until maybe four or five years

984
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,560
ago at the earliest. And now it's like a

985
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,760
thing where it's like, oh, this is a box

986
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,480
that has to be checked. And I'm not 100%

987
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,000
sold on all of it. I do understand that

988
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,599
it it's another one of those things,

989
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,280
especially if it's flushed correctly.

990
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,200
And you talk you talk about how it drips

991
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,200
and you know the the oil ring on there.

992
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,879
I think sure that's great, but not

993
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,399
everything has the same oil ring. It's

994
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,880
it's definitely specific to different

995
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
genetics. Um, but you know, I've been

996
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,160
taking deep dives in all these

997
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,679
directions to making sure we're ahead of

998
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,679
the curve with all this stuff, too. It's

999
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,399
like I feel like that stuff's important.

1000
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah, we So, we got the smoke machine

1001
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,680
and then they figured out all the

1002
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,358
components. They figured, you know, they

1003
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,279
homogenized, make sure everything that

1004
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,960
we were rolling. We figured out the way

1005
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,880
that most people were considered, you

1006
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,480
know, it's in a joint like that, a

1007
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,760
certain grind, certain moisture

1008
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,119
percentage. And then we measure the ash

1009
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,440
color to see if there's genetic

1010
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,960
outliers, right? And so we were

1011
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,679
collecting the ash and then putting them

1012
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,679
in this thing that measures different

1013
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,679
tones of of white all the way up to

1014
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:14,159
black. And so we're actually able to s

1015
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:16,879
assign an exact objective score. Wow.

1016
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:19,920
Using, you know, this this this the

1017
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,039
scale of of white is white versus black

1018
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,838
is black and everything in between. You

1019
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,838
guys notice a difference in what do you

1020
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:28,000
mean in like equality? it. I mean, with

1021
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:30,400
a white ash, if it's whiter ash, does it

1022
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,559
translate into a better quality product

1023
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,240
as far as flavor or

1024
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:40,239
So flavor is the priority and not always

1025
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,719
when it tastes really good does it burn

1026
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:46,159
the whitest. Sure. But never when it

1027
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:49,039
burns really white does it taste bad, if

1028
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:53,358
that makes sense. So that the white ash

1029
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:55,838
only helps it, but it is not a a a a

1030
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:59,440
mandatory qualifier. Um it doesn't have

1031
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:01,920
to burn crazy white to to meet to check

1032
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,639
all the other boxes. And we do all sorts

1033
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,559
of blind trials and you know, so we've

1034
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,519
been able to figure out like white ash

1035
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,320
is a plus. It's an it's additive, but

1036
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,559
something can pass without having the

1037
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,599
whitest of ash. And it's a huge genetic

1038
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,119
component. Like RS11 as an example, and

1039
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,400
it's one of the reasons it's bred with

1040
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,000
so much. It just burns white, like crazy

1041
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,240
white. You breed with it, it helps it.

1042
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,159
Um and and then but the other thing

1043
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:33,919
we've noticed is flower structure plays

1044
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:36,000
a big role. So we have four flowering

1045
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,240
facilities, three in California and then

1046
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,480
one in Arizona.

1047
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:43,118
And we're we started noticing there was

1048
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,760
there was you know the flower from two

1049
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,680
of the facilities was was burning whiter

1050
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,920
than the others just consistently time

1051
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,000
and time again. And then we were really

1052
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,000
trying to because we're using same SOPs,

1053
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,079
same everything. There should be no

1054
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,679
difference. We started noticing minor

1055
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,000
differences in the flower structure and

1056
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,000
the brack size. And we noticed that the

1057
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,358
smaller the brack the more of the bracks

1058
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:10,000
there are Yeah. and the the smaller they

1059
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:13,039
were um the better it burned. Um so our

1060
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,358
our our flagship facility in in in

1061
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,119
Northern California in Sacramento, which

1062
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,679
has always put out like the best stuff,

1063
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,599
doesn't have the whitest burning stuff,

1064
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,919
but the flower structure is different.

1065
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,559
Um the weed also gets more purple at

1066
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,559
that facility. It's actually our oldest

1067
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,920
of the modern facilities, so there's

1068
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,920
some things that are a little different

1069
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,079
at this one. Yeah. So, it gets more

1070
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,240
purple than the other facility. Um, I've

1071
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,640
also heard people say like the darker

1072
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,919
the like when it's really purple, um,

1073
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:45,838
sometimes it get ash. Yeah, I've noticed

1074
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,400
that. So, it's all just exciting. Like,

1075
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,880
we try to not come to any hard and fast

1076
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,800
conclusions. Like a lot of pe folks in

1077
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,240
the industry like just come down hard

1078
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
and it's just like this is because of

1079
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,559
this. wine is like and the reality is

1080
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,920
like there's very few scientists in this

1081
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,400
space and it's not to knock any of the

1082
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,280
work anyone's done like we've all come a

1083
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,480
long way with very little against all

1084
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,920
against a lot of odds right um but I

1085
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,838
think one of the most important things

1086
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,599
is we all remain you know open-minded

1087
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,000
that there's going to be information

1088
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,960
that comes along that is counter to what

1089
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,800
you've believed and preached and taught

1090
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,199
for sometimes decades like blurals you

1091
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,280
the the purple LEDs, they were so bad.

1092
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,719
And and this is an example of just one

1093
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,079
of the many things that I've seen over

1094
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,118
the years where I'm like, I'm never

1095
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,160
using LEDs cuz these blurals, it's good

1096
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,838
though, right? Dude, got that that nose

1097
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,358
burning, you know? It's nostalgic from

1098
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,440
the 90s, right? I feel like that's what

1099
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,759
I love about it. But I've seen so many

1100
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,760
things over the years where I'm like, u

1101
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,040
flowers suck. Now I breed autoflowers,

1102
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,680
right? I've been breeding autoflowers

1103
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,358
for the last seven years. About Yeah,

1104
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,719
about seven years now. I said

1105
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,319
autoflowers suck. I'd never work with

1106
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,639
them. LEDs, I'm never going to use them.

1107
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,400
I use LEDs now. Under canopies I was

1108
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:04,239
excited about and now I I guess under

1109
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,079
canopies originally Tim was Bobby Bags

1110
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,838
worked with you and was you guys were

1111
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,119
doing under canopies at your facility a

1112
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,639
long time ago. Yeah. So Ian um Ian

1113
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,400
Justice who's our our head of

1114
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,679
cultivation and R&amp;D, he came from

1115
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,519
Driscoll's background in controlled

1116
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,519
plant agriculture

1117
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,800
um or I forget what the term is. It's

1118
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,639
not controlled plant, but something like

1119
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,359
that. I went to school for growing

1120
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:30,159
plants indoors. Long story short, and

1121
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,838
controlled environment agriculture, CA,

1122
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:33,598
I think that's what it is. Uh, went to

1123
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,880
school for that. Done a ton of work on

1124
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,000
genetics. Did a lot of work with

1125
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,320
Driscolls. Um, did proprietary created a

1126
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,559
proprietary technique for growing uh

1127
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,079
blueberries in in pots like no one had

1128
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,679
ever done it before. Said it couldn't be

1129
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,440
said it couldn't be done. He did it

1130
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,960
increased yield. So, he's got a really

1131
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,559
interesting background. And in his first

1132
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,159
few weeks, he's looking at the plant,

1133
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,799
you know, one of our purple strains, and

1134
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,279
it's like top two/3s is purple, bottom

1135
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,200
third is green. What's going on? This is

1136
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
not this is not right. Like, this

1137
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,318
shouldn't look like this. Yeah. And he

1138
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:09,199
had some LEDs uh from a project. They

1139
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:11,679
were GE LEDs that he had from a project

1140
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,358
from from sidelighting on blackberry

1141
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,440
plants because I guess they go grow

1142
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,920
blackberries really tall. Oh, wow. And

1143
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,440
and so they they had experimented with

1144
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,280
sidelighting. I guess it wasn't worth

1145
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,679
the, you know, the output that it

1146
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,519
additional output in blackberry. So, he

1147
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,358
just like had them in his garage and he

1148
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,559
brought them in, figured rigged them up

1149
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:34,239
and put them under our plants and first

1150
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:37,279
round was like 25% yield increase. Wow.

1151
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,639
And it was like what? And you know,

1152
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,000
everyone's like, "Oh, the numbers." They

1153
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,039
were like looking back at the numbers.

1154
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,318
We didn't have as good as data

1155
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,039
collection back then. We're like, "Is

1156
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,039
this real?" Kept running them and it was

1157
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,519
like, "Holy shit." You know, it's more

1158
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,279
purple. Yeah. And it was more purple. So

1159
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,119
like the buds at the bottom, some of the

1160
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,119
buds closest to the light were some of

1161
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,599
the best buds where that [ __ ] would have

1162
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,599
made it into trim or into pre-rolls

1163
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,599
maybe, you know. Yeah. Or just gotten

1164
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,800
rid of, you know, stripping that canopy.

1165
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,240
I mean, I believed in stripping the

1166
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,000
undercarriage until I met until I met

1167
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,919
Tim. Until Faven, you know, he gave us

1168
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,920
some favins. And I'm a believer. Not

1169
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,680
only just a believer, but I I I think

1170
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,000
through trials, we test everything here.

1171
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,679
We're R&amp;D facility, so it's always okay.

1172
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,159
Well, let's use a control and then test

1173
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,679
this against the control. And uh light

1174
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,239
lifts is another one. It's like I like

1175
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,838
light lifts because you can basically uh

1176
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,358
tune your lights down. You you're not

1177
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,279
running them as as hot. So, you're

1178
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,318
basically not using as much electricity.

1179
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,319
You can bring them right down on the

1180
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,400
plants and uh with the lights we're

1181
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,159
using, it works great. So, and then

1182
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,358
combined with the favins, now we're

1183
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:41,759
saving a bunch of money. Yeah. Um it it

1184
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,838
was a big difference, a big change. You

1185
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,440
know, I think Tim or Bobby Bags, he was

1186
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,199
working for us during that time and then

1187
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,880
went off. I mean, we have no interest in

1188
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,559
being in the light business. We It's

1189
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,480
hard enough doing what we're trying to

1190
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,838
do and across. He is killing it. Yeah,

1191
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,000
we're stoked for him. We're happy for

1192
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,759
them. Me and Kevin go way back. Like

1193
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,400
Kevin's such a good dude. He's always

1194
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,640
been solid. Like, you know, that whole

1195
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,639
hydroponics world was so weird for a

1196
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,239
while. It was just like you didn't even

1197
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,519
you know you kind of like had to have

1198
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,519
it's the weirdest thing where you walk

1199
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,920
into a retail store and you have to have

1200
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,920
trust with someone like a certain level

1201
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,358
so you could talk openly right and like

1202
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,760
some of the stores you couldn't build

1203
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,920
that and so you really had to like the

1204
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,560
guy and trust the guy and like start

1205
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,280
talking talking about tomatoes. Yeah.

1206
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,000
It's like [ __ ] stop. I hated that [ __ ]

1207
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,519
It was like so ridiculous. And so I I

1208
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,119
would really choose who I'd work with.

1209
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,358
I'm like, "Okay, I don't expect you to

1210
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,440
talk like that in the first few

1211
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,679
transactions, but dude, I've been coming

1212
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,119
here for 6 months. Like, can we have an

1213
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,799
open conversation? There's no one in the

1214
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,079
store right now. Let's talk business."

1215
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,480
And some of them wouldn't do that, and

1216
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,640
it was annoying. Kevin was just [ __ ]

1217
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,838
he was just And I forget his partner,

1218
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,440
but Kevin had a partner um that ended up

1219
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,279
getting locked up and doing some time,

1220
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,720
but we first dealt with his partner, and

1221
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,960
that was like the coolest dude I had

1222
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,118
ever dealt with. I'm so bummed I forget

1223
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,720
his name. dude is such an OG, but he

1224
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,800
went away for like four years on some

1225
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,559
federal charge. But that dude was so

1226
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,400
[ __ ] cool. But then I got to meet

1227
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,920
Kevin because that guy went away and

1228
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,559
Kevin had been running something else

1229
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,079
and then came and yeah, Kevin was just

1230
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,920
is, you know, we don't really deal with

1231
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,839
hydro stores anymore. We're like a lot

1232
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,720
of direct to supplier type

1233
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:23,679
relationships, but he is he's the OG.

1234
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,078
He's the goat of of the hydro stores in

1235
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,078
Sacramento for sure. Yeah. Yeah, it's

1236
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,240
funny the OGs that are still around is

1237
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,079
like it's pretty amazing that industry

1238
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,519
has completely changed too, you know,

1239
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,960
with cultivation facilities coming

1240
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,358
online because originally they were

1241
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,760
dealing with people that had garages

1242
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,440
uh maybe 8 10 lights at the most and

1243
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,520
then it turned into 50 lights and then

1244
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,440
50 lights turned into a thousand lights.

1245
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,440
Yeah. Real quick. But yeah, and then

1246
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,838
that whole infrastructure changed and

1247
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,599
then you know you're and then prices

1248
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,279
plummeted. So you're like trying to

1249
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,440
competing with the internet, you know,

1250
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,200
too. It's like wild. And then though and

1251
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,119
then the suppliers are coming direct to

1252
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,199
us. They started marketing direct to us

1253
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,280
or not even marketing just straight up,

1254
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,199
you know, cold calling like, "Hey, like

1255
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,200
there's no, you know, buy in bulk, buy

1256
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,279
our stuff, ship you a pallet, try this

1257
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,159
out." Y Yeah. And then Ian had all these

1258
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,720
contacts. Oh, so so anyways, we worked

1259
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:19,039
uh with GE over the years and GE was not

1260
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,719
interested in targeting the cannabis

1261
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,039
community. They're like, "They don't

1262
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,598
pay. they they're a pain in the ass to

1263
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,159
deal with, you know, and we're not

1264
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,760
interested. But Ian, because of who he

1265
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,759
was and the language he could speak,

1266
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,160
they were willing to talk to him. So, we

1267
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,200
worked with GE over the years and we're

1268
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,838
on iteration five that they since sold

1269
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,838
the that component of their company to

1270
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,440
some other, right, some other lighting

1271
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,960
company who we have no relationship with

1272
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,480
and now we're looking at all the under

1273
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,760
canopies that have come up since and

1274
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,400
we're going to, you know, see which ones

1275
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,720
we want to move to. But you know it was

1276
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,559
him and the l you know who he was that

1277
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,639
allowed us to create that relationship

1278
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,039
with GE at the time and go through

1279
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,159
different iterations different diodes

1280
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:05,358
you know spacing and and spectrums and

1281
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,519
then created that and um yeah they've

1282
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,400
been great for us and it's been I mean

1283
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:12,358
it's the the most recent I mean I don't

1284
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,838
know what's come to the hydro I I guess

1285
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:17,838
like the the whole Aoya like the the

1286
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,759
monitoring that's probably even though

1287
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,838
that's been around for I think a long

1288
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,520
time. It's it's now if you don't have

1289
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,000
that it's like what are you doing you

1290
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:29,119
know environmental control like that

1291
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,719
crop steering. So I think aside from um

1292
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,640
that I think that you know the under

1293
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,639
canopy lighting was the biggest

1294
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,799
revolution to happen to indoor cannabis

1295
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,239
farming meaning in recent years. I mean

1296
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,160
before those two it was what

1297
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:42,039
double-ended bulbs and you know

1298
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:46,318
seriously it was which was like

1299
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:49,039
2012 2013 came online before. Oh my god,

1300
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,358
I forgot about EPAPS. It's crazy that

1301
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,440
certain names of products bring on a

1302
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,358
nostalgic feel. Totally. I'm like, it's

1303
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,838
just thinking about that time and that

1304
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:00,480
excitement level like we're going to

1305
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:02,400
make so much more money and then totally

1306
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,639
you did, but it was also hard and there

1307
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,119
was this whole learning curve and and

1308
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,879
you know, we used to run ducted hoods

1309
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,519
and now we're running, you know, bear

1310
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,920
bulb and we had to re readjust all our

1311
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,119
calcs on on everything. It was crazy.

1312
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,318
And most people that were moving forward

1313
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,760
from a long time ago, they didn't have

1314
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,599
enough dehumidification. We didn't

1315
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,319
calculate that correctly. We didn't know

1316
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,519
any better. Um, but yeah, and I think a

1317
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,599
lot of people still don't have enough

1318
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,599
dew, you know, and that that's one of

1319
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,760
the things that happened. So Ian came in

1320
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,760
and we we introduced, you know, we did

1321
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,000
small trials, so the yield increase was

1322
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,079
a percentage of the room or percentage

1323
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,920
of the canopy, right? And then when we

1324
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,560
did whole rooms, it was like the whole

1325
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,480
thing broke. And we're like, okay, when

1326
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,838
you all of a sudden increase yield by

1327
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,679
between 20 and 30%. Yeah. That's a whole

1328
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,318
lot of transpiration that wasn't

1329
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,960
happening before. And now all your calcs

1330
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,880
are gone out the window. And you got to

1331
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,800
luckily we had extra power, but a lot of

1332
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,079
people just, you know, their rooms every

1333
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,640
they put in every light they could with

1334
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,839
their power service and an extra, you

1335
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:10,719
know, 705 or whatever the the the

1336
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,400
dehuses are. That's not there's no room

1337
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:14,480
for that. you got to cut lights and

1338
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,519
people don't want to cut lights and so

1339
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,039
they're growing and they sacrifice

1340
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,400
quality betritis and they deal with PM

1341
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,159
and other other issues like that and

1342
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,318
then they just they're in the cycle of

1343
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,480
death you know and they they can't seem

1344
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,960
to get out of it and no one wants to the

1345
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,800
owner doesn't want to hear you know that

1346
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,079
they got to cut lights out and it

1347
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,440
doesn't believe the grower doesn't think

1348
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,599
the grower is doing a good job or

1349
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,318
whatever the system is and they just

1350
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,559
they just circle down the drain. Well,

1351
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,800
it's like once you get betritis or some

1352
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,800
of these fungal pathogens in your air

1353
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,480
systems, it's like then you almost have

1354
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,160
to completely replace your air system.

1355
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,159
You can scrub to a degree. You can use

1356
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,159
UV. There's there's a there's ways you

1357
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:55,118
can treat it, but man, if your drying

1358
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,159
room has uh betritis circulating in it,

1359
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,358
it's going to you're going to have

1360
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,799
problems and it's going to be on the

1361
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,799
surface of the plant. It's it's a little

1362
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,640
bit different, but like it won't affect

1363
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,079
you. Sometimes it's a couple weeks after

1364
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,759
you put it in the bag, you have

1365
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,318
problems. Yeah. I've seen a little bit

1366
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,400
of that going on. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We've

1367
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:14,039
we've seen it all. In fact, on on the

1368
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:18,318
topic of of pathogens, you know, we're

1369
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:21,679
dealing with aspiggilis right now. And

1370
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:24,719
that sucks. It does because it's also

1371
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,558
not harmful at the, you know, at just

1372
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,159
any just the presence of it isn't

1373
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,160
necessarily harmful. It's everywhere.

1374
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:31,598
It's everywhere. Literally, it's it's in

1375
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,519
this room right now. I guarantee it.

1376
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,240
It's on us. It's I heard it's in your

1377
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:39,599
nose. It's in baby food. like it's

1378
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,159
[ __ ] everywhere and it's a non it's a

1379
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,640
tech detect or non-detect test in

1380
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:48,078
California which is just ridiculous. In

1381
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:50,719
in Arizona we you have the option on

1382
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,800
your testing to choose for I think it's

1383
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:56,719
the presence of aspiggillis or the

1384
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,559
presence of the mico myiotoxin or

1385
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,838
whatever that it creates right which it

1386
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,160
rarely turns into. We've had we're like

1387
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,599
at

1388
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:08,639
0.01% fail rate over the years in

1389
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,760
Arizona and we're at like you know five

1390
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,920
six% in California. Same weed, same

1391
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,000
yield, same everything. And no one's

1392
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,119
dying. No one has gotten sick. No one's

1393
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,039
reported anything in in Arizona. Um in

1394
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,960
other states it's total yeast and mold

1395
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:26,079
and those are at different levels. But

1396
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,760
it's a arguably a much better

1397
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,519
measurement, right? Because total yeast

1398
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,880
and mold can be a bunch of things. I

1399
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,960
don't even pretend to know if that's

1400
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,280
relevant. Yeah, but what I do know, what

1401
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,960
we're dealing with in California is not

1402
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,000
it's not practical. It doesn't make

1403
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,920
sense. And not only are we dealing with

1404
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,559
it, like we don't think that we have an

1405
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:50,079
outsized amount of aspergillis fails, we

1406
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,559
have become the target of of battling

1407
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,760
between labs. We were working with one

1408
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,280
lab and then we pulled our business

1409
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,280
because they weren't giving us, you

1410
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,880
know, their results started to vary

1411
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,319
significantly from where they were and

1412
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,519
we're like, "This doesn't make sense.

1413
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:05,759
Either something's wrong in your

1414
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,519
protocol or we don't know what's going

1415
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,520
on, but it doesn't work for our business

1416
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,199
anymore." So, we went to another lab and

1417
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,358
we told them the reason why. Well, they

1418
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,279
worked with some other labs who are also

1419
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,358
kind of on that end of the stick where

1420
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,960
they they're holding up some high and

1421
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:20,400
mighty posture of they're, you know,

1422
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,838
they're doing things one way and these

1423
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,920
other labs aren't doing the right way

1424
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,440
and they're all on this this war path

1425
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,960
attacking the other labs. It's the

1426
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,480
worst, you know, cuz there are haters

1427
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,000
out there and they are just looking to

1428
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,159
come after you and looking to come after

1429
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
me and everybody else and it's like it's

1430
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,279
so crazy that you can do that. And the

1431
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,880
thing is is of course there's going to

1432
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,119
be variance. thing is is you're testing

1433
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,559
like if you have a five pound bin and

1434
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,160
you're taking a random sample out of

1435
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,000
there, you don't know if that was from

1436
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,039
the top, the bottom where it was. You

1437
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,880
know what I mean? Even if you

1438
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,800
homogenized a bunch of it, which would

1439
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,039
give you a better result, it's not going

1440
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,280
to be 100% accurate. So, so they turned

1441
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,279
us in and then it resulted in the dcc

1442
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,559
going and pulling stuff off shelves.

1443
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,800
Like, they're pulling stuff off shelves

1444
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,960
that's been in market for 3 months. Like

1445
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,039
it sucks that unfortunately our product

1446
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,280
sometimes sits in market for 3 months

1447
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:06,960
like what is the environment that that

1448
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,359
store what's the temperature of their

1449
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,119
storage like did their AC go out did you

1450
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,039
know did it was it during rainy season

1451
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,599
and they I mean it shouldn't penetrate

1452
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:18,159
right but you never know what conditions

1453
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,920
are there and it's like and not to

1454
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:25,358
mention it passed DC it passed you know

1455
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,720
COA and it's in market well now they're

1456
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:30,719
going on a a witch hunt and they're just

1457
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,318
they're coming they're pulling samples

1458
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,959
and then they come back and pull samples

1459
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,800
from the same batches again. We're

1460
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,480
getting recalls right now from samples

1461
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,920
that were p pulled in January and

1462
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,838
they're just issuing a recall right now.

1463
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,240
It's like if you're truly after the

1464
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:47,679
health and wellness of the consumer

1465
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,358
base. Why did it take you 3 months to

1466
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,118
from the time you pulled the sample to

1467
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:52,880
the time you What is your testing

1468
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,880
protocol? Guess what? What is your

1469
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,039
testing protocol? They were they were

1470
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,000
given 15 million in the budget to build

1471
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,759
a lab. Six years, no lab. There's no dcc

1472
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,358
lab. We don't know which lab they're

1473
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,880
testing with. Are they testing with one

1474
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,719
of our competitors? That seems to be a

1475
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,640
conflict of interest. Totally. Uh are

1476
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,239
they, you know, meaning a one of the

1477
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,759
competing labs. It's a competitor,

1478
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,118
right? Is that that's a conflict of

1479
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,720
interest. They won't tell you their

1480
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,960
protocol. They won't tell you who

1481
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:19,279
they're testing with. They say, "No, you

1482
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,199
we will give you zero information. Pull

1483
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,839
$100,000 of product off the shelf this

1484
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,279
week. pull 200 off the shelf next week.

1485
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:28,318
We're up to a million dollars of

1486
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,720
embargoed product and zero transparency

1487
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:33,199
into what is going on. We have initiated

1488
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,799
every possible effort across our supply

1489
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:36,879
chain where you know we're looking at

1490
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,200
every single product that's out there

1491
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,920
short of microwaving the weed. There's

1492
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,358
no aspillus is [ __ ] I know. It's like

1493
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,960
that's what Australia and these other

1494
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:46,799
countries are doing. You get this weed

1495
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,358
and it's just [ __ ] zapped. It looks

1496
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,519
like a [ __ ] frozen dinner, you know,

1497
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:52,799
that you let defrost in the in the sun.

1498
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,599
It's disgusting. I'm not a big fan of

1499
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,039
cryocured weed either. Just putting that

1500
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,480
on the table, guys. It's not the I mean,

1501
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,239
I think it has its purpose maybe for

1502
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,440
extraction, but I hate astronaut ice

1503
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:05,519
cream weed. So, it's uh it's one of

1504
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,559
those things. But I got a question for

1505
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:11,199
you. So, I see this farm-to-table model

1506
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,040
that I would love to be able to execute

1507
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,399
properly and I see a lot of companies

1508
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:15,920
doing their best and I don't know what

1509
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,000
the solution is. I I realize

1510
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,599
distributors need refrigerated trucks.

1511
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,719
They need to have a temperature

1512
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,960
controlled environment where they're

1513
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,239
storing it in. Similar to how Logo Logan

1514
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,440
has their beer across the United States

1515
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,039
and across the world. It goes

1516
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,119
refrigerated till the time the consumer

1517
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,119
gets it. I think that would be ideal.

1518
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,838
But it's like how do we solve this

1519
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,200
problem to where a consumer goes in for

1520
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,119
the first time and they hear all about

1521
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,960
connected then they go buy it and

1522
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,559
they're not satisfied with the product

1523
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,119
and it's not because it's not good. It's

1524
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,559
because it's 6 months old. You know I

1525
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,760
and I don't know what the solution is.

1526
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:51,040
what's your opinion? So, we're working

1527
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,559
on that. Not I mean it it's for multiple

1528
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:56,239
reasons, but you know, for to have good

1529
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,480
sales, good and accurate sales and

1530
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:00,639
demand forecasting data. We're trying to

1531
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,079
get these retailers. So, I'll start at

1532
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,519
the retail level, right? Like there

1533
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,839
shouldn't be six-month old product on

1534
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:08,719
the shelves. Yeah. And for that, we need

1535
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:12,318
visibility into the retailers inventory.

1536
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:15,039
And in every other CPG product that is

1537
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:17,519
out there, it's in the b it's in the

1538
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:21,679
best interest of the retailer to give

1539
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:23,280
the the the supplier um insight into

1540
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,039
what is on their shelf cuz we don't want

1541
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,559
six-month old product on the shelf. I

1542
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,318
don't care how much money I got to lose

1543
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,599
if that didn't sell. We want that

1544
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:32,880
product. We want to replace it with

1545
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,440
fresh. But the unfortunately the retail

1546
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,920
network is is this hodge podge of people

1547
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,280
that have you know some of these guys

1548
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,599
including myself we've been in business

1549
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,079
for 15 years. We started on a shoestring

1550
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,880
budget and then you know we've developed

1551
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,119
over time. Well, okay, you've developed,

1552
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,119
but now we've got to, you know, we've

1553
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,559
got to further develop and you got to

1554
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:58,079
open yourselves up to to some of this uh

1555
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,839
data and allow the the provider to get

1556
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,240
insight into what's on the shelf cuz

1557
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,880
that's that's a product quality issue

1558
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,399
first and foremost. Um, but then it goes

1559
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,519
in, you know, and it plays into some of

1560
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,599
these other topics that we're talking

1561
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,679
about aspiggillis and a lot of these

1562
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,079
retailers are super resistant. It's like

1563
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:16,239
as if they give up some of their data

1564
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,760
that it's like, you know, giving up some

1565
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,000
secret proprietary information. Yeah.

1566
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,240
It's just like, but it's what's best for

1567
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,838
you. Like, if we have data into what's

1568
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:26,000
on your shelf, we'll come we'll swap it

1569
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,838
out. We'll and and we can backfill. By

1570
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,880
the way, if you sold out of something

1571
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:33,358
fast, we should you should want us to

1572
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,200
backfill it and put it in. Yeah. If if

1573
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,199
it's empty, if that if the spot for

1574
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,279
Biscotti is empty on your shelf cuz you

1575
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:40,798
sold it so fast, you're losing revenue.

1576
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,960
We're losing revenue. give us

1577
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:45,199
visibility, we'll we'll get back in and

1578
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,599
back fill it or take off the old stuff.

1579
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:48,960
Yeah, more data is better for the entire

1580
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,640
industry. And we see a lot of like

1581
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,119
people like holding stuff real close to

1582
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:56,078
their chest. Totally. That has to change

1583
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,240
the the California retail the entire

1584
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,400
supply chain in California needs to

1585
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,719
mature and we need an overhaul. I think

1586
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,639
for sure we we do and and it, you know,

1587
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,679
the retailers play a big role in that.

1588
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:09,598
Um and at the regulatory level, I mean,

1589
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,519
I just like I don't even know. I mean,

1590
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,760
they're they don't know what to look

1591
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:17,679
for. They don't seem to be interested in

1592
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,599
in, you know, communicating with the

1593
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:22,000
industry. It's almost like they see us

1594
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,838
as their opponent. So, it's like we

1595
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,798
we've we've struggled to have like a

1596
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:29,039
really solid voice, a unified voice. I

1597
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,599
think a lot of people this industry

1598
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,639
historically, particularly in

1599
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,640
California, has struggled to find a

1600
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,078
unified voice. There's a lot of egos.

1601
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:37,598
people can't seem to get along and

1602
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,440
people can't seem to, you know, it's

1603
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,519
like we all have a lot of things we'd

1604
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,440
like solved, right? But like we should

1605
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,000
narrow them down to like three and

1606
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:49,519
tackle those three as a group and we'll

1607
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,119
get to the other 15 some point or maybe

1608
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,960
never. But if we tackle the biggest

1609
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,358
things together, at least we're making

1610
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,358
an impact. And right now feels like a

1611
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,199
lot of everyone's just like on their own

1612
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,000
island and willing to stay that way.

1613
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:04,480
Mhm. Um, you know, C Elliott at

1614
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Catalyst, he he started a trade group.

1615
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,079
It's started as a retail trade

1616
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,960
association, but it's already expanded

1617
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,240
into brands and I think, you know, he's

1618
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,318
got some really he's got some of the

1619
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,078
biggest names in the retail space and

1620
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,960
some really solid brands. We're we're

1621
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,039
members of it. Um, I think that has a

1622
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,880
good opportunity. He's got, you know, a

1623
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,199
pretty good legal mind. He also

1624
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,039
understands the regulators. He's not

1625
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,558
afraid to, you know, shake a stick at

1626
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:32,159
them. Um, and I think that's critical.

1627
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,880
We've got to unify. We've got to create

1628
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:37,759
a voice to try to get some of these

1629
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,480
things. You know, what is best, you

1630
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,720
know, for at the end of the day, if you

1631
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,880
solve what's best for the consumer.

1632
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,480
Yeah. You know, you probably solve a lot

1633
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,200
of things. And it's not all about

1634
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,480
safety. Consumer's pretty safe. Like a

1635
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:52,558
lot of people have been smoking weed

1636
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,440
from a lot of bad sources with a lot of

1637
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,519
bad [ __ ] on it for a long time. And I'm

1638
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,440
glad that that time's done. Yeah, but

1639
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:02,559
let's not over right now. It's being

1640
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,798
overregulated out of fear. It's react.

1641
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,559
It's reactionary. It's the most

1642
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:08,400
regulated agriculture product in

1643
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,319
existence. There's nothing that's

1644
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,519
regulated like cannabis to that level,

1645
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:14,079
right? And it's definitely

1646
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,920
overregulated. And you know, it's it's

1647
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,440
sad to a degree. I mean, I think all

1648
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,920
these things will get worked out over

1649
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:24,159
time hopefully. Uh at least that's the

1650
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,880
hope. It's just like how how many good

1651
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:30,159
brands or how many good companies, how

1652
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,798
many good products will fail to continue

1653
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:35,279
to see the light of day or you know in

1654
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:36,960
that time. It's almost like like I'm not

1655
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,319
a big conspiracy theorist, but it's

1656
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,358
almost like you could put on your foil

1657
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:44,639
hat and be like if there was to be a

1658
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:47,920
bigger play to really consolidate this

1659
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:49,679
industry down to, you know, whoever can

1660
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,760
who's ever really got the biggest wallet

1661
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,440
and who can stand here the longest.

1662
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,720
Yeah. You know, it feels like this would

1663
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,480
be a pretty good way to do it. How

1664
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,558
they're going about it just feels like

1665
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,798
that's going on right now for a lot of

1666
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,480
us and and it's really unfortunate. And

1667
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,599
then you've got the hemp thing, you

1668
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,599
know, which is like it's it's honestly

1669
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,119
laughable really like what's happening.

1670
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,720
It's like look at Texas, right? I think

1671
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,640
that's changing in Texas, but yeah, it's

1672
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:13,759
Well, they're trying to, but some people

1673
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:15,358
think it's not going to go because

1674
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,960
there's so much money behind this M

1675
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,719
thing. It's like all of us in the

1676
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,480
cannabis space have tried so long and

1677
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,798
put so much blood, sweat, and tears and

1678
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,880
so much money into this and then we're

1679
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:26,318
just watching this thing happen.

1680
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,280
Totally. You know, and a lot of us are

1681
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:32,159
are playing a role in it. And look, I

1682
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,559
don't fall on either side. I'm like I'm

1683
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,399
like I'm a get money. Like if you can

1684
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,000
get your money, you get your money. And

1685
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,680
I'm never going to I don't want to hate

1686
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,679
I don't hate on anyone in the hemp

1687
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,078
space. I'm hating on the regulators.

1688
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,838
It's like make up your [ __ ] mind for

1689
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,079
sure. Like I just want I just want to

1690
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:50,880
know what's what. And if that's if I

1691
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:53,280
need to go play in that space to to

1692
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,240
appreciate what full-blown legalization

1693
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,640
looks like, fine. like that I'm going to

1694
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,479
go do that and I'll keep this, you know,

1695
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:01,920
this propped up over here. Problem is

1696
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,960
they keep moving the needle. So the

1697
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,240
second you jump over there, they're

1698
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,760
like, "Nope, now that's not allowed."

1699
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:07,358
And then you're stuck back over here and

1700
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,440
then they allow it again. And I think

1701
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,119
it's just such an unstable market right

1702
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,400
now. It's really hard to tell which

1703
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,680
direction. Someone who is a hard worker

1704
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,119
and wants to invest their money

1705
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:20,000
properly, it's almost impossible to

1706
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,920
guess what's next right now. Yeah. And

1707
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,880
and so once again, it like goes back to

1708
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,880
the wallet and and the pair of, you

1709
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,960
know, nuts you've got. It's like how big

1710
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,880
and how crazy are you willing to go and

1711
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,280
how are you going to push it? And time

1712
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,599
and time again, it's those folks that

1713
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,440
seem to like I've just always taken the

1714
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,359
stance. I'm like, oh, you know, cuz I

1715
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,519
[ __ ] dude, I used to do everything

1716
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:44,078
illegal and I had all those sleepless

1717
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:46,400
nights and you know, every van was

1718
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:49,599
potentially the end of my life. like

1719
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,358
every van parked on my street ever was

1720
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,599
potential. I was always thought that

1721
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:56,798
there could be someone someone in it and

1722
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,318
I don't miss those days at all. And but

1723
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:00,079
then it's like it feels like it's going

1724
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,079
back to it's not quite like that but

1725
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,880
it's like you got to be willing to just

1726
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:07,318
take all these crazy risks and and just

1727
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:10,480
put yourself out there. I mean weed is

1728
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:12,159
being shipped internationally right now

1729
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,000
on a scale and I'm not talking about the

1730
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,480
legal shipment. So like what is

1731
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,039
happening, you know, outside the legal

1732
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:23,039
network that is coming from the legal

1733
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,558
network is is [ __ ] mindblowing. And

1734
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,199
it's wild. And the thing is is they

1735
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,920
could be making tax money off this. So

1736
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:31,039
much so much money in international, you

1737
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,960
know, I I think there's all these

1738
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,639
international markets and we we produce

1739
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,400
the best cannabis in the world, right?

1740
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:37,759
The United States. I think that's not

1741
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,680
even a question. It's not even a

1742
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,200
question. Yeah. It's And the thing is is

1743
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,199
we could be exporting to Germany right

1744
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,399
now. Everyone wants our product, right?

1745
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,318
The thing is is we're not allowed to

1746
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,920
export it and it just sucks, right? It

1747
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:49,440
sucks for a lot of us that I think would

1748
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,599
be benefiting from it, including the

1749
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,119
government. Yeah. It's disheartening.

1750
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,960
And I think there was it was either

1751
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,720
today or yesterday there's a new article

1752
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,358
that or a new, you know, mention says

1753
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:01,759
White House does not see rescheduling as

1754
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,920
a priority. Yeah. Big surprise. I mean,

1755
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,079
it's just once again, you go back to the

1756
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,119
tinfoil hat. It's like are we being

1757
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:12,640
given like a about as clear message as

1758
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,480
we'll ever get like this is not the path

1759
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,558
like this will not the race to the

1760
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,798
bottom and then everyone that survives

1761
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,559
this race is going to be very successful

1762
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,239
I and I'm I'm in it for the long haul.

1763
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,519
You're in it for the long haul. I'm not

1764
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:24,798
going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere.

1765
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:26,480
I don't have anywhere else to go for one

1766
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:28,239
thing. That's the I've come to that

1767
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,079
realization. I'm like what? There's

1768
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:33,759
nowhere else to go. This is the life

1769
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,200
I've chosen. No. But it sounds like you

1770
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,319
are. You're not going to go back to the

1771
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:37,919
kitchen, but you're going to bring this

1772
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:40,000
into it. I'm going to Everything I do

1773
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,680
circles back to genetics, right? So,

1774
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,760
everything we do, we are going to do a

1775
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:45,279
cooking show. And I love I love being

1776
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,920
able to cook on that level. But if I had

1777
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,760
to cook every day, I'm I'm a workaholic.

1778
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,960
So, if I cook, I want to if I own a

1779
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,400
restaurant, I'm going to work there 16

1780
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,519
hours a day, seven days a week. And I

1781
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,280
don't that's not the life I want to

1782
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:57,199
live, right? But I love cooking for my

1783
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,119
friends. And I love being able to

1784
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,399
provide an The thing is is like with

1785
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,838
cannabis and all these things, I provide

1786
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,760
an experience, right? If I can provide

1787
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,038
an experience for people, that's what I

1788
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,799
love more than anything. Especially for

1789
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,240
my friends, because I feel like that's

1790
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,400
what life's all about, too. If you break

1791
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,598
it all down, life's about experiences.

1792
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,880
Like, those are the things you can't

1793
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,960
really buy. Yeah, you can buy a

1794
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,480
vacation, but it's those experiences you

1795
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,798
have on those vacations that make it

1796
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,318
memorable. Yeah. And uh you know, I've

1797
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:23,199
had some amazing experiences with

1798
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:25,440
friends and I've cooked for a lot of a

1799
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,719
lot of people and had great experiences.

1800
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,400
I think they've had great experiences

1801
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,159
from it, too. But I get personal

1802
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,680
satisfaction from providing the

1803
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:34,159
experience. And so doing a cooking show,

1804
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,078
that's that's a lot of fun. Now, how

1805
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:38,239
will we be incorporated into the cooking

1806
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,720
show? Like, is it is the weed going to

1807
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:43,279
be in the food or is it just going to

1808
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,199
No, no, I don't put weed in food. That

1809
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,200
is not, you know, I first of all, I

1810
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,960
can't handle it. So, no. I I enjoy rosin

1811
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:50,399
gummies from time to time or whatever. I

1812
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,599
get the 10 milligrams and I bite a

1813
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,960
little piece off them. You know what I

1814
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,318
mean? I'm not I'm not really Everyone's

1815
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,639
like, "Are you serious?" I'm like, "I am

1816
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:58,159
the biggest lightweight when it comes to

1817
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,440
edibles." Like, give me some mushrooms.

1818
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:00,798
I don't care. I'll eat I'll eat the [ __ ]

1819
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,200
out of some mushrooms. When it comes to

1820
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,119
edibles, I go light. But the thing is I

1821
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:06,639
smoke a lot, right? So I enjoy. So what

1822
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,760
we're doing and my show was I was just

1823
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,400
going to cook for my friends and of

1824
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,920
course my partner, he's like, "Okay, so

1825
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,240
how do we bring this back to genetics?"

1826
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,639
I got this idea and so we're going to do

1827
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,399
icas style and we're going to do like,

1828
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,480
you know, five to seven courses and with

1829
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,400
each course you're either going to get a

1830
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,679
dab or you're going to smoke a joint or

1831
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,519
you're going to try one of these new

1832
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:27,038
devices that people have and it's going

1833
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:28,639
to be with our genetics, right? So, we

1834
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,799
pair the the food with the different

1835
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:33,038
courses. It's all bite-sized stuff. And

1836
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:34,400
then I got Cubone, who's Snoop Dog's

1837
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,799
personal chef. He's going to come on as

1838
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,838
my sue chef initially. No way. And uh

1839
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:39,358
it's going to be a lot of fun. And then

1840
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,679
we can have, you know, five or six

1841
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:43,199
people in there. And uh we can mic them

1842
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:46,719
all up and have good conversations. And

1843
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:48,239
I feel like I like being able to set

1844
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,239
people up with other people to where we

1845
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:52,239
have great conversations. And then it's

1846
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:53,519
like if you get a diverse enough crowd,

1847
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,719
you can talk about some really cool

1848
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,559
stuff. That's really exciting. I'm I I

1849
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,519
refuse to use the word foodie, but I'm a

1850
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,680
food aaholic. I just love food. I've

1851
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,838
never cooked professionally. Yeah. But I

1852
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:07,440
cook, you know, almost every single

1853
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:09,759
night in my house and every single

1854
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,760
morning I make my kids their their

1855
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,760
breakfast every morning and I and I cook

1856
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,160
for the family every night. Um I love

1857
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,760
cooking for my friends. you know, as as

1858
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:20,480
I've gotten busier over the years, I

1859
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,520
found it harder to do like the more the

1860
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:28,400
more complex longer, you know, longer

1861
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:30,559
time uh you know, cooks or whatever. But

1862
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,000
I a lot of people try to do like the

1863
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,000
weed thing and they want to incorporate

1864
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,599
the weed into the food. In fact, there's

1865
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,280
a restaurant in Sacramento, Michelin

1866
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,680
Star Localis, and like they did this

1867
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,798
really cool dinner for us once and they

1868
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:44,798
put weed in the food and no one's ever

1869
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:49,000
done it as good as they did. Yeah. But

1870
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:51,038
still, I was so [ __ ] high, it became

1871
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,159
unenjoyable, you know? It's just too

1872
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:57,039
much. And they had the they had the uh

1873
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:58,558
the infused option and the non-infused.

1874
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,160
And my wife was like, "Absolutely not.

1875
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,200
She will not touch any weed, edible,

1876
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:03,118
any." She's like, "I want the

1877
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:04,558
non-infused." And somehow some of the

1878
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,480
stuff got into it. And she was like

1879
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,880
scared high. And it was like it's

1880
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,960
dangerous. It's like weed in food is

1881
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,880
dangerous. Um Yeah. Just the way it

1882
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,400
reacts cuz everyone's body chemistry is

1883
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,559
so different. And if you're not used to

1884
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,480
it, it it'll give you that paranoia,

1885
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,760
right? And smoking does not give me

1886
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,240
paranoia. I can smoke the strongest

1887
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,079
sativas and maybe I might get a little

1888
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,519
paranoia for about a minute or five

1889
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:27,200
minutes, but that goes away really fast.

1890
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:30,239
Whereas edibles, it just like doesn't go

1891
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:31,759
away. Then you want it to be over. Uh

1892
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,078
and it's almost like a bad trip because

1893
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,680
it doesn't end, right? And yeah. So, I

1894
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,920
mean, I've I've eaten edibles where I'm

1895
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:39,358
like high for eight hours or 10 hours

1896
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,079
and you wake up the next day and you

1897
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:43,440
have a weed hangover, which is absurd.

1898
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,880
And then I got friends that need 1,000

1899
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,318
milligrams like it's nothing, you know,

1900
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,559
but they can't hang with the smoking,

1901
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,719
too. So, a lot of them the way they

1902
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,079
absorb it. Yeah, that's that's really

1903
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:54,798
cool that you're you're going to do

1904
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:56,240
that. Um hopefully we can uh link up

1905
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:58,159
again on that. Um we'll get you down

1906
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:59,598
here for sure. Yeah, we we want to do

1907
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:01,598
we've I've been doing a little bit more

1908
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,160
content stuff and we did like a a little

1909
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,440
steak thing and I I I'm big on steak. I

1910
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,519
think you know, we talked earlier before

1911
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,480
the show that I'm I'm eating a lot of a

1912
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:12,559
lot of red meat and uh it's all

1913
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,559
encompassing, right? like we grow some

1914
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,400
of the most amazing products and this is

1915
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,719
it gets better and better looking and

1916
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,798
tasting as we get as we hone our craft

1917
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,798
and then tying it into the kitchen. I

1918
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,079
mean, I love smoking when I'm cooking.

1919
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,000
It's one of the nice things about having

1920
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:27,439
a great hood. Oh, yeah. You know, you're

1921
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,039
a good cook and you can cook a lot of

1922
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,399
steak, you got to have a great hood, but

1923
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,560
then you got the joint right there and

1924
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,838
it just takes it right out. That's for

1925
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,759
sure. That's the only place I'm allowed

1926
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,679
to smoke in the house, right? Me, too.

1927
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,198
Literally, cuz the house joints smoke up

1928
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,158
they they'll make your house smell bad.

1929
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,879
Yeah. Right. So, if you had one piece of

1930
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,838
advice for your younger

1931
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:49,759
self, what would that one piece of

1932
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:52,399
advice be? Go harder. I I I remained

1933
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,000
relatively restrained. Mhm. Like when

1934
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,079
people are just throwing up more lights

1935
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,679
and you know, you know, now that being

1936
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:59,119
said, we were in Sacramento, which is in

1937
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,640
the Eastern District, the Eastern

1938
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,238
Federal District. Yeah. Where they

1939
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:06,400
actually sent a number of legal cannabis

1940
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:08,798
folks to prison, federal prison, you

1941
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:11,198
know. So, I don't know. I don't want to

1942
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,960
say I regret it, but you know, I would

1943
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:15,759
have definitely encouraged, you know,

1944
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:18,158
reinvest more of the profits. You know,

1945
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:20,719
speaking of profit, Luke Scarzo did 14

1946
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,679
years and he owned a dispensary. Yeah.

1947
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,359
Yeah. He That's not why he did prison

1948
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:28,079
time. He said, "Fuck the feds." Yeah.

1949
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:32,480
So, I actually knew Luke. I met Luke in

1950
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:35,278
I think 200 I think 200 I think either

1951
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,119
99 or 2000. He came up to Chico. He was

1952
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,199
real good friends with one of the guys

1953
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,960
uh that I was living with and I met him

1954
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:44,238
up there. He stayed at our house and he

1955
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,920
was super cool dude. Um and and then

1956
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:47,678
they opened that spot and the guy that I

1957
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,838
lived with uh helped him run his

1958
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,199
dispensaries for a while and we tried to

1959
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:53,439
sell him a little product and he was

1960
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:55,919
just like it was just so crazy. It was

1961
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:58,000
so bananas and it was in Modesto and so

1962
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,440
we stayed you know we kept our distance

1963
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,119
not because uh you know for any other

1964
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:05,039
reason other than it was just like a

1965
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:07,359
little it was a little crazy you know it

1966
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:09,119
was like hectic like this is this seems

1967
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,960
a little I don't want to say I felt like

1968
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,119
it was hot but it was like it was either

1969
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,039
hot for getting jacked or like hot for

1970
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,840
something. It just felt like right that

1971
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,439
place was cracking a little too hard. Um

1972
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,719
it was pretty unfortunate what happened

1973
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:25,439
to him. I mean, it's probably one of the

1974
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:28,158
worst, you know, worst cannabis uh war

1975
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:30,158
stories. Um, I think him and Richard

1976
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,759
Delissi, those two stories, I mean,

1977
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:33,920
there's there's lots of bad stories

1978
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,360
about guys that went away for something

1979
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,199
they shouldn't they would never have

1980
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:40,000
gone away today for, for one thing. But,

1981
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:42,960
Right. But yeah, and then Uncle Rick did

1982
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,119
32 calendar years for cannabis. That's

1983
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,840
just with circumstantial evidence on

1984
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:50,640
this the the long stint he did. Wow. You

1985
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,840
know, it's really sad in Florida.

1986
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,600
Yeah, that's super gnarly. Um, I mean,

1987
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,960
we were It was close. I mean, you

1988
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,679
remember that whole Hayward the the not

1989
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,800
I think it was Hayward. There was the

1990
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:07,359
what it was Operation Delta,

1991
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,960
the the hydro stores that got busted.

1992
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,399
So, you know, I didn't even know those

1993
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,640
guys. I had never even been to their

1994
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,879
store, right? And I when that happened,

1995
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,400
the lawyer was like, "Hey, do you know

1996
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,159
any of these guys? Read these names."

1997
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:21,238
And I was like, "Nope, didn't know none

1998
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:24,319
of them rang a bell." And

1999
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:26,399
um then like three, four months later, I

2000
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:29,198
get a call from my HVAC contractor and

2001
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:30,879
he's like, "Hey, one of you know," he

2002
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,960
knew one of the guys. He's like, "Hey, I

2003
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,319
got a message from the electrician, this

2004
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,198
guy Brian. You know, you guys are when

2005
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:40,799
they raided him for that whole thing,

2006
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:42,559
they were like, "Tell us about Caleb

2007
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,239
Counts. Tell us about free health." Blah

2008
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,120
blah. What do you know? And turned out

2009
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:49,119
that electrician had done some work at

2010
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:52,158
our facility through another contact who

2011
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:54,238
was Bay Area, you know, right? And we

2012
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:55,679
were like, "Holy shit." And that was

2013
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,158
enough. My lawyer's like, "Yeah, you're

2014
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:00,640
under federal investigation. They don't

2015
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:02,960
if they interrogated him during a raid

2016
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,880
about you and listed all the names and

2017
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,880
all the the companies that that were

2018
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,719
affiliated with you, you are under

2019
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,079
federal investigation and you are likely

2020
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,840
next. You should be out of the business

2021
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:13,600
in 24 hours if you don't want to go to

2022
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,960
prison." Yeah. And that was like one of

2023
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,360
the most, you know, sobering

2024
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,800
conversations I had ever had. And I had

2025
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,799
to pick up the phone and make the call

2026
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,239
like dispensary every gram of flowers

2027
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,400
out of that place before close of

2028
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,319
business and call the grows and say

2029
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,960
every plant is cut down, pulled out of

2030
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:32,639
the ground, thrown in the trash. Wow. 24

2031
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,600
hours I was a ghost. I was out of the

2032
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,400
cannabis business. This was in 200 into

2033
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,640
end of 2011. I think it was 2012, early

2034
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,879
2012. Mhm. I was out of the cannabis

2035
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,920
business. And um yeah, like my my lawyer

2036
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,199
said, he's like, "You should be a

2037
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,119
ghost." And so luckily, you know, we got

2038
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,479
that information. You know, I don't I

2039
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:54,158
still don't remember his last name, but

2040
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,678
if Brian's listening, he's from the Bay

2041
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:58,399
Area. He was an electrician. Thank you

2042
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,480
so much. I owe that guy pretty much, I

2043
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:03,119
guess, in some ways, my life, you know,

2044
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,399
cuz then they went and raided my next,

2045
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:06,399
you know, one of my competitors who was

2046
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,960
a friend of mine, El Camino Wellness.

2047
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:10,238
They raided him uh three weeks later.

2048
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,279
Wow. Wow. And then my lawyer was like,

2049
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:15,439
"You were they probably just went from

2050
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:17,279
you and realized you're out of the

2051
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:19,279
business and then went to him." Yeah.

2052
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:21,039
And luckily he didn't go to prison, but

2053
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:22,479
they took everything from him. And he's

2054
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:23,920
a real He's a real successful real

2055
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:26,000
estate agent now. He's still a real

2056
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,239
estate agent. And he would I'm sure he

2057
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,760
would not have chose that path. He was

2058
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,919
good in the weed business and killing

2059
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:35,119
it. And uh it changed the direction of

2060
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:37,600
his life dramatically. Yeah. So, I'm I'm

2061
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:40,640
glad that somehow after all the [ __ ]

2062
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,320
I've done, I remained unscathed until

2063
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,320
the airport incident, you know. Did you

2064
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,000
hear about that? I did hear a little bit

2065
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,759
of that. You You're bringing pre-roll

2066
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
joints or something like that. Yeah, I

2067
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,679
was traveling from California to Arizona

2068
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,960
and I was just bringing them a few. I

2069
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:59,679
mean, it's like it was like uh

2070
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:03,279
20 I think 20 jars of 2 No, it was 25

2071
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:05,760
jars of 2.5 gram. samples of our of our

2072
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:08,479
infused pre-rolls um to show them you

2073
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,400
know what it looked like and you know

2074
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,559
certainly if I would have have sold them

2075
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:14,879
at full retail pop I wouldn't have even

2076
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,880
recuperated the cost of my ticket so I

2077
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,880
definitely wasn't trafficking in sales

2078
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,960
which is what I got charged with for

2079
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,880
sure possession with intent to sell

2080
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,039
started as a misdemeanor they upgraded

2081
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,480
it to a felony well yeah so they let you

2082
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:28,000
go everything was all good and yeah they

2083
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,399
just write a ticket right then and there

2084
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,679
and say hey you know the cop even I

2085
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,238
think He started he was a real

2086
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,399
aggressive at first and I think he

2087
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:38,718
started to realize this is kind of this

2088
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,799
is a little much you know and he started

2089
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,800
to like make excuses kind of which was

2090
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,239
weird you know when they're like feel

2091
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,679
like they have to justify what they're

2092
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:47,839
doing you feel like they're kind of

2093
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,199
feeling bad about it and then we ended

2094
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,719
up being on the tram cuz I missed my

2095
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,719
flight we took the tram back that

2096
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,000
Sacramento airport and we ended up being

2097
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,520
the only it was like 6:00 in the morning

2098
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,479
we were the only ones on it he's like

2099
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,320
you know in the future just check it you

2100
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,399
know if you check this stuff we'll never

2101
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:04,479
catch it. I'm like, the guy that just

2102
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:06,879
busted me is giving me advice on how to

2103
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:09,279
further traffic marijuana, in his words,

2104
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,960
traffic marijuana and and not get

2105
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:13,599
busted. So, it was surreal. And then

2106
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,198
they when my lawyer went to go to court,

2107
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,199
he was like, "You're not on the docket.

2108
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:18,238
I don't know what's up. Give me the case

2109
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:19,599
number again." Gave it to him. He's

2110
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:21,919
like, "Dude, they upgraded you to a

2111
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,600
felony." And then they just would not

2112
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,199
negotiate. They were like, they were

2113
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,679
getting a conviction no matter what.

2114
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:29,439
They're like, "We got you dead rights.

2115
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,880
We want this possession with intent to

2116
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:32,639
distribute. If not, we'll give you

2117
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,079
interstate drug trafficking. Drug

2118
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,400
trafficking if you'd like because you

2119
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:39,600
had a ticket to Arizona. Well, I just

2120
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:41,519
had an experience at SFO. SFO of all

2121
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,880
places. So, I was actually going

2122
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,760
international and I had a little bit of

2123
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,239
my personal and I I was going through

2124
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,960
security and literally I was going there

2125
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:52,479
to film Mila for her 80th birthday and

2126
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,279
so I had a little bit of my personal or

2127
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:57,678
whatever and I go through and I'm fine

2128
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:59,439
through security going through the I

2129
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,719
scan my ticket and I'm walking through

2130
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,879
the tunnel and the guy's like, "How much

2131
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,039
cash you have on you?" I'm like, "400

2132
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,800
bucks and maybe some euros like 60 bucks

2133
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:07,920
in euros or something like that." He's

2134
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,520
like, "You smell like weed. How much

2135
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,880
weed do you have on you?" I'm like, "A

2136
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,400
little bit of personal." He's like,

2137
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,719
"Okay, let's take a look at it." So,

2138
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,879
they start taking out and he's like,

2139
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,000
"What's this?" I'm like, "Uh, that's a

2140
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,719
little bit of extract. There was a

2141
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
little bit of rosin in there." And then

2142
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,359
he's like, "Well, where's the flower?"

2143
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,039
And I'm like, "Well, you'd put it on the

2144
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:27,599
counter." He didn't even realize it was

2145
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:29,840
in there. And like, so I'm like, "So, my

2146
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,920
flight's about to leave. Am I good to

2147
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,840
go? You know, what's what's going on?"

2148
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,520
Uh, and he's like, "I got to talk to my

2149
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,960
supervisor." I'm like, "You've got to be

2150
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,159
kidding." So, I miss my flight. They

2151
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,719
take me in the back. Where where were

2152
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:43,519
you flying? Barcelona for spanabis.

2153
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,520
Spanabis. So they probably are. So yeah.

2154
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,440
And so basically I mean I don't know if

2155
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,679
I was profiled or whatever, but

2156
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:51,599
basically they uh went in the back and

2157
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,199
they searched my stuff and that's all I

2158
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,880
had. I declared it, you know, and it's

2159
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,519
like I they asked me. I told them I had

2160
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:00,079
it. Uh they let me go. They signed I

2161
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,159
basically had Oh, the funny thing is the

2162
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:03,439
first they took four tests on the

2163
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:05,439
flower. It was some Skittles. It was

2164
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:08,158
harvested early. It was super fresh. The

2165
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:10,479
first three it didn't test for Delta 9.

2166
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,158
It didn't pop dirty. The fourth one it

2167
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:13,759
like slightly changed color so they took

2168
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:15,839
a picture with that one and they

2169
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,440
confiscated it and let me on my way but

2170
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,679
uh and they were actually pretty polite

2171
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,439
about the whole thing. Um you know but I

2172
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,158
learned a lesson. I missed my flight. I

2173
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:28,799
had to fly 24 hours later.

2174
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:30,399
Sucked. Yeah. So, I think a bunch of

2175
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,800
people got in trouble flying over there

2176
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:36,079
with stuff. And it's like really I just

2177
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,840
I have a hard time flying anywhere with

2178
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:39,359
not knowing what kind of cannabis is

2179
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,119
going to be there. I enjoy my medicine.

2180
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,039
I treat it like medicine. I believe it's

2181
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,399
medicine. Yeah. I have a doctor's

2182
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,679
recommendation still. I'm one of those

2183
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:47,599
people that still gets doctor's

2184
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,279
recommendations, especially after that

2185
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,400
incident. I have I make sure to keep

2186
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:54,079
mine to date. And totally. And so, I

2187
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:55,198
mean, I think I think of it as medicine.

2188
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:56,479
And I feel like we should be able to

2189
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:58,079
travel. We can travel with anything

2190
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:59,759
else. else they can travel with, you

2191
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:01,279
know, any sort of pills, so why can't we

2192
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,840
travel with cannabis? And that that

2193
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:06,399
really has to change. Yeah. I actually

2194
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:09,440
just had an incident in uh Cabo's

2195
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:11,279
airport and yeah, they profiled me for

2196
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:12,799
sure cuz I pressed the button, it was

2197
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,479
green, and he was like, "Nope, you come

2198
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,480
right over." Oh, wow. They I watched

2199
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:18,399
them profiling people. They're profiling

2200
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:20,238
mostly people of color. I was the only

2201
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,879
one that wasn't. But I noticed everyone

2202
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:27,839
else they pulled over was someone of

2203
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:29,520
color, which is shitty. But um they

2204
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,600
searched my [ __ ] They're like, "Tell us

2205
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,760
where it is. Where's the weed? Where is

2206
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,120
the weed? Where is the weed?" And I'm

2207
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,480
like, "I don't have anything. I don't

2208
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,399
have anything." They're like, "CBD? You

2209
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,639
have CBD? Huh? Huh? You have CBD?" I'm

2210
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,559
like, "No, I don't." And they like went

2211
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,159
in my I have like, you know, a little

2212
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,000
pill container that has like a bunch of

2213
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:48,000
mixed, you know, just random onesie,

2214
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,158
twoozies of [ __ ] that I They're my

2215
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
backup like in case I forgot, you know,

2216
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,319
my vitamins or my medication or

2217
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,279
whatever. It's like it's like the random

2218
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:59,679
[ __ ] And there was three

2219
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:02,840
uh the heavy hitters, they're my

2220
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:04,800
favorite uh sleep uh the heavy hitter

2221
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,119
CBN's. They have five I think they have

2222
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,400
five or 10 milligrams of THC and and

2223
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:10,640
they're like, you know, what's this?

2224
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:12,879
What's this? Cuz it has no it's just a

2225
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,800
pressed pill. It has no label on it. And

2226
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,000
I'm like, fine, that's

2227
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:22,320
CBD. And and they're like,

2228
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,760
ah. And that was like the admission. And

2229
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:25,119
then they went deeper. Then they pulled

2230
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,159
my wife aside. Then they went through

2231
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:28,880
her [ __ ] They're like, "Tell us where

2232
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,559
the weed at." Like, "Fuck." And they

2233
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,920
brought out a test machine and they're

2234
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:36,000
breaking up the pill and they're putting

2235
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:39,279
it on the thing and and then they uh and

2236
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,279
it wasn't popping, you know, and so they

2237
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,679
called over another guy. I I mean this

2238
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:46,158
guy looked much more studious like had a

2239
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:47,760
different machine and he just tested

2240
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:49,679
they were testing a bunch of other pills

2241
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,440
that I had cuz I have all these I take

2242
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,039
supplements they tested and the guy was

2243
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:54,559
like vitamina you could tell he was

2244
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:57,039
annoyed at the other guy who was like

2245
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,280
all gungho like thought he had a bust on

2246
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:02,158
his hands and the guy was like vitamina

2247
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:04,158
vitamina vitamina vitamina you know to

2248
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:06,399
everything even the CBD they

2249
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:08,000
acknowledged was they're like no it's a

2250
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,238
he was like it's a vitamin there's no

2251
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,238
THC which is funny it's

2252
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:14,559
It's [ __ ] bizarre, right? What we

2253
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:17,439
have to deal with. Yeah. It's wild for

2254
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,280
something we believe in so so firmly

2255
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:20,639
believe in that, you know, I feel like

2256
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:21,759
it makes the world a better place. And

2257
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,119
then there's people out there that are

2258
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,199
like, "No, people should still be going

2259
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,880
to jail for it." It's like those people

2260
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:28,238
are going to die off very soon, you

2261
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,760
know, in the near future. And I think

2262
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,879
the younger generation starting to get

2263
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,640
it. I hope. I don't even think the vast

2264
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,119
majority of people that are still

2265
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:40,560
putting people in jail believe that we

2266
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:44,960
should be. Mhm. It's like some weird

2267
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:46,480
power trip like upper hand. Like I think

2268
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,760
behind the scenes most of those people

2269
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,678
are like I don't give a [ __ ] about

2270
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,320
anything. You know, I've just I've come

2271
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:54,960
in contact with so many people who

2272
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:58,000
they're, you know, you find out one way,

2273
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,239
shape or form that, you know, off camera

2274
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,079
or whatever. You know, not exactly off

2275
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:03,599
camera, but like in the comfort of their

2276
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:06,158
own home, in their own private circles,

2277
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,400
they have a totally different stance of

2278
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,238
what they'll say. But then they've got

2279
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:11,599
they feel like they have to keep. It's

2280
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:14,559
either like this power trip or this

2281
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,480
image thing. And I think a lot of it is

2282
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,039
image, you know, that they feel like

2283
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:20,718
they have to for their voters or for,

2284
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:23,119
you know, their peers that they have to

2285
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:24,800
keep perpetuating that they don't even

2286
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:26,880
believe anymore. Yeah. And they're just

2287
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,119
doing it because they don't feel like

2288
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,560
they could acknowledge that they were

2289
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:32,800
wrong or that they have a different

2290
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,960
opinion. I think that is the I think

2291
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,800
that is a large majority of what is

2292
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,079
still that and the people that feel like

2293
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,840
they're just following the law. And I

2294
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:41,119
feel like the guys at SFO that I was

2295
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,480
dealing with, they felt like they were

2296
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,719
just following the law. They were very

2297
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:46,559
respectful, but also I was breaking the

2298
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:49,840
law. And so you can't break the law. And

2299
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,520
I I unfortunately the only way for us to

2300
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,199
get legalization, the reason we're here,

2301
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,880
why it's legal, is because we had to do

2302
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:56,638
things illegally. Had we not done that,

2303
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,239
it would still be illegal. There's no

2304
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,560
doubt in my mind. cannabis would still

2305
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:02,879
be illegal if it wasn't for the outlaws

2306
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,520
that kind of pushed it forward. I think

2307
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,359
about that often and it's like, you

2308
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,719
know, I played such a small role in it.

2309
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:10,238
There's people that like that you

2310
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:13,198
discussed earlier that that they gave

2311
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:15,519
their their literal lives, you know, or

2312
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,000
big chunk of their lives and there have

2313
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,800
been so many people that have laid it

2314
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,319
down, you know, and a lot of them, you

2315
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,719
know, it was for personal interest, but

2316
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:27,599
at the end of the day, like they they

2317
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:31,520
chose to to make their story heard and

2318
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:34,400
to and to be an example and and to sort

2319
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,880
of lend their story to to the rest of us

2320
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,479
to to continue charging forward. It is

2321
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,480
truly a war. When you stand back and

2322
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:42,959
think about it, it is a war. There have

2323
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:44,959
been many, many casualties and there

2324
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,480
continues to be. And the casualties are

2325
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,399
showing up in different ways now. Now,

2326
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:50,479
it's just bu millions and millions of

2327
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:52,799
dollars being flushed down the drain.

2328
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:55,559
People that have tried to do it right

2329
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:58,159
and weren't able to overcome the the

2330
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,639
overburden overly burdensome tax

2331
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:02,238
structure, regulatory structure. I mean,

2332
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,600
it feels like they're trying to put us

2333
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:05,599
out of business right now with this

2334
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,199
aspillus thing. right? You know, and I

2335
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,520
don't know if you saw, you know,

2336
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,839
recently they recently changed the u

2337
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:16,239
they recently did a major cut to the

2338
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:18,960
number of the pesticides and and and IPM

2339
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:20,718
uh stuff that we can use. I mean,

2340
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,639
already we were stricter. This is what

2341
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:25,079
almost no one knows this. We already had

2342
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:28,079
stricter requirements than organic

2343
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:30,559
certification like by a long shot. like

2344
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:33,760
we already had significantly stricter

2345
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,600
and they just took a an axe to what we

2346
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,760
could use previously and now the list is

2347
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,400
even smaller. I mean what we're allowed

2348
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:43,520
to use to prevent, you know, crop loss

2349
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:44,960
is ridiculous and it makes no sense and

2350
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,840
it's not tied to science. That's the

2351
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,840
thing. It's tied to fear. Mhm. And

2352
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,039
unfortunately most things are. Yeah.

2353
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:55,199
Yeah. That's a good point. But uh I mean

2354
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:56,960
I I have positive outlook on on

2355
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,279
everything. I'm I'm hoping for the best,

2356
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,198
you know. It's like we can only hope,

2357
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,559
but uh you know, it's like some things

2358
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:05,439
aren't looking too good and other things

2359
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,320
are looking great. Yeah. I the the way

2360
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:10,319
cannabis is spreading internationally is

2361
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:13,519
really exciting right now. I mean, it's

2362
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:16,079
it's it's bittersweet because while it's

2363
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,920
expanded in the United States, it seems

2364
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,000
to have reached a limit. You know, it's

2365
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,359
bumping up against that right now. But

2366
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,198
what's happening on the international

2367
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,119
landscape and the opportunity to do

2368
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:27,439
business in all these other countries?

2369
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,960
Like I, you know, having to do all these

2370
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:30,319
calls at weird hours or talking to

2371
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,520
people in different countries. It sounds

2372
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:33,279
like you've been doing that for a long

2373
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,120
time. Yeah. But it's like I I actually

2374
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:37,039
took a step back the other day cuz I was

2375
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,880
like, "Oh, these [ __ ] 5:00 a.m. calls

2376
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,560
or you or I feel bad for them that

2377
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,800
they're getting on at 8:00 p.m. where

2378
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,520
they're at." And then I realized I'm

2379
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,760
like, "Wow, how lucky are we? I'm

2380
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,000
dealing with someone whose first

2381
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,920
language is in English and we're talking

2382
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,920
about doing business together. Yeah. And

2383
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,560
they live, you know, they're nine,

2384
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,880
eight, nine, 12 hours, you know,

2385
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,960
different time zone. This is a [ __ ]

2386
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,800
crazy world. Yeah. And we're talking

2387
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,800
like and genetics can get there. Like

2388
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:08,320
it's going to be our genetics grown in

2389
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:11,119
their facility to our standards. someone

2390
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:14,000
in Australia, someone in Thailand,

2391
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:15,198
someone in Germany, someone in I mean

2392
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,679
people have been smoking our weed in

2393
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:20,158
Spain and UK for a long time, but these

2394
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:22,560
other countries I I think very little,

2395
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:23,920
you know, and that's [ __ ] that's

2396
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,840
something to be excited about. That's

2397
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,639
something to get up out of bed for,

2398
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:31,199
right? Is like I'm stoking someone out

2399
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,800
on the other side of the planet, right?

2400
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:34,559
you know, that doesn't even know who I

2401
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,360
am and they're smoking they're going to

2402
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,440
be smoking my weed and like having the

2403
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,519
best [ __ ] experience that they've

2404
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:44,238
ever had with me. It'll be like 2010 for

2405
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,280
them, you know, and and that 2010 those

2406
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:50,799
were magical years for cannabis like pre

2407
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:52,800
2010 to 201, you know, 18 even. Those

2408
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,560
were, you know, it was very nostalgic

2409
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,719
for for me like the early high times

2410
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,159
cannabis cups. People were excited and

2411
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,600
that's what I love about Spannabis going

2412
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,439
to events like Spanabis. I'm going to

2413
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,360
Mary Jane this year in June. I'll be

2414
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:04,719
there, too. It's going to be Yeah. Yeah.

2415
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,559
Yeah. Well, I'm going to be doing some

2416
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:09,439
live podcasts at the Grove booth with

2417
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,280
the Turp Lock guys. Yeah. So, yeah,

2418
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:12,559
we'll get you in on there and it's going

2419
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,519
to be a lot of fun. But that that

2420
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,360
reminds me of 2010 how it was here.

2421
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,719
People were excited for what's to come.

2422
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:20,479
We've already experienced and there's a

2423
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,800
lot of jade. Everybody's like, "Fuck, it

2424
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:24,158
was rough." Yeah. And uh you know, and

2425
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,800
they'll probably experience that, too.

2426
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:28,158
But I love the enthusiasm and they're

2427
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,639
just excited about wheat. They love

2428
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,479
weed. They love that. And it's the money

2429
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,920
hasn't come in come and gone and come

2430
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,678
and gone because we've experienced where

2431
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,279
it's like we're rocking and then next

2432
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,279
thing you know they're kicking us in in

2433
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,479
the dick. Next thing you know we're on

2434
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:42,000
top again and then they're they're

2435
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:45,359
knocking us down and cutting us off at

2436
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,198
the knees. And uh so and that's just I

2437
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:50,238
think that happens with most businesses.

2438
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:51,519
It's a cycle. Y and you just put it into

2439
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:54,319
great perspective and I just thought

2440
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,000
about that. We're just in a phase of our

2441
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:58,079
of the cycle that we've been going

2442
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,679
through. It just looks different every

2443
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:03,279
time because it

2444
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:06,239
feels that much stronger each time

2445
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:08,238
because it it's we have more invested

2446
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:09,919
now, more years of our life. We're older

2447
01:27:08,238 --> 01:27:11,519
than we were then and it feels

2448
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,079
different, but we're just going through

2449
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,000
a cycle and it's a down cycle and the

2450
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:18,158
next up cycle will be bigger than the

2451
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,520
last one. Yeah. And that's what we got

2452
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:23,119
to keep uh keep in front of us and these

2453
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,280
little bumps, these hurdles, no matter

2454
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:26,719
how painful they are. I think the other

2455
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:28,960
point you made earlier is the people

2456
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:31,279
that make it through this Yeah. you

2457
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:35,840
know, are going to really see the fruits

2458
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:38,399
of of what they swed over the years and

2459
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,719
all the hard uh hardship they've been

2460
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,319
through. So, I'm excited. Yeah. I I

2461
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:44,000
mean, yeah, the the horizon's still

2462
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:46,079
exciting and I just love being in here

2463
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,920
and watching this unfold and having

2464
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:51,039
guests like yourself on my podcast. This

2465
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,399
is why I do it. I love this experience

2466
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:54,238
for me. You know, I talk about

2467
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:57,439
experiences like this experience for me

2468
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,079
is just so gratifying where we have the

2469
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,439
opportunity to interview people like

2470
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:03,519
yourself and all these other people in

2471
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:05,839
the industry and hear their stories uh

2472
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,040
and like also see their un story the

2473
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,719
stories unfold and being able to get

2474
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:12,719
these names out there for some of these

2475
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:15,198
smaller people too. It's it's great to

2476
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,560
be able to give people a platform. So,
