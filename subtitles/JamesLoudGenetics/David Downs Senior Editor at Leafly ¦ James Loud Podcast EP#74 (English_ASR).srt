and staying on top of Trends uh and at

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,519
the time I was a freelance journalist I

37
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,158
had written for Wired and Rolling Stone

38
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,519
and the onion I had like a music and

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
Technology background and I was really

40
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,039
concerned like is this going to sabotage

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,280
my career and it went from being like

42
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,320
one file folder in a file cabinet to

43
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,960
being like my entire life I've written

44
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,398
three books and it's taken me all over

45
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,478
the world and we're still on it this

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,439
still day one pretty amazing well it's

47
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:54,158
so great because I feel like we're in

48
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,239
this amazingly beautiful time with with

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,079
cannabis and decriminalization it hasn't

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,078
happened yet but we are in this

51
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,279
beautiful place because we are the ones

52
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,679
as a collective group making all this

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,640
happen for sure and with the podcast

54
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,239
with the writing with the cultivating uh

55
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,839
you know we're we're on the shoulders of

56
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,120
some Giants that came before us that

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,120
were real cowboys and you know and

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,080
considered Outlaws and those people that

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,239
are were Outlaws I feel like they're

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
businessmen now doing the same thing

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,400
we're businessmen we have you know

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,640
entrepreneurs businessmen they didn't

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
call them those things back then they

64
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,039
were Outlaws yeah I think of Larry Jew

65
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,199
and he tells you to bet on yourself and

66
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,519
start a corporation and put your people

67
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,199
on payroll and pay your taxes and be

68
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,158
enterprising I feel like we're at this

69
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,598
era where they're passing the torch down

70
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,158
the boomers are finally letting go of

71
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,079
the steering wheel or it's being Pride

72
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:49,598
out of their hands and the next

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
generation of culture keepers are coming

74
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,318
up underneath them and they're really

75
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,479
enterprising they're using all the tools

76
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,679
available to them and it's great to see

77
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,919
so many of them kind of just run wide

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
open in a time when they're really

79
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,878
needed it's very much Golden Era of

80
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,199
cannabis with the genetics yeah um and

81
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,840
then every day new markets are coming

82
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,079
online uh I get to tell good news

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,920
stories to people every day and spread

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,480
this literal gospel Ohio just launched

85
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,318
Florida's got adult use on the ballot

86
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,238
right um South Dakota I think might have

87
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:22,079
to vote on it again and we see all that

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,480
new interest and new people coming in

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,560
every day at lefley and it's very uh

90
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,399
energizing yeah well and I think a lot

91
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,920
of people you know the C cators and

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,519
stuff like that there some people are

93
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,878
down in their luck and there are tough

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,680
times at the same time but there still

95
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:41,759
is the beautiful side of the story and I

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,480
I love both sides I think you can't have

97
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,479
one without the other it's the yin and

98
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,039
yang the balance uh and whenever you

99
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,518
move into a market like this there's

100
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,759
going to be a time where it's not stable

101
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,280
which is going on especially in the

102
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,840
California market right now it's not

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,400
very stable and there's upcoming markets

104
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
like Florida which really excites me New

105
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,000
York which is kind of a [ __ ] show but

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,719
still really impressive yeah um it's uh

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the best of times and worst of times it

108
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,199
just depends on which grow you're talk

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,680
to we did SF weed week in April and SF

110
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,599
hash week in July and these are these

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,759
big uh series of events to honor the

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,360
Cannabis culture in the Bay Area yeah

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,680
and we consistently talked to people who

114
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,520
are adding lights really excited about

115
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,519
the future adding buildings uh getting

116
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,319
like selling out um like they can't put

117
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,359
it on um their wholesale uh websites

118
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,319
fast enough and it's being scooped up at

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,038
the same time you hear people who are

120
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,918
having a really tough go of it they've

121
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,759
gave it their all they put all their

122
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,560
final dollars on it they still had some

123
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,479
tough breaks or just the taxes are bad

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,879
the regulations are bad and they're

125
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,519
really suffering and it's tempting to

126
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,000
think that that experience is globalized

127
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,120
but you have to remember that the people

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,279
who are doing well are kind of quietly

129
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,240
doing well um because it's kind of go to

130
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,839
say to someone who's suffering well like

131
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,319
that's too bad for you we're we're

132
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,198
rocking it out over here yeah and so I

133
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,519
do see all of it and we're ultimately

134
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,520
going to just be in this era of price

135
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,038
compression and industrialization of

136
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,000
production um so you just have to like

137
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,360
deal with that reality but the good news

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,879
is that if you have good stuff we see it

139
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,720
still commanding top shelf prices you

140
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,639
just talked about $500 ounces right uh

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,759
you know around here that are still

142
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,199
being commanded even as you know we're

143
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:35,038
hearing about the n dollar eth down in

144
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:39,199
SoCal yeah and I mean there's a handful

145
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:42,240
of guys really setting the bar for what

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,439
good cannabis is for what good quality

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,120
cannabis is uh you know I mean blueprint

148

00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,879
really trying to push the boundaries

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,919
with genetics trying to change it up a

159

keeps getting higher yeah um whether

166
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,960
it's because you got the cost per unit

167
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,120
down and it's still that AAA quality or

168
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,079
you found like a quadruple a quality

169
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,240
that nobody have seen before I must

170
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,399
smoke hundreds of strains a year between

171
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,598
judging cups and reviewing everything

172
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,439
for Leafly and I have never gotten like

173
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,598
bored or tired or thought I'd seen it

174
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,519
all Every Day brings a new thing across

175
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,120
my radar just this week it was connected

176
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:53,680
with their trop Z that just dropped

177
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,478
Cross of Zeno to granddaddy purple and

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Tom Hill Hayes a mix of new and old uh

179
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,240
where they were trying to go after a

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,599
sativa hybrid effect and revivify the

181
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,400
sativa space yeah I like that space yeah

182
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,120
not everybody does and I feel like a lot

183
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,679
of people steer away from it like when I

184
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,439
show them Super Silver Haze they're like

185
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,680
whoa that doesn't fit well into the

186
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,680
market and it's like maybe not your

187
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,759
Market but if you go up to Mendo or you

188
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,680
go up to Humble or you go somoma and you

189
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,038
talk to any of the ogs you show them

190
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,720
that they're like oh yeah I love this

191
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:27,719
stuff yeah we see uh traffic on Leaf Le

192
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,400
consistent high performance for a lot of

193
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,800
Legacy sativas hazes yeah so blue dream

194
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,918
is still a number one search St on the

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,280
west coast and it dropped down below

196
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,120
wedding cake for a minute but it's right

197
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,439
back on top there's a jack Mafia out

198
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,639
there that loves Jack I think you could

199
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,000
run like this is a free business idea

200
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,038
but you could run a jack Club in

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,199
California and have a mailing list of

202
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,079
like 5,000 fools who buy an ounce of

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
Jack every month if you could promise

204
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,519
them that it's top shelf Jack because

205
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,519
the good stuff kind of moves around a

206
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,839
bit it does well the Jack club's in

207
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,758
Oakland and they're breaking into cars

208
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,878
every day I know That's The Jacka club

209
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,479
or The Jacka Club but I I don't know the

210
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,199
trademark of being able to even use the

211
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:12,240
Jack Club but I I do see like the super

212
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,840
silver haze fans are di hard and um they

213
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,800
can't get enough of it I mean Flor and

214
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,519
Flame even has a good Super Silver Haze

215
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,478
that's the one yeah those are my so

216
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,079
Chris is one of my really good friends

217
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,839
uh that's some of his Donnie Burger

218
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:27,000
rosin right there which so I I see a lot

219
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,959
of rosin I'm judging the rosin category

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,519
for a change usually I judge flower but

221
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,158
they were like here's rosin and then we

222
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,000
didn't have time to switch I'm okay I'll

223
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,080
do rosin too every once in a while I

224
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,158
love judging flower because I'm super

225
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,839
critical over every last little detail

226
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,679
of it and I love compare like if you

227
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,880
give me 20 samples I'll put them in

228
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,159
order of what I think they are just from

229
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,120
the nose and then I'll go back and forth

230
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,199
between them for five or six days or

231
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,679
seven days I do that with all my own

232
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,839
stuff anyway right so with Ros and I

233
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,719
have the same kind of approach and there

234
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,920
was there's some Donnie Burger entries

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
that I've smoked over the years and then

236
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,719
there's the Flora flame Donnie Burger

237
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,360
which was harvested at the correct date

238
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,639
it has more of like a floral note it's

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,440
still really unique and you could tell

240
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:13,919
that it's related to GMO but it's its

241
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,600
own thing and I love Donnie Burger in

242
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,639
extract and I'm not a huge Donnie Burger

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,159
fan for flower shout out everything

244
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,838
coming off GMO right now it really is

245
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,120
holding its own and widening its Lane

246
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,640
Donnie Burger Han Solo Burger double

247
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,639
burger the burgers in general we're

248
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,720
telling people all over the country to

249
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,600
seek them out and find them and then

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,959
we're seeing them take home Awards and

251
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,440
uh yeah if they're done right they will

252
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,919
take home awards for sure I think I mean

253
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,040
I also like papaya sure you know I like

254
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,639
papaya I like white Thorn Rose sure so

255
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,078
and there's so many different good

256
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,399
things and it's so subjective to the

257
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,239
moment too we're going to put a thousand

258
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,639
strains in the LEF Leafly database this

259
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,759
year and it's not like a publicity stunt

260
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,720
or uh reach goal it's just the top 50

261
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,639
breeders 20 strains they put out this

262
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,360
year right that's a thousand right there

263
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,919
yeah and that's not even including

264
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,360
renames of something or a marketing push

265
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,159
from a brand that they're like oh we

266
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,159
took a Donny burger and we crossed it

267
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,480
and now it's like delicious burger and

268
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,439
we want to get delicious Burger in the

269
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,920
strain database if people are searching

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,680
for delicious Burger we're going to add

271
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:22,759
it yeah um and um but they're different

272
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:24,919
and the Spectrum keeps widening um we

273
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:28,159
are seeing Aromas that you know like the

274
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,479
white Thorn Rose Lane yeah um that is

275
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,439
really unique you had one back back

276
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,200
there that smelled like rose water

277
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,680
um I I I just wonder where it's going to

278
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,959
go next I'm excited well and really the

279
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,278
sky the limit we have so many guys

280
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,359
putting effort into breeding quality

281
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:45,639
genetics I think there there's a million

282
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,120
people doing it and then there's a

283
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,000
handful of people that are just killing

284
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,639
it and doing it the right way really

285
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,720
doing good feno hunts not just making

286
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,278
seeds you know and really the breeding

287
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,800
side of it it's all about the feno hunt

288
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,958
it's all about finding something new

289
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,000
that's where you should get the

290
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,199
enjoyment from I mean it's fun seeds too

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,519
don't get me wrong but really that pheno

292
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,320
hunt is what makes you a good breeder or

293
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,879
not a good breeder it's just CU you can

294
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,278
get good genetics and make good seeds

295
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,439
doesn't mean you're a great breeder it's

296
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,759
the guys that are really doing the R&amp;D

297
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,600
and spending the time with the plants

298
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,480
and putting the hours in I want to see

299
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,360
them surface that too I want to know

300
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
more about the story behind what they're

301
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,519
bringing to Market yeah so much of what

302
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,838
I'll see especially from overseas a lot

303
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,320
of time we feel like the the Providence

304
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,040
is opaque I'm like where the [ __ ] did

305
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,639
this come from what did you cross it

306
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,639
with where did you grow it who's your

307
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,240
grower where are your facilities and

308
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,399
they often times can't tell you that

309
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,120
because they legality yeah um and they

310
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,278
used to have all the Mojo over there but

311
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,078
now under the farm bill we can the we

312
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:47,519
can move quick here and in the daylight

313
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:49,159
and the top breeders the ones that won

314
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,679
the awards when you go to them they can

315
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,838
tell you exactly what they did and how

316
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,838
they did it and they they're really

317
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,240
transparent um it's they are transparent

318
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,160
but the one thing I feel needs work is

319
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,959
is we need fingerprinting where where we

320
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,199
can submit samples to my flora DNA or

321
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,719
whoever it is that has a database where

322
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,879
we can compare and it's from the breeder

323
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,839
and it says this is my [ __ ] and because

324
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,720
there's so much renaming going on and

325
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,120
people are breeding with cuts I have

326
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
Skittles and I made a cross with

327
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,399
Skittles but it was really lemon tree or

328
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,759
it was really this or it was really

329
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,320
that yeah I mean it's it's wild it's a

330
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,679
wild west time it's wide open um one

331
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,399
thing I'm thinking about more is how to

332
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,000
as quality by cosign like a lot of times

333
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,919
it comes down to reputation like who

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
will [ __ ] with you who likes you and so

335
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:42,479
um we gave archive seeds uh strain of

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the year for Dosey Do and um it was kind

337
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,440
of a Miss in the audience but I still

338
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,360
[ __ ] with archive Fletch uh I grow his

339
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,720
stuff I've grown his uh Dosey tree and

340
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,560
grew an actual lemon tree size Tree in

341
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,278
my backyard in one year so have you had

342
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,759
the moonbo ex I have had it I haven't

343
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,919
grown it yet so from Flor of flame they

344
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,439
have the

345
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,919
that just did just harvested some I was

346
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,040
he didn't tell me it was the he told me

347
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:10,000
it was MBO 112 but it's moonbo

348
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:12,759
112 and I love that I love 112 as it is

349
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
I know Adam from archive up in Portland

350
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,000
and he hooks me up with some amazing

351
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
flower and that's one of the things I've

352
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,759
gotten from him that I just love and the

353
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,278
exx from Flor of flame is amazing I

354
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,720
believe it um I was you know we gave uh

355
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,120
strain of the year to permanent marker

356
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,800
last year went down and saw see junkies

357
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,600
facilities you know we saw the flavors

358
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,319
we tasted them we saw what was happening

359
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,839
in the market we saw who was winning

360
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,240
Awards they clearly have a lane that

361
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,839
they're digging down into and staying

362
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,399
even further ahead I just saw some new

363
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,800
zebra stripes that is growing out on the

364
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,039
market Cherry marker um I I I my

365
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,838
brother's growing a a permanent marker

366
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,039
cross in his backyard and it's beasting

367
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,600
out nice so it's um I feel like there's

368
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,198
more breeder names than ever and seeds

369
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,920
than ever and and yet our ability to

370
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,719
ascertain who's good and who's bad it's

371
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,278
it's a real it's an opportunity and a

372
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,720
challenge you know and so I'm thinking

373
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,198
about like how do we

374
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,079
surface breeder signs of quality like

375
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,159
what are the things you can as a

376
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,599
consumer ask about before you spend 18

377
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,278
pounds on three seeds yeah for something

378
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,159
that's essentially like a a Northern

379
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,120
Lights autoc cross that just kind of

380
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:26,439
watered down whatever came over from

381
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,240
America yeah you know well all of it's a

382
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,040
challenge I mean going to the dispensary

383
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,720
and finding good flower is a challenge

384
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:33,879
cuz packaging you know we I've talked

385
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,278
about on my show a lot I mean I can't

386
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,679
wait for us to be able to go to the

387
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,439
dispensary and they have jars and

388
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,719
Chopsticks I mean I think they have it

389
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,360
in Missouri now they do they have it in

390
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,160
Oregon they have deli style I love the

391
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
deli style you know stick your nose in

392
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,039
the jar you should be able to stick your

393
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,078
nose in the jar you know I mean and then

394
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,799
then the flower speaks for itself right

395
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,958
and I love that I love I want to work

396
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,399
with um a Californians on bringing back

397
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,239
deli style or smell jars I was talking

398
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,159
to one Club that was like how do we get

399
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,639
the smell going and I was like because

400
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,838
they always complain about the cost of

401
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,440
burning a jar you know for smell sure

402
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,680
and they're like our margins are so low

403
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,440
we can't afford to put out a smell jar

404
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,278
and I'm like well maybe the opposite

405
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,639
maybe you can't afford to not put out a

406
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,958
smell jar because to me the smell it

407
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,560
makes the sale right like imagine going

408
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,000
to a banana stand they're like you can't

409
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,078
see the bananas you can't touch the

410
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,399
bananas you can't smell the bananas but

411
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,039
you can see the packaging the bananas

412
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,278
are $60 yeah I wouldn't buy any [ __ ]

413
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,679
bananas I would go find a guy who had

414
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,399
bananas and I could like see if I wanted

415
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,559
a banana totally and it's just

416
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,399
overregulation it's too much it's dumb a

417
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,278
shout out the Artistry in West Hollywood

418
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,159
they got those little boxes on chains

419
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,278
with this poofy squishy corner and so

420
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,278
you can smell something that's where I

421
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,159
picked up some per markers cookies has

422
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,278
the jars with the perforated holes on

423
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,879
them and you can smell and I think

424
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,318
that's it's okay but it we really need

425
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,759
the deli style to come back I feel like

426
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:02,039
there's just something about chopsticks

427
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,480
too that I love I know you they still

428
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,799
regulate it like it's plutonium yeah you

429
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,360
know instead of an herb in the places

430
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,679
we're regulating it that don't need to

431
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,919
be regulated and then there's other

432
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,479
places like testing across the board

433
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,799
that I mean they're trying to make

434
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,519
improvements but there's no consistency

435
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,838
that needs to be run by the state a lot

436
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,039
better uh or run by the federal

437
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,639
government eventually and there's a lot

438
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,399
of people are saying they want less

439
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,360
regulations well I want less regulations

440
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,440
too but when it comes to testing I think

441
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,680
we need to have something that's stable

442
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,880
across the board where people know that

443
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:37,318
you know this this 22% is really 22% and

444
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,360
if I go somewhere else it says 22% even

445
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:40,198
though it doesn't tell the whole story

446
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
it's

447
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,679
still a determining factor and it will

448
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,759
still tell you somewhat of how the

449
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:51,758
effect is we're seeing California CR CL

450
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,959
clamp down on THC inflation yeah um and

451
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,879
but behind that is um whether or not

452
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:00,000
those like pesticide tests are accurate

453
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,000
um or and then what pesticides they

454
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,599
aren't testing for way back in 2019 in

455
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,640
the before times we had a rash of lung

456
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,958
injuries across the country from people

457
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,759
putting Vitamin E oil in pens and

458
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,480
popcorn lung yeah we got to the bottom

459
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,400
of that and we kept reporting on it and

460
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,240
we came to the conclusion that like back

461
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
four or five years ago now that like

462
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,318
we're going to need random endpoint

463
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,519
testing and then like a random like on

464
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:32,079
uh property testing just to make sure

465
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:35,119
you're not using one of the 500 exotic

466
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,480
pesticides that can't be in the panel

467
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,479
that they normally test for the 64

468
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,319
pesticide panel yeah because I mean

469
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,400
those might be like The Usual Suspects

470
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:45,678
but that just automatically pushes

471
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,240
people to the Exotic weird pesticides to

472
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,000
get around that 64 panel for sure and um

473
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,120
we haven't seen that done here some

474
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,440
states like Washington affirmatively

475
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,719
like list a bunch of pesticides that

476
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,558
they are okay with you spraying I've

477
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,640
never seen EPA data is showing you can

478
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:05,639
burn that stuff and inhale it and and

479
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,559
like it's all gr groovy right um and the

480
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,159
one upside we've seen lately is that um

481
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,839
there are now thirdparty certifications

482
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,120
and third party labels for people who

483
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,000
want to affirm that they are we swear to

484
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,000
God we're not using any pesticides come

485
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,038
inspect us yeah come inspect our end

486
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,759
product do it anytime you want we'll pay

487
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:27,079
you and so you see the like um the oal

488
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,079
certified yeah or it's like it stands

489
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,000
for you can't use the word organic the

490
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:33,279
FDA but you can apply all those

491
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,240
standards and and and the voters ask the

492
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,279
state to come up with oal and so now

493
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,000
we're seeing oal pot come out and then

494
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,200
Jetty I think Jetty has it on their

495
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,759
cards the the I love that you can get

496
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
oal dabs Y and if you really really

497
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,440
really can't be exposed to any

498
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,519
pesticides at all for a health reason

499
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,038
you can shop oal now yeah and then we

500
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,798
have Sun and Earth certified as well and

501
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:57,119
they also claim that they are their

502
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,798
their ban pesticides list isn't 64 like

503
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,119
the state it's like 250 yeah and you're

504
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:04,119
going to be jumping through those hoops

505
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,678
and so that's optimistic to me because

506
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,359
that's the free market and people

507
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,679
choosing and voting with their dollars

508
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,240
for better versus more government right

509
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,840
but that the missing piece is still

510
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,159
people making that choice and knowing

511
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,158
the choic is available right well and I

512
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,520
think it's really important with

513
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,280
concentrates because it is a

514
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,639
concentrated version so you are

515
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,480
concentrating those

516
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,960
chemicals uh just my two cents on it

517
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,798
yeah but it's like man if you're smoking

518
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,079
concentrates you want it as clean as

519
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:35,359
possible yeah 100% and uh I mean I'm

520
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,240
from the medical era like I'm sure we

521
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,479
smoke some pesticides for sure and I

522
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,200
made bu for Ed Rosenthal in 2014 and

523
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,640
they were open blasting and I was hiding

524
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,360
behind a tree with a notepad while the

525
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,559
filter got jammed up and they're in they

526
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,158
banging on it you know and uh like yeah

527
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,399
they were concentrating some sketchy

528
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,320
stuff and then when you concentrate it

529
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,480
and burn it some of the like things it

530
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,399
turns into when you burn it are really

531
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,360
really not cool like basically akin to

532
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,200
like mustard gas yeah and so like people

533
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,000
are like well how much mustard gas and

534
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm like can I have none how about none

535
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,640
zero I'm in the mood for zero right yeah

536
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,720
I mean and that's where you know it's

537
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,840
like we don't have a lot of long-term

538
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,360
data on the effects of these things

539
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,639
either so we will eventually yeah I feel

540
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,798
like we're getting down this weird Lane

541
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,799
where like bro I legalized weed I want

542
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,720
to smoke weed I didn't legalize shark

543
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:34,599
liver oil in my lungs like if you want

544
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,679
to go put shark liver oil in my lungs

545
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:40,199
which is a vitamin E acetate you know

546
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,720
analog go to the FDA prove it it's safe

547
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,038
we need to treat it like to a degree we

548
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,839
need to treat it like medicine even if

549
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:47,720
it's being used recreational yeah I mean

550
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,480
for me legalization was like telling the

551
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,440
FDA sit down about marijuana we got this

552
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,798
yeah but I it was the marijuana the

553
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Canabis not like additives fillers

554
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,400
dilutant

555
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,759
thickeners uh there's a lot of other

556
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,759
stuff that are not cannabis that I did

557
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,480
not legalize when I legalized it right

558
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,839
and well we have this really amazing

559
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,360
opportunity to make the world a better

560
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:13,439
place and that takes away from that

561
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,879
opportunity uh you know with with

562
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,278
cannabis and with legalization we can

563
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,360
make the world a better place cannabis

564
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,440
by itself makes the world a better place

565
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,759
my Uber driver uh headed to West

566
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,038
Hollywood her husband back surgeries

567
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,359
from football college or High School in

568
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,278
permanent pain on opio oids the the wife

569
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,959
was like man I'm losing my husband to

570
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,359
opioids and she doesn't even smoked

571
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,120
she's straight but she knows that

572
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:41,119
there's like canabo Alternatives yeah

573
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:43,798
and so he was super anti but she got him

574
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,479
on it and now he has pain control he has

575
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:49,519
quality of life he has sleep he has uh

576
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,558
he's eating right his mental attitude is

577
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,278
better he's he's a happy like functional

578
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,918
pothead now and she you know just is

579
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:58,759
driving me to this uh party where we're

580
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,799
going to go celebrate the adult you side

581
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,519
of it but um the the medical side of it

582
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:05,839
is the other side of the coin and it's

583
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,839
always right there and it's like my

584
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,240
career is a career of people walking up

585
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,558
to me and saying like thanks for writing

586
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,159
about this cannabis gave me my life back

587
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,839
yeah you know for all these all these

588
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,278
ailments totally spooky it is it's it's

589
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,959
really wild and you know it's subjective

590
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,919
to the individual and I feel like

591
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,038
there's so many uses for it and it works

592
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,120
differently because we all have

593
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:31,319
different body chemistries but there are

594
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,519
profound medical benefits that we've

595
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,000
seen especially with children in

596
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:38,359
seizures 40% reduction rate how can you

597
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,400
argue with that yeah like uh the these

598
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,199
kids were dying of incurable seizures

599
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,840
they were going to die and then you gave

600
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
them a plant oil extract and four and 10

601
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,879
stopped having seizures yeah just

602
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:54,000
stopped and then the other s like six

603
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,880
had less and the side effects were way

604
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,679
better than the other stuff I as a

605
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,200
parent I would move anywhere in the

606
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,640
world to get access to that kind of

607
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,600
seizure control yeah and we're still

608
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,720
kind of at day one like I know what

609
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,759
we're looking into now is canabo for

610
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,319
other mental health issues like

611
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,640
schizophrenia bipolar and stuff I think

612
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,319
are like the rest of our lives will be

613
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,840
dominated by new cannabinoid therapies

614
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,918
well Doug drug Discovery through

615
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,319
cannabis yeah you know and plant

616
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,200
medicine and I think plant medicine can

617
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,359
be so vast too so we're going to start

618
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,720
with cannabis and then they're really

619
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,519
going to dive into other whole plan

620
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,038
extractions I mean we had a guest a

621
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,639
couple weeks ago that was talking about

622
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,759
uh thcv and seek okay you know what I

623
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,038
mean so like there's other things out

624
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,200
there that we really haven't fully

625
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,038
explored and that's just a whole another

626
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,519
Lane and I think that's really exciting

627
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,640
that's exciting for me yeah I mean there

628
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,480
when the cost per unit of cannaboids is

629
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,919
cents on the dollar and it's legal

630
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,400
you're going to see it in a lot of

631
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,679
Cosmetics yeah there's like uh you can

632
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,480
control acne or it control inflamation

633
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:07,278
absolutely yeah or um like neuralgia

634
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,839
like pain yeah um and uh it's just so

635
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,679
sad how many people had to suffer for so

636
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,879
long for no good reason to get to this

637
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,360
point where we're like you know we've

638
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,760
had enough of the Controlled Substances

639
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,479
Act in this kind of regime that we've

640
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,400
been going about it it was for a really

641
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,159
bad reason yeah really bad reason for a

642
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,360
handful of individuals that basically

643
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,520
wanted to take advantage of the system

644
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,278
yeah yeah um I'm so happy people stood

645
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,558
up and expressed their right to vote and

646
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,880
we had de direct democracy we had enough

647
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,839
data in as a pol as people to be like

648
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,520
we're going a different way there's lots

649
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,439
of states that don't have the referendum

650
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,639
process and they can't just stand up and

651
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,000
vote and I mean even in Florida you got

652
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,880
to get to 2/3 it's not majority rules

653
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,759
weeds legal it's 2third majority rules

654
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,960
weeds legal and they're they're close to

655
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,879
getting there they're like right on the

656
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,840
cusp of getting like 60 something

657
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,278
pretty wild well I mean medical PS in

658
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,798
the 90s per. like clean water doesn't

659
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:12,558
pull at 90% no um and then adult use

660
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:15,798
polls in the 60s like high 60s and um

661
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,398
it's uh a different era than even 12

662
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:20,798
years ago so Leafly for example came of

663
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:22,359
age in a time when people were afraid of

664
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,918
their boss looking over their shoulder

665
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,479
at them looking up weed on a site so

666
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,120
they were always really button down in

667
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,919
Demir and calming Demir about um what

668
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:36,119
was going on and now that kind of reeks

669
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,559
of um trying to be a monom minority or

670
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,839
trying or like respectability politics

671
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,038
and in reality pot has 66% of the vote

672
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,158
medical pot has 90% of the vote we don't

673
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:50,359
have to justify ourselves to anyone our

674
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,919
culture is just as valid as it is today

675
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,639
it doesn't need to put on a suit it

676
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,960
doesn't need to like speak a special

677
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,440
language it has a right to exist on its

678
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,079
own and the majority of people in the

679
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,440
country think that and

680
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,918
um dville talks in the 1850s about the

681
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,600
power of the majority will the second

682
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,720
the majority of an Americans think

683
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,199
something if you're not in that majority

684
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,519
you're out in the political Wilderness

685
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,038
you're like you just don't have any

686
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:15,798
power and so cannabis W and cannabis

687
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,158
people one we have nothing to be ashamed

688
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:19,679
of we have nothing to apologize for and

689
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,559
we don't have to change for anyone yeah

690
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,278
and I mean it's just becoming more

691
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:28,639
normal by the day you know especially

692
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:30,599
compared to the 70s 80s and 90s

693
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,960
uh you know in the 2000s it started

694
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,519
gaining popularity and then there was

695
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,798
this beautiful time you know like with

696
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:40,079
the early High Times cannabis cups in

697
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,158
the US where it was the the the vibe

698
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,960
there was like disco it'll never be the

699
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,960
same I'm seeing it in places like colia

700
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,440
in Mexico in Germany and you know Spain

701
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,840
still has that kind of 2010 vibe in the

702
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,840
US where people are they haven't been

703
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,240
jaded yet it hasn't been fully

704
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,639
commercialized yet and they love the

705
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,159
plant and you know it's so exciting I'm

706
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,200
going to Mexico October uh the beginning

707
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,000
of October for La traner canaba oh my

708
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,038
God and so I'll be speaking out there at

709
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,759
the event I'm giving seeds out again I

710
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,519
did it two years ago we gave it a ton of

711
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:17,359
free seeds and there is free seed day

712
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,879
Masonic is doing his free seed day thing

713
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,319
now brilliant yeah and I mean these are

714
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,000
the people that deserve it these are the

715
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,798
people that probably can't afford the

716
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,720
good genetics and to have breeders give

717
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,398
out genetics that are quality and put

718
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,399
those genetics in the hands of the

719
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:34,479
people down there I mean it's just it

720
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:37,519
reminds me of 2010 and what I love about

721
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,278
cannabis so much yeah it's shocking to

722
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:43,519
see the plant go so full circle because

723
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:45,278
I mean again back in the 1800s in Mexico

724
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,558
City there were selling weed out of

725
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,880
stalls the these women were called

726
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,079
cettas like the curers you know um witch

727
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120
doctory women but they were plant

728
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:57,038
medicine plant you know they were using

729
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,678
plant medicine and they were doing it

730
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,720
because they had IND

731
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,640
knowledge around how powerful plants

732
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,278
were and when um the Explorers showed up

733
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,320
with hemp they took it into their

734
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,798
pharmacopia found out all this medical

735
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,158
properties and made it their own was

736
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,759
like selling it back and so the first

737
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,360
Reefer Madness starts with like Mexico

738
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,079
City you know weed stalls being like can

739
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,398
we even have these these chicks are out

740
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,319
here fing weed and the AP you know

741
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,119
Associated Press is like sending stories

742
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,439
back to be able to bring refined

743
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,839
cannabis seeds marijuana seeds back to

744
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,120
Mexico and have them plant what we

745
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:35,558
worked on up here uh is just so poetic

746
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,798
and perfect you know yeah I mean I made

747
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:41,200
a cross specifically for them that was a

748
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:43,079
gelato times Mexican Haze okay and so I

749
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
have some of that here I'll show you

750
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,960
it's got the haze nose like but it also

751
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,399
you could tell it's gelato it looks like

752
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,038
gelato it smokes like gelato with Haze

753
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:56,079
but it's more of that energetic kind of

754
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,759
high it's not like super silver uh it's

755
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:02,240
more of a hybrid but it still has like

756
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:05,240
an energetic to it uh you know it's

757
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,839
um it's Unique it's Unique and it's fun

758
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,679
that's what like I feel like whenever

759
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:11,199
you go do things like that you are

760
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:13,880
tapping into being of service of the

761
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,038
plant and not to get spiritual or spooky

762
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,720
but things go better for you when you

763
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,278
align yourself with what the plant wants

764
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,519
to do well at the end of the day we're

765
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:24,558
all just stewards of the plant it's not

766
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:27,880
our plant we're just here

767
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,918
to add add some part of ourselves to it

768
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,240
and to its Legacy because it has its own

769
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,679
legacy right and so we have our Legacy

770
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,679
but our job as stewards is just to in

771
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,360
part part of ourselves into it to move

772
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,240
the plant along so other people can do

773
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,839
the same you know we don't we don't own

774
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,558
it even though it feels like I own these

775
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,119
genetics I made this well man we're

776
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,798
working on the backs of the guys in the

777
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:54,119
60s and 70s and there you know even 50s

778
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:55,240
60s and 70s and the the explorers and

779
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,359
the guys that went out and got those

780
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:03,720
seeds from Afghanistan Colombia IA all

781
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:05,798
over India you name it and you know this

782
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,558
plant's been in existence forever you

783
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:10,079
know at least 2,000 years in medicine

784
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:14,839
Chinese medicine even 3500 years yeah

785
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:16,519
3500 years and it's pretty amazing that

786
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,918
we've moved the plant to where it is now

787
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,000
and now we have all these different

788
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,278
flavors and I'm trying to take a refocus

789
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,038
into effect yeah where I kind of went

790
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,319
away and I was all about Flavor for the

791
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,599
last five years and really refocusing

792
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,000
myself back into the effect of the plant

793
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,719
and I think that's so important but it's

794
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,679
also recognizing without ego that we are

795
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,200
here for the plant and to move the plant

796
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,360
forward not the other way around yeah um

797
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,200
uh Michael paen in the botony of Desire

798
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,038
talks about four different plants that

799
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,038
got humans to do their bidding and

800
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:51,798
cannabis was one of them similar to like

801
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:54,158
dogs you know we think we domesticated

802
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:57,038
them but we've taken dogs all over the

803
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:00,480
world and the Cannabis Gene wants to

804
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:03,038
spread to every biome in the globe and

805
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,278
uh it did not have anything going on in

806
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,038
the Americas as best as we know we know

807
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,798
until the Spanish explorers brought the

808
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:12,879
hemp over but the second it landed like

809
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:15,038
it just colonized the whole continent

810
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,399
and now you have a lasting Thunder [ __ ]

811
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,158
all the way down to probably some like

812
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,359
Chilean tier del fuego fuego totally and

813
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,080
then we got Jamaica we got islands with

814
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,839
cannabis you know Hawaii's got their

815
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,000
thing going on they've been doing it for

816
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:29,278
quite a while uh you know and all the

817
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,240
you know the slaves that did bring the

818
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,798
stuff to Jamaica yeah and um it's called

819
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,919
the Colombian Exchange this idea of like

820
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:41,638
old and new mixing so potatoes went from

821
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:45,679
Peru to Ireland tot Tomatoes went from

822
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:48,918
here to Italy cannabis came from over um

823
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:52,000
and we've spent the last you know 500

824
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,440
years mixing Global genomes and were not

825
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,798
done the plant's not done with us doing

826
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,880
its bidding no you know no and it's

827
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,158
something that we were meant to consume

828
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,960
we wouldn't have these receptors in our

829
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,000
bodies if we weren't meant to consume it

830
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,600
um and it wouldn't make us healthier I

831
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,720
don't think uh but yeah we have all

832
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:13,119
these receptor sites and we're just

833
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,639
scratching the surface of the medical

834
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,479
side of it which I love the fact that

835
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:21,439
we're still pushing it forward and we're

836
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,000
still in this golden era in certain ways

837
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,880
you know I feel like maybe maybe people

838
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,638
consider the Golden Era that you know

839
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,080
pre what we're at now but I feel like

840
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:32,359
with medicine in plant medicine and

841
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:35,278
Science and being able to use Ai and

842
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,839
computers to drive the breeding and I

843
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,798
mean I think the potential is just

844
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,480
really wild where we can go and now that

845
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,079
we understand sequencing a lot better uh

846
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,399
imagine 10 years from now when we can

847
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:48,398
really dial this stuff yeah and also

848
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:51,119
we're seeing the end of the single plant

849
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,879
single molecule single Target approach

850
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,918
to Medicine which is very useful we have

851
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,679
Penicillin and anything else but there

852
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,759
were some medicines that resist resisted

853
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,519
the single molecule single Target

854
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,960
Paradigm cannabis is one of them they

855
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,558
just threw their hands up and go well

856
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,159
it's an obage there's a lot of [ __ ] in

857
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:09,558
there works better when it's all

858
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,240
together yeah even

859
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:16,599
idx is has Entourage it's not just CBD

860
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,038
in an oil they found a way to

861
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:21,480
characterize it as like a whole plant

862
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,319
extract yeah so that like GW

863
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,399
pharmacutical knows you need the other

864
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:28,678
stuff in there even if they can't

865
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,959
validate the other stuff you know in

866
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,080
these eyes and the cool thing now is

867
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,679
like you can use big data and surveys

868
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,879
and come at it from the the other end

869
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,159
and been like when we gave this to a

870
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,880
million people and they all got back to

871
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,880
us and there's something here here

872
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,720
they're all reporting nause anti nausea

873
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,440
they're all reporting better sleep

874
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,839
they're all reporting less depression

875
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,000
less anxiety with Leafly the reviews we

876
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,638
get it's really clear if a strain is

877
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,960
more arousing than other strains yeah uh

878
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:57,158
wedding cake has really strong arousing

879
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,558
signals from our consumers like they are

880
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:02,559
smoking it and getting it on and logging

881
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,798
on and more than average you know cuz

882
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,678
people would say well any weed will make

883
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:10,519
you horny maybe but some cultivars some

884
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,519
chemo vars some chemo types are are a

885
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,599
standard deviation above the average and

886
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,759
there's like a list of them and so and

887
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,240
that like every effect can be come at

888
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,240
from like a big data point of view where

889
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,519
we can just set aside trying to find the

890
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,319
thing out of the whole mix that is doing

891
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,960
the thing we can just go well it's this

892
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,960
whole thing thing and when you give it

893
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,039
all like this thing kind of pops out of

894
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,599
the end and you can go spend the next

895
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,878
two generations figuring out what in

896
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,280
wedding cake is making people horny well

897
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,759
and I think the the bigger thing is is

898
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,639
like we have wedding cake and we can

899
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,760
figure that out but once you have 20

900
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,838
different things that have the same

901
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,879
effect then we can compare and we can

902
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:50,159
see where it's coming from and what part

903
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,398
of the plant

904
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,679
canabo uh Turpin or flavorant you know I

905
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,279
think THS have now been renamed I mean

906
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,480
they're still THS but they 've also been

907
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,839
renamed flavorants you know if we're

908
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,280
talking about sulfur in the plants yeah

909
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:07,159
volatile sulfur compounds now absolutely

910
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,960
I mean abstracts Tech wrote those white

911
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,118
papers and kind of changed the game

912
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,760
thank you I'm glad they did yeah I mean

913
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,559
we need people like that we need people

914
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,640
pushing it forward and especially you

915
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,920
know using their minds and doing it the

916
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:23,118
right way to

917
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,838
where some of these studies are funded

918
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,119
by companies some have you know I feel

919
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:28,759
like some of these people are just

920
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,720
saying stuff to say stuff and you can

921
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,880
really get supporting data from almost

922
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,838
anything I mean like they genuinely

923
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,200
those guys genuinely love [ __ ] weed

924
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:38,199
yeah and I think that's important

925
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,399
because we had this era where like

926
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:42,000
people like it's all the THC and then we

927
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,079
we like found tping we're like it's all

928
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,639
the tpping right but even at Leafly

929
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,839
you'd see things the same top three

930
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:50,719
turpins that were just different right

931
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,400
and you're like I smoke all this weed

932
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,318
and you're telling me these two things

933
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,240
are the same cuz the top three turps are

934
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,838
the same and I'm telling you they're not

935
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,399
the same you're going to have to keep

936
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,039
going and abstracts did keep going and

937
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,680
they found some stuff that's at the part

938
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,920
per million level at the part per

939
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,879
billion level smaller molecule but they

940
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,200
have outsize effects which is so obvious

941
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,800
to me that like just like not all

942
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:17,399
molecules are created equal they don't

943
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,160
all have the same sized effects like

944
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,119
right one molecule can have an A

945
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:24,239
Thousand Times action at a receptor than

946
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,400
a different molecule and so weight just

947
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,719
weighting them in sheer amounts doesn't

948
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,680
get at the whole story it's like a guide

949
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:34,118
poost but you have to have be humble and

950
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,440
hold space for like what we still don't

951
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,800
know right and I mean I think a lot of

952
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,800
us just contributed Citrus to lying and

953
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
they provve that's wrong you know it's

954
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,480
like stuff like that and there's or the

955
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,119
amount of loning right like one a little

956
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,960
can do smell like one thing and a lot

957
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,079
can smell like another and then when you

958
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,240
add three other things at other levels

959
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,960
and then all the things you can't

960
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,879
measure you end up having a kind of

961
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,079
default to be like man trust your nose

962
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,960
trust what you like Trust gives you a

963
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,280
good experience I I it's so simple you

964
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,920
know when we're trying to get that be

965
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,040
simple for our audience and not

966
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,639
overwhelm them or make them feel dumb

967
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,599
and so I'm so proud to be able to go

968
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:11,559
back to the audience and be like just

969
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,119
smell weed and smoke what you like for a

970
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:15,318
while and maybe write it down or check

971

know they smell a chem and they're like

974
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:23,000
ah I remember getting a panic attack

975
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,039
from that smell yeah and they're like no

976
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,079
and good don't hit that yeah even if it

977
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:32,079
has uh chemotype that someone said is

978
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,480
like exactly what you need no like smoke

979
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,800
something else you smell a lavender and

980
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,159
you're like oh this smells like my

981
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,079
favorite girlfriend from freaking

982
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:43,000
freshman year like try that mom's

983
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:45,560
perfume or whatever it is yeah um and

984
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,838
trust your nose I you know as far as I

985
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:50,440
know the sense of smell is the first

986
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:52,599
sense to to develop like in the womb

987
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,400
yeah and then um it's the strongest

988
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:57,039
memory trigger so they will use smells

989
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,280
in memory care facilities with people at

990
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,079
dementia Alzheimer's to help like bring

991
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,760
them back to a moment or bring them back

992
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,560
to reality wow and uh I know like I

993
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,119
could visit a room I hadn't been in in

994
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,679
20 years with my eyes closed and I could

995
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,599
smell that room like a basement or

996
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:12,719
something I know exactly where I am

997
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,359
absolutely and I think weeds like that

998
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,519
too and we think it's probably because

999
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,480
our sense of smell of volatiles in the

1000
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,039
environment kept us alive yeah like you

1001
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,719
needed to eat the right thing or if you

1002
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:27,039
ate the wrong bitter Berry you died if

1003
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:30,239
uh you did dis acknowledge the animal

1004
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,960
that was stinky or like a skunk yeah you

1005
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:36,000
maybe didn't pass on your jeans and um

1006
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,240
and I think I I have a little bit more

1007
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,599
uh heart for people that say I don't

1008
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,519
like the smell of weed it smells like

1009
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,559
skunk I think what they're trying to say

1010
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,559
is that some lower part of their olymic

1011
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,039
system is afraid yeah like some part of

1012
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,838
them that they aren't even conscious

1013
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:51,880
enough as being like there is a [ __ ]

1014
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,078
skunk around here I don't want to get

1015
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,480
sprayed cuz if you were a caveman and

1016
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,920
you got hit in the face with like a

1017
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,639
skunk you're going to have a bad day you

1018
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,920
might not even make it to the next day

1019
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,480
there was no ketchup back then there was

1020
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,720
no ketchup there was none of the things

1021
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,480
you could use to wash off that's the

1022
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,078
Cure by the way you get sprayed by a

1023
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,920
skunk or your dog does it's uh bathing

1024
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:14,280
and ketchup yeah but now like my dog

1025
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,318
gets partially skunked and I'm like

1026
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,359
smells like brake pads like someone's

1027
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:23,318
burning brakes or chronic what's going

1028
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:25,838
on I Honestly Love in small doses love

1029
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:28,039
that sprayed skunk smell and we we you

1030
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,239
know I think the new term is kill skunk

1031
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:31,679
or whatever but like we didn't we didn't

1032
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,358
have roadkill skunk when I was a kid we

1033
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,358
had skunk and we didn't even call it

1034
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,759
skunk we had you know but we had this

1035
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,838
strawberry we used to get from Santa

1036
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,160
Cruz that was skunkweed it was as skunky

1037
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:42,318
as it got but it was the shape the name

1038
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,159
they called it strawberry because it was

1039
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:48,159
strawberry shaped buds yeah yeah that

1040
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:50,159
[ __ ] is Stanky and awesome and uh I'm

1041
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,799
all about it the caropines in

1042
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,639
combination with some of those volatile

1043
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,280
sulfur nose burning sulfur oh yeah I

1044
00:39:54,639 --> 00:40:00,879
mean we had catpiss too that was like

1045
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:02,560
ammonia lost right for me it is I mean

1046
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,559
the thing is with cat pisses it's a

1047
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,599
description of an aroma and so my

1048
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:09,400
opinion is that there's 10 different

1049
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,760
people that had a cat piss and they were

1050
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,440
different cat pisses potentially and so

1051
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,920
their cat piss may still be around but

1052
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,200
the one that I remember that was like

1053
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,920
straight nose burning ammonia I have yet

1054
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:23,358
to see it but Dave from butero gave me

1055
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,920
some Sour Diesel when I was at reg on

1056
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:28,639
the river we became good friends after

1057
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,200
that uh and that Sour Diesel is the real

1058
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,318
cut and I've been looking for real Sour

1059
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,399
Diesel for a long time how did he keep

1060
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:37,920
it going he's had it for 21 years where

1061
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,800
how he's in mesino yeah I mean he's an

1062
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,240
amazing guy we're we're uh yeah we're

1063
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,400
talking about doing some fun projects

1064
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:47,598
together but he kept it alive and he

1065
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,079
didn't share it with a lot of people and

1066
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,000
I have some here to show you too and

1067
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,519
it's the real deal when you squeeze it

1068
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,119
if you know what sour smells like you'll

1069
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:55,599
be like yeah that's the real Sour it

1070
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,720
also makes me feel like there's only one

1071
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,720
real Sour um you know because I've seen

1072
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,159
so many different versions of stuff

1073
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,919
especially in the last year and a half

1074
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,920
two years that's really gassy that's not

1075
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,960
it I think there was one original sour

1076
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,358
and it came from like an original chem

1077
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,199
and it broke into OG and it's hard to

1078
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:17,960
hold on to because je jeans drift or you

1079
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,759
grow them bad or it gets sick and you

1080
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,159
kind of have to keep pulling the um

1081
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,520
crank on the slot machine and try to get

1082
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,399
three cherries again like I think the

1083
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,440
jeans to make sour are in there it's

1084
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,880
just like how can we resurrect them

1085
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,039
again like well so the next thing is for

1086
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,318
us to test it at my FL against sours

1087
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,279
that we already have and I have a

1088
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,480
feeling that there's some truth to what

1089
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,000
you're saying in regards that we may

1090
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,960
already have it but we're not able to

1091
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,480
make that plant Express like he's making

1092
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,159
it express to get the sour we have like

1093
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,838
seven different sours I think in tissue

1094
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:54,078
culture yeah and out of those seven I

1095
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,199
have yet to see one that expresses like

1096
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,280
his does where it's like oh yeah I feel

1097
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:02,039
home that sour you squeeze it you're

1098
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,839
like smells like early 2000s Sour Diesel

1099
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:07,239
what I love about Sour that it's it's

1100
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:09,599
citrusy it's not just gas it does have

1101
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,919
that gas it does have like that a little

1102
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,318
bit of that burnt Tire you know like

1103
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,880
latexy kind of like Strong gas but it

1104
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:20,759
has way more complexity because it has

1105
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,800
this this Citrus that that basically

1106
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,440
backs it up and this funk it's like a

1107
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,240
lime rind to me it is it is it's like a

1108
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,079
that's a good description versus like a

1109
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:34,919
a sweet like orange or orange juice or a

1110
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,920
lemon juice lemon juice or a lemon it's

1111
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,680
like lime rind or you know there's lime

1112
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,079
zest too right so there's lime I mean

1113
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:42,358
that's the thing about Citrus people

1114
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,160
think they categorize Citrus all in this

1115
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,358
one thing but really if we start

1116
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,960
breaking down the aroma of citrus what I

1117
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:50,078
love I always love talking about this

1118
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,000
because as a chef it's like there's so

1119
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,160
many different uses with Citrus you can

1120
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,838
use the juice you can basically make a

1121
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,039
candy version of that smell so like a

1122
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:04,639
orang candy or a lemon candy we can go

1123
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:06,558
into the zest we can go into the Rind

1124
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,799
cuz you know Tangi some of the tangis

1125
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:12,680
you get that Ry orange which I like and

1126
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,200
so there's 20 are different like the

1127
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:17,318
grapefruit like in a squirt strain yeah

1128

1142
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:52,199
awarded awarded cross for the longest

1143
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:54,439
time in that early High Times America

1144
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,558
cup it was winning every time DNA was

1145
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,720
getting on stage multiple times whether

1146
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,440
it was for

1147
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,719
the flour or the extract yeah you know I

1148
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,079
mean just killing it yeah I think like

1149
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:07,358
that's where it crosses over into

1150
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,280
fashion right um some turps are not

1151
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,960
fashionable the way some sneakers aren't

1152
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,079
like some of our followers will not be

1153
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,800
caught dead in A6 right they will not be

1154
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,760
caught dead smoking jack they can't

1155
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,640
afford to like hit to their social

1156
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,760
standing they think comes with it and

1157
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:21,960
then there's other people that don't

1158
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,720
give a [ __ ] they just do wear the shoes

1159
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,760
that make them feel comfortable or the

1160
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:29,239
strains they like um I just have to have

1161
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,000
respect in space for both I I've grown

1162
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:34,439
squirt multiple years from Humble seedco

1163
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,400
which is a Tangi back cross and it's the

1164
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,880
first one that my friends all take all

1165
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
of it like it's like because it actually

1166
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,240
smells like the soda squirt yeah and um

1167
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,318
I respect the pull like if your jar goes

1168
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:47,239
empty first that's the jar yeah that's

1169
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:48,639
the jar test that's what we do too we

1170
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:51,679
the jar test is I always like what's

1171
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,838
gone first right and so me I always have

1172
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,639
lots of jars and that's really my test

1173
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:58,480
too is like what did I gravitate towards

1174
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,960
the most because whatever's the best is

1175
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,119
usually what I smoke the first

1176
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,440
unfortunately yeah I might go for other

1177
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:07,440
stuff but I go for what the best stuff

1178
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,000
is like if I got some amazing Skittles I

1179
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,280
I might smoke through all that yes uh

1180
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,599
but if I have friends come over I might

1181
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,240
want to show them some other stuff too

1182
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,519
like I that super silver from Flor of

1183
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,199
flame you know that's a crowd favorite

1184
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:21,318
too I do you do the thing where you like

1185
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,118
have the house wine that you give out

1186
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,279
versus like the head stash so you're

1187
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,079
like you know let's save this for

1188
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,720
someone who really can appreciate it for

1189
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,640
sure for sure and then I you probably do

1190
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,879
the same thing we like I have if I

1191
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,759
finish a jar that's notable yeah cuz we

1192
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,079
have a lot of flour in our lives and we

1193
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,480
can pick and choose and so like if I

1194
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,318
actually get to the bottom of your jar

1195
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,559
wanted to smoke it all despite having a

1196
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,358
bunch of stuff like that goes on the

1197
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,359
like short list of like stuff I

1198
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,078
currently like you know yeah or if my

1199
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,400
friends are asking for something that I

1200
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,920
had like a month or two later you know

1201
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,880
and it's like it's been gone for a month

1202
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,559

it doesn't have to be black anymore he

1219
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,079
gone away from that but you need

1220

1222
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,639
it's one cross away from being good all

1223
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,640
these things are purple punch I dislike

1224
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:51,879
it it's one cross away from being

1225
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:53,920
amazing um need to put some Tangi in

1226

1228
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,440
lanes that I'm going down and basically

1229
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,399
what I'm creating is this big pallet

1230
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,519
that I can pick from uh because

1231
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,680
everybody likes different stuff

1232
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:09,159
depending on the area I do stuff with

1233
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:11,519
Cana Organics and with House of cultivar

1234
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:13,318

out to Jason Hutto he is one of the best

1238
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,280
feno hunters I've ever met in my life

1239
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:25,239
crazy job good friend yeah does does a

1240
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,559
crazy job um really good with the plant

1241
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:28,759
and also being able to grow it well

1242
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,319
enough to make it express which is the

1243
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,000
hardest part of the pheno hunting

1244
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,639
process you have to be a good grower if

1245
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,599
you're just growing them and you're

1246
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:37,039
they're not going to be that different

1247
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,680
but if you're actually putting the time

1248
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,920
in and you grow really good flour then

1249
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:43,399
it's like okay this out of 20 different

1250
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,760
seeds they're all slightly different you

1251
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,720
know and that's part of the magic I also

1252
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,839
am going into some wild stuff we got

1253
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:53,679
Fort Collins cough times banana Skittles

1254
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,199
okay we got Shoreline times banana

1255
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,598
Skittles I haven't released those yet

1256
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,719
but we're pheno hun a strawberry cough

1257
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,838
you know Fort Collins cough no the Fort

1258
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:05,399
Collins cough is the nl5 haze so kind of

1259
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:08,078
like the piff there's a there's a bunch

1260
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,960
of things you know nl5 Haze has been

1261
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,079
around there's a bunch of reiterations

1262
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,240
of nl5 haze Fort Collins cof is from

1263
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:19,039
Fort Collins uh Colorado and it is a

1264
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,479
spear looking apical dominant plant that

1265
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,199
shoots up and just you know the average

1266
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,159
plant grows like two inches a day this

1267
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,838
thing will grow four and it just keeps

1268
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:29,558
growing and you flip it into flower and

1269
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:32,719
just I had a 11 foot tall plant in my

1270
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:35,400
house when I was making seeds of it and

1271
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:38,078
it was like 4 feet wide 11t tall like a

1272
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,639
true Christmas tree like a true yeah it

1273
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,000
was like a what is it a not Scooby-Doo

1274
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,159
It's A Charlie Brown Christmas tree yeah

1275
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,239
uh I think with New York going legal the

1276
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,960
piff wave has really ticked up a notch

1277
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,078
people want to see piff they want to

1278
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,000
walk into a store and buy their old piff

1279
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,960
I got tissue culture we got the Cuban

1280
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,519
black and tissue culture we've got the

1281
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:01,639
Fort Collins we got a bunch of New York

1282
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:04,239
favorites uh but yeah the piff I think I

1283
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:06,279
I love the piff I love the piff because

1284
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,199
I'm a flavor guy I like the effect too

1285
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,359
because it's it's like a I wouldn't say

1286
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:12,960
it's a diet Haze but it's a more mellow

1287
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:14,558
Haze good and in a good way right where

1288
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,599
I can smoke a whole joint of it super

1289
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,760
silver I like sharing joints of it but

1290
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:19,400
if it's the middle of the day and I

1291
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,880
smoke a whole joint of super silver I

1292
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:25,079
may want to change my plans for the day

1293
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,599
whereas piff I can stay on task it keeps

1294
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,640
me kind of levelheaded uh if you smoke

1295
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,160
extract made from piff too which I I got

1296
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:34,159
to do it's it's super special too but

1297
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:37,159
like that was my workout one where I I

1298
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:40,078
just take we got this Little Dipper and

1299
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:42,199
I go lighter oh yeah I was just in New

1300
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,640
York and I rolled up a j of piff Haze at

1301
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,798
a legal store and smoked it and I won't

1302
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,759
tell where but I was not ready to go

1303
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:51,079
from like inside a basement smoking piff

1304
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,040
Haze to back onto the streets of

1305
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:56,000
Manhattan oh wow Chelsea you know like

1306
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,558
full sativa like heart palpitations like

1307
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,039
what the [ __ ] doing next like what was

1308
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,240
the plan like I have made a terrible

1309
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,759
mistake so piff is an interesting one

1310
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,279
because I feel if you harvested a little

1311
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,400
bit early it's a little more mellow and

1312
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,640
a little more floral and it's got its

1313
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,720
own thing going on flavor-wise yeah it

1314
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:15,358
does have that terpinolene lioning kind

1315
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,719
of hazes characteristic okay but it also

1316
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:20,239
has like this

1317
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:21,798
unique like it's it's almost floral

1318
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,719
incens

1319
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:26,199
and really good piff I feel like it

1320
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,919
burns down to the roach and it just

1321
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:29,399
tastes it tastes even better when you

1322
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,760
get down to the road it's like one of

1323
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,519
those ones it just keeps getting better

1324
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,359
and better and better in flavor do you

1325
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:36,159
think like some of these unworked

1326
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:38,480
genetics from 40 years ago can stand up

1327
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,960
to the new new cuz I see the development

1328
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,760
that's happened between the plant

1329
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,400
structure and the yield and how that

1330
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,960
grew versus like the hot rods of today I

1331
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,838
honestly think all this stuff so Dave

1332
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,599
from balero he's on a mission to bring

1333
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:57,960
back old and unique genetics and

1334
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,599
different stuff and he's going to do

1335
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,039
God's work and in ways that a lot of

1336
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,480
people wouldn't even understand but like

1337
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,400
to go in and Hunt through land race

1338
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,000
genetics it it takes a lot of work and

1339
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,920
it you're gonna get a lot of bad stuff

1340
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,119
to find the good stuff yeah um you'd be

1341
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,039
reselecting you're be you're reselecting

1342
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,680
you're doing a lot of the original work

1343
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,880
all over again that got us to the point

1344
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:24,318
where we're at and I love that it has a

1345
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,280
place he has some African Haze that's

1346
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:27,558
just super special right and I have some

1347
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,160
of that too and then he has some of

1348
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:33,400
these pearls from this this L race

1349
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:35,679
African that's just yeah it doesn't even

1350
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,480
smell amazing it looks terrible but the

1351
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,759
high from it just special and it lifts

1352
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,240
you up nice and gently for about 15

1353
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,400
minutes where it creeps up on you it's

1354
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:46,598
not like the creeper where you don't

1355
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,440
feel it you feel it but it keeps getting

1356
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:51,000
you more high for about 15 minutes and

1357
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,480
then you mellow off good and I

1358
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,880
really that's when I talk about going to

1359
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,480
back to breeding for effect it's like

1360
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,640
that that's what get me excited so now

1361
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,880
we have some different effects we've got

1362
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:05,400
the uh the white Thorn rose right so

1363
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,358
that is a fi I call that field good weed

1364
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:12,000
agree U and Dave that passed away

1365
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:15,480

00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:36,679
longest time and he did really well and

1375

he put on an amazing event and you know

1376
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:39,639
with Hempfest too like he's the one who

1377
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,960
got me to go to

1378
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:44,239
Hempfest um he took photographs of me

1379
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,358
when I was in high times for the first

1380
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,719
time yeah and so when I was in

1381
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:50,639
Publications he did that in 2012 after

1382
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,879
I'd won the cup in

1383
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:55,480
Amsterdam and really nice guy we became

1384
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,280
really good friends passed away on 420

1385
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,960
but he had the blue 1

1386
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,720
and that was blueberry Hayes times Louis

1387
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,358
the 13th from Kevin jrey that's gonna

1388
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:05,519
kill shout out to Kevin JRE shout out

1389
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,880
Kevin the same exact

1390
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,798
effect same exact as white Thorn Rose

1391
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,240
okay just from a different Vector just

1392
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:14,440
from a different Vector it's green white

1393
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,519
Thorn Rose is purple but they have the

1394
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,200
same makes you feel good like it was

1395
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,400
Eerie smoking them and kind of being one

1396
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:24,399
of the only

1397
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,280
people uh besides Carrie Boer from

1398
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,599
Montana who's a ganjier we had both had

1399
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,599
the experience that we met at Dave's

1400
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,079
memorial service and both of us had the

1401
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,838
same thing we realized we weren't crazy

1402
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,599
that we've got the same effect and

1403
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:40,400
that's kind of part of what made me want

1404
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:42,599
to breed for effect because that stuff

1405
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,880
is special and I feel like most people

1406
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,880
I'd say the average person in the United

1407
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,798
States maybe in the world if they were

1408
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,039
to experience that they would be like I

1409
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:55,239
really like wheat I really like cannabis

1410
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,400
because it makes you feel good it's not

1411
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:59,919
overly strong yeah it's not sedative

1412
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,240
it's not narcotic so it's neither one of

1413
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,798
these sides of the spectrum it's

1414
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,959
somewhere in the middle and it makes you

1415
00:54:02,798 --> 00:54:07,079
feel

1416
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,920
amazing and I feel like as a chef it's

1417
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,318
what I want to give people it's like

1418
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,159
this is what I want you to try because

1419
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,079
it makes you feel so good so even if

1420
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:15,480
you're a lightweight or you're somebody

1421
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,960
who doesn't really think you like

1422
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,440
cannabis but you're kind of curious

1423
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,480
about what your friends are doing that's

1424
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,639
the one and you know we we need a little

1425
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,318
bit more of that you know because we

1426
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:27,239
have so much of everything right so it's

1427
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:30,279
like we're in this world of instant

1428
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:33,798
gratification you there's 30 million

1429
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,160
gelato we have this handful of haze and

1430
00:54:33,798 --> 00:54:38,119
sativas blue dream I like blue dream we

1431
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,118
have Strawberry Cough you know I like

1432
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:42,599
Strawberry Cough too same I got a jar at

1433
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:45,400
home yeah Kyle came on the show gave me

1434
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:49,640
a jar and uh yeah we smok on it was

1435
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:52,000
really good um it's it's pretty strong

1436
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:53,759
right it's it's strong in a good way but

1437
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,079
yeah it's strong we smoked it on the

1438
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,440
show and it was like uh yeah it was good

1439
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:00,960
my favorite effect strain right now

1440
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,798
might be the Cana country 26 nice it's

1441
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,119
purple and it reminds me of an old AFU

1442
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:08,960
yeah or an AF goey I love old AF gooy

1443
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:11,440
and the old AF goey wasn't the turpi it

1444
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,519
was like a hash strain and but it was it

1445
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,480
was sweet on the nose but it was the

1446
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,400
most

1447
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:20,159
frostiest where you you look fake yeah

1448
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,440
and like it doesn't get super dense or

1449
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:25,318
chunky yeah like uh it's not checking

1450
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,440
some box but it's winning the race

1451
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:29,719
because of the effect where where I was

1452
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,798
like I have a dark rainbow at the house

1453
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:36,078
from uh Happy Trails and it's like a 37

1454
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:37,920
that smells and looks great but my God

1455
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,039
if I don't get a panic attack every time

1456
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,798
I smoke it so it's funny cuz coffin

1457
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,520
candy I feel like is 37% and as far as

1458
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:48,358
effect it's strong but it like makes my

1459
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,400
eyes super tight and it makes me just

1460
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:52,000
it's the

1461
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,240
narcotic right in a good way in a good

1462
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,679
way but like yeah those 37% or some of

1463
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,038
them can be like almost too much

1464
00:55:56,679 --> 00:55:59,598
sometimes yeah and like sometimes I want

1465
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:02,520
that I'm playing like hell divers too

1466
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,838
with my buddies and I like kids are

1467
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:07,280
asleep and I don't mind getting my pulse

1468
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:09,239
up or taking a mental inventory of like

1469
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,960
all my current enemies or whatever you

1470
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:13,279
know but like you're like like I'm

1471
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,159
wigging out and it's fine but in general

1472
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,960
I think people want Euphoria they don't

1473
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:18,798
want dysphoria they want to feel good

1474
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,480
they don't want to feel bad even the

1475
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,759
animal face can get right on top of a

1476
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,280
newbie that you have on the desk yeah I

1477
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,760
mean it's called animal face it's from

1478
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,920
Face Off OG like Fletch doesn't lie like

1479
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,720
it's a ripper yeah and but I mean it's

1480
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,639
something for everybody it's so

1481
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,399
subjective to the individual because

1482
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,798
sometimes people want that stimulant to

1483
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,119
calm them down yeah and sometimes people

1484
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:41,400
want that narcotic to make them feel

1485
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,440
normal you know it's it's so funny

1486
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,200
because it's so

1487
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,599
individualized and that's why doctors

1488
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:47,000
have such a hard time with it it's like

1489
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,559
they don't know what to recommend they

1490
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,519
tell someone they should try this and

1491
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,559
then you know there's no standard effect

1492
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,838
it's so complicated and for them to wrap

1493
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,559
their head around Plant medicine for the

1494
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,318
most part if they're in Western medicine

1495
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:02,039
it's really difficult I think that's how

1496
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:03,920
I discovered strains was the first one

1497
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,599
was for me was Blue Dream you know I was

1498
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,119
on the beat starting in ' 09 and I came

1499
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:10,359
into it definitely not believing that

1500
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:11,880
strains existed because I had go to your

1501
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:13,920
dealer and you'd have like two kinds

1502
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,599
right like lavender and OG yeah and you

1503
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,599
can you can take it or leave it you have

1504
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,798
it or what um but they said you know

1505
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,240
strains are a real thing they have

1506
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:25,480
different effects I'm like get out of

1507
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:27,279
here you know like go on and there bpcc

1508
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,639
had like actual strain cards back in the

1509
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,319
day totally uh baseball cards and blue

1510
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:33,558
dream was on one and it promised that

1511
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:35,239
50/50 hybrid effect and it you know

1512
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:38,599
people were using it for anti-anxiety

1513
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:41,558
and back then I definitely had anxiety

1514
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:43,880
yeah and I sought that out and it worked

1515
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:46,880
and I was like well son of a [ __ ] you

1516
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:50,358
know like this is my medicine for my

1517
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,519
anxiety those playing cards were awesome

1518
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:54,358
that yeah I mean yeah so Berkeley uh

1519
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:57,159
patients Care Collective off Telegraph

1520
00:57:54,358 --> 00:58:00,440
Avenue davidow uh yeah so there was Eric

1521

and Dave yeah and so yeah I mean people

1522
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,798
have heard my blue dream nightmare story

1523
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,720
like I called it the blue night like we

1524
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:07,679
still refer it it to as the blue

1525
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:11,159
nightmare because one year I had

1526
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:14,118
harvested a bunch and Eric and Dave had

1527
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:16,440
promised to buy five pounds of it okay

1528
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:18,358
and this is the year that blue dream got

1529
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,159
cultivated by everybody but it I grew

1530
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:21,719
the best Blue Dream at the time and my

1531
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,399
friends can all attest to it being the

1532
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,919
best it was sticky and it was chunky and

1533
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,358
the pounds of it you'd open it up and

1534
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,240
you be like wow this is amazing and blue

1535
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:32,880
dream's not hard strain to grow anyway

1536
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:35,919
it's very easy to grow it's so fun so

1537
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,720
come you know Christmas time I'm hoping

1538
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,960
to buy gifts for everybody pay all my

1539
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:42,919
bills I just harvested this amazing flow

1540
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,358
I bring my five pounds in there right

1541
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,639
and I put it uh on the table and I'm

1542
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:52,239
like what's up and he's like I got some

1543
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:54,519
bad news so he's like unfortunately I

1544
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,879
can't pay 32 for this we bought some for

1545
00:58:54,519 --> 00:58:59,798
18 and I'm not going to be able to buy

1546
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,880
those was 5bs for oh and I was like I

1547
00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:02,880
don't know what I'm going to do can I

1548
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,440
see what they look like can I see what

1549
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,838
you bought for 18 I can't imagine that

1550
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,720
it's G to be that good yeah comes out it

1551
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:12,519
was actually for 18 was really good yeah

1552
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,519
it wasn't as good as what I had but for

1553
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:18,318
half price I mean it's hard to argue so

1554
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:21,199
basically we had to borrow money from my

1555
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:23,960
parents knife in the heart and and held

1556
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:27,159
I still got my money for the flower but

1557
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,079
it wasn't until like way after Christmas

1558
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:31,318
you start to get money in January and

1559
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,760
February but uh you know those are the

1560
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,599
kind of stories that make you I feel

1561
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,319
like this year that's gush mins everyone

1562
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,640
grew a [ __ ] ton of PCG gush mins well so

1563
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,318
gush mins the reason they grew gush and

1564
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,440
the reason people grow gush mints is

1565
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:47,440
because it comes out really good in

1566
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,200
Greenhouse or outdoor right espe GRE

1567
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,480
heds of it like there's thousands

1568
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:55,038
thousands and but it beasts out and it

1569
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,599
it's quality it looks it's frosty it's

1570
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,839
you know it's covered in Tri comes the

1571
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:00,880
structure is good some people are pass

1572
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:02,119
trying to pass it off as indoor they're

1573
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,480
it's it's what happened with blue dream

1574
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:05,039
where people didn't want blue dream so

1575
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,760
they changed the name to something else

1576
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,559
it's Blue Lagoon and it's like what the

1577
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,839
[ __ ] is Blue Lagoon yeah you know but

1578
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,559
like the same thing is happening with

1579
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,960
gush Ms they're like no this is Kush

1580
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:16,839
mins I'm like no this is Gushi so and

1581
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,199
you know it's like and it tastes good

1582
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:20,358
too it's another one that actually

1583
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:22,000
tastes good when you smoke it and so it

1584
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:25,358
kind of checks the box it's like the new

1585
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,119
blue dream um it's it's different fact

1586
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:31,000
but um it's what the market wants and

1587
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:32,960
it's a real great Exemplar of what we've

1588
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,559
seen now is that like cannabis strains

1589
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:39,920
have life cycles yeah they have like a

1590
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,319
beginning uh like they get born they get

1591
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,440
taken up someone wins an award the

1592
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:47,279
interest ratchets up it hits a peak

1593
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:50,480
where it's being over produced and the

1594
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,839
price Falls and the quality slips and

1595
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,079
fashion moves on and then it goes down

1596
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:58,599
down down and it either fully Peters out

1597
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,440
to where we get zero page views on that

1598
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:01,880
strain for the last month like there's

1599
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,720
literally no one in the world that even

1600
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,519
[ __ ] Googled that strain right or it

1601
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:10,639
has another cycle or it becomes like a

1602
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:12,440
classic like a a classic yeah I mean so

1603
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,558
shout out to C junkie for wedding cake

1604
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,920
and ice cream cake but those plants had

1605
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,519
their their day the wedding cake really

1606
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,000
had its day it was super popular same

1607
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:22,920
thing with the ice cream cake facts and

1608
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,798
I still like ice cream cake yeah don't

1609
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,159
argue with me on that people it's good

1610
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,318
ice cream cake is you know it got

1611
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:30,838
overproduced but because it was good

1612
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,558
yeah but because it was especially

1613
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:34,318
because it was good you know not because

1614
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,200
it yielded or anything else even though

1615
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:39,038
it yields fine it's because it smoked

1616
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:42,078
good and it smelled like ice cream when

1617
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:44,319
you open up the the bags of or the jars

1618
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,920
of it it really smelled like ice cream

1619
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,119
creamy dessert sweet extt taste just

1620
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,039
like that too it's like one of those

1621
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:52,559
ones you could pair with desserts it's

1622
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:55,960
so good I I was I recall like all the

1623
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,240
cakes score high on the arousing thing

1624
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,599
Leafly people are using them on date

1625
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:02,439
night and they're getting it

1626
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,599
on um wedding cake and ice cream cake

1627
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,000
and one other thing we've seen it's like

1628
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:07,480
remember when Co happened and they be

1629
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,278
like oh a new variant came out and it

1630
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,798
first it's like 1% of all samples and

1631
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:13,880
then it's like 40% and then it's like

1632
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,838
50% and the variant like crowds out the

1633
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,160
competition right I see that happening

1634
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:19,880
with strains like it emerges and it's 1%

1635
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,199
of the market and then the next year

1636
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,680
it's 10 and the next year it's like a

1637
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:27,038
good 50 yeah and we are just in

1638
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:30,000
successive waves of new fit

1639
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:32,119
strains colonizing vast vast chunks of

1640
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,920
the market like outsized chunks and

1641
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:36,000
there's no reason to think it would be

1642
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,798
equal a thousand strains everyone gets a

1643
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,400
thousand like one 1000 of the market no

1644
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:44,639
one strain gets 40% of the market and

1645
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,760
the other 9,000 fight over the Romanian

1646
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:49,480
60 dude rs11 and zope had a huge

1647
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,480
foothold for the longest time it's still

1648
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,079
going it's still going east it's moving

1649
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,079
East it's for sure it's moving East and

1650
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,880
people don't want to hear rs1 right now

1651
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:02,160
and I love rs11 I like z a lot too but

1652
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:05,119
like uh Maryland smoking black Z this

1653
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:07,399
week Maryland legal Maryland yeah I'm so

1654
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,200
happy for them that's great like they

1655
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,440
are like when you drop a cell phone in

1656
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:15,078
the bush yeah and they go from like

1657
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:18,278
nothing to like the newest [ __ ] right

1658
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:21,200
and like you got to watch out for those

1659
01:03:18,278 --> 01:03:24,039
populations because they take things up

1660
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:26,960
intuitively without the baggage yeah and

1661
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:29,359
um and then they do uh

1662
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,400
revolutionary uh sort of heretical

1663
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:33,920
things that actually are end of the new

1664
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:36,278
things right you know we're so precious

1665
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,599
with our ogs over here they're going to

1666
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:40,599
flip black zope into like black Maple

1667
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:42,278
and we'll be smoking east west coast

1668
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:45,240
will be smoking East Coast Maple zap

1669
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:49,159
next year yeah for

1670
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:51,439
sure yeah it's really wild so for for

1671
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:53,598
our viewers that don't know exactly what

1672
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,960
Leaf Le is or how Leaf Le works you want

1673
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,160
to explain that yeah I mean um leaf been

1674
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,039
around for 12 years it's got like 9,000

1675
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:02,920
strains in the database Leaf Le is the

1676
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:04,880
like Internet's number one weed source

1677
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,159
and people are are in the parking lot

1678
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,838
hooking up from their dealer looking up

1679
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:12,519
uh like um coffin candy and seeing if

1680
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:14,519
the picture matches and the smell

1681
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:16,480
matches they're using the site for

1682
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:20,239
validation on the elicit Market there's

1683
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:23,318
like 8,000 stores menus on Leafly now

1684
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:26,719
and you can get pickup in delivery so um

1685
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:29,759
in in Canada Uber Eats and Leaf Ley will

1686
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:31,199
bring you a burrito in a joint umazing

1687
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,799
yeah and we just like they just turned

1688
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:37,798
on another Province up there and so that

1689
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:39,719
like Leaf Le got to put new strains in

1690
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:41,440
the database every day as like it's like

1691
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:43,480
heartbeat because it started with a guy

1692
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,200
who Lov weed so much that he started a

1693
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,599
spreadsheet and you know what that's

1694
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,679
like to start putting weed in a

1695
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:51,798
spreadsheet you got to love it a lot and

1696
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:54,719
be pretty dorky about it to like start

1697
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:56,920
down that road but once you do you know

1698
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,519
um like they ended up with a big

1699
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,400
competitive Advantage the strains are a

1700
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:02,679
big moat for them and it's basically

1701
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,599
what the universe wants that company

1702
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:07,159
this company to do like uh strain

1703
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,640
breeders don't go to the United States

1704
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:10,519
patent and trademark office they don't

1705
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,879
go to the California Secretary of State

1706
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:14,559
they don't spend $5 million pulling a

1707
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,798
platin patent they just release it into

1708
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,278
the market get it on Leafly and like

1709
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:19,920
fight about it in the comments and

1710
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:23,480
honestly the guy that pushes it the

1711
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,159
hardest and sells the most wins the name

1712
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:28,358
yeah you know and um there's no

1713
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,719
Guild that is saying oh you can't use

1714
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:32,838
this name it's already been taken so our

1715
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,358
job is to wait in there every day and

1716
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:36,798
disambiguate and be like actually

1717
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:38,719
there's two sherbet hazes one's a gelato

1718
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,318
Haze and one's like a sunset sherbet

1719
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:41,959
Haze they're both being called sherbet

1720
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:43,838
Haze they're grown by different people

1721
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,358
they're actually very similar but that's

1722
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,318
what's going on there like no one's

1723
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:51,358
wrong it's just people need to know

1724
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:53,278
what's going on and um so this year we

1725
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,519
are going to put you know again a

1726
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:56,559
thousand strings in the database that's

1727
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:59,480
about five a day and and then we do 12

1728
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,240
to 15 monthly news stories that are

1729
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,079
really laser focused now on strains and

1730
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:06,558
products yeah um it's an Undiscovered

1731
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,839
Country It's the final frontier I've

1732
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:12,760
been doing this for 15 years and we've

1733
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:14,558
the new like the the law side seems more

1734
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,440
inevitable than ever we're at like 28

1735
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,200
legalization States or now 25 or yeah

1736
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,200
you can lose track it's happening so

1737
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:23,679
fast and 40 something

1738
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:27,399
medical like I'm less interested in like

1739
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:29,719
the turn a screw around legislature like

1740
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,639
like normal Outlets write about weed

1741
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:35,239
laws now what's wide open is digging

1742
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:38,159
into the cultivars the genetics the

1743
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:41,519
Breeders their stories like operating

1744
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:43,598
thesis is that like um there's a

1745
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,759
universe in every nug like you can use

1746
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,000
it like a keyhole and the more you look

1747
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,119
in and through it you will see the

1748
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,960
strange genetics the breeder how it was

1749
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:53,960
grown where it was grown why it was

1750
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,838
grown where it fits into why we're

1751
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,599
growing what we're growing and the whole

1752
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,440
culture and all of history like back to

1753
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:02,880
like the ships coming over well the

1754
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,278
value of this is so huge from if you

1755
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,200
look at the future of it right so over

1756
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:08,679
time what happens is the amount of data

1757
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,199
that you collect can be used for

1758
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:13,759
breeding and creating these huge trees

1759
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:16,038
of data you know and we want to know

1760
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,559
where it came from 50 years from now

1761
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:20,599
yeah I mean you you guys are setting the

1762
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:23,319
bar for the data that will be collected

1763
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:25,519
50 years from now and how we can compare

1764
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:28,038
and contrast and look at what was pop

1765
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,358
pop now and you guys collect data on top

1766
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:33,039
of all this stuff you guys have

1767
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:35,119
algorithms and I get to see like which

1768
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,880
states are smok in what and like in what

1769
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:39,960
order and you can see strains move from

1770
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,760
west to east across the country wow and

1771
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,159
you can see them go from like zero page

1772
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,200
views to like a top 100 in the country

1773
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,519
like a Billboard music charts well and

1774
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:50,679
for predicting Trends there's nothing

1775
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:53,679
better than collecting data point to

1776
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:55,519
data points to predict Trends yeah and

1777
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:57,798
if you can combine it with smoking

1778
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,559
everything you get your hands on yeah um

1779
01:07:57,798 --> 01:08:01,759
you can really be of value to this

1780
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:03,880
audience and that's like I'm the head of

1781
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,640
brand experience over there/ senior

1782
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,278
editor um they rely on me to like serve

1783
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:10,239
this audience and stay close to the plan

1784
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:13,159
and that means like growing it it means

1785
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:15,000
making seeds it means um I did the

1786
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:15,678
harvest book with Ed marijuana harvest

1787
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,719

1788
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:20,079

01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:30,838
with it and and um and uh and so you can

1793
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,838

the best yeah um and then the next layer

1796
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:41,880
on that for me is doing these

01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:52,479
it's like I'm so fed up with people not

1801
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,318
being able to get what they want after

1802
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:57,119

Valley is great at growing living soil

1805
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,158
you should learn about living soil you

1806
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,560
all right like buy buy this pre-roll now

1807

it just won the emerald cup it's CL it's

1808
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,120
like it's like putting their hands

1809
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:11,960
together being a connective tissue I

1810
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:14,198
love it and your events are amazing SF

1811
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,798
weed week was great I'm glad I was able

1812
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:19,039
to be a part of it thanks for turning up

1813
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:21,000
absolutely I mean like last minute super

1814
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,798
positive it was great it was great and I

1815
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,479
think you you've really picked a lane

1816
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:25,880
that could use improving a lot of people

1817
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:29,039
jump in the lane where everyone else is

1818
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,759
in that's popular event planning is

1819
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:33,359
something that we need more of and it

1820
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,359
not even more of we need more good

1821
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,359
events it's really difficult to organize

1822
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:41,000
something that lasts a week let alone a

1823
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:43,039
day dude you know I can't even imagine

1824
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,520
you know and it's it's a lot of work and

1825
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,039
so really impressive thanks it was like

1826
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,040
um doing a magazine where you have 12

1827
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:52,359
stories you got to land at the same time

1828
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:55,119
yeah you know um it's a lot of planning

1829
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:57,199
but it's all every one of those drops is

1830
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:59,479
a breeder with a story and a strain with

1831
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:02,158
the story and we're bring it in a a

1832
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:04,919
place that has a story and so

1833
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:06,519
programming a series of them that way uh

1834
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,039
was possible and our big breakthrough

1835
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,520
and I encourage anybody to do this is

1836
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:12,198
just like Center the plant like find a

1837
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,560
subject matter expert that knows

1838
01:10:12,198 --> 01:10:15,879
everything about what's going on right

1839
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,800
now and have them like pick your lineup

1840
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:22,239
um you know we saw stuff people do

1841
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,279
cannabis Bingo and cannabis fashion and

1842
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:26,839
people weird weed has this weird

1843
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:29,158
tendency to make people digress right

1844
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,520
and and so they take it's really easy to

1845
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:33,599
take your eye off the plant when you're

1846
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,120
being like trying to serve it um you're

1847
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,679
like oh we're talking about Osan now and

1848
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:41,599
I'm like well okay maybe but this the TR

1849
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,760
just came out like how how did they even

1850
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:48,239
get a Tomah Hill Hayes to put with the

1851
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:50,840
GDP to put with the Zeno and um and so

1852
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:53,279
you know those stories centering the

1853
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,920
plant and having really really really

1854
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,359
good weed or really really good hash at

1855
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:01,640
the center of your weed or hash Festival

1856
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:03,599
yeah um made it way easier because um

1857
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:07,560
then you just build out from around it

1858
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,920
um Kalia and Nasha and these other hash

1859
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,960
makers are they have audiences akin to

1860
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,960
indie rock bands right and so they're

1861
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,279
your Headliners yeah and you can make a

1862
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:18,880
poster and put them on it and a normie

1863
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:21,519
white be like what's Kalia and Nasha but

1864
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,760
a wook is like oh yeah this is going to

1865
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,360
be the best week of all time totally and

1866
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,719
it's literally me being like

1867
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:30,719
this if this is the best I could find

1868
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,198
yeah let me bring this together um one

1869
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:36,480
other thing was like you couldn't pay to

1870
01:11:32,198 --> 01:11:38,279
be on the poster like a headliner it was

1871
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:40,158
like when they program Outside Lands you

1872
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:41,759
don't get to pay to be on the stage like

1873
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:45,198
you just have to be a great musician

1874
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,920
like chap Ron having a moment yeah you

1875
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:50,799
pay chapel rone and so you can't like

1876
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,800
pay to get on our slate you you have to

1877
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,480
earn it and show up on the radar uh and

1878
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:58,800
so that that putting that at the center

1879
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:00,638
everything else just kind of like

1880
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,119
rapidly assembles underneath because

1881
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:04,039
people are like I want to be at that I

1882
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:06,719
want to be I want to stand next to that

1883
01:12:04,039 --> 01:12:09,319
yeah um and so like I encourage everyone

1884
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,600
to just like don't forget the if you

1885
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:13,079

1921
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:38,919
you know on a boat on a boat in the bay

1922
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:41,198
I took her sailing with my friend we hit

1923
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,520
another boat we were in the B you know

1924
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,079
what yeah you got to hear the story from

1925
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,280
Mila it's even better because it's so

1926
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:48,840
exciting but yeah we went out on the bay

1927
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:50,479
and we went sailing out of Salo it was

1928
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,960
like the Gilligan Island day where it

1929
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:53,839
was like beautiful and then it got

1930
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,319
stormy on us a little bit and the winds

1931
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,880
picked up and you know the bay when the

1932
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:59,519
winds pick up it could be crazy out

1933
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,920
there yeah two boats both decided to

1934
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,600
start turning the same direction and

1935
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,639
boom each in the bay yeah pretty wild

1936
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,360
but uh we both you in the water no we

1937
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:10,760
did not go in the water nothing no no we

1938
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:12,920
didn't go in the water it wasn't that

1939
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,840
crazy afraid of sharks [ __ ] I'm not

1940
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:18,279
afraid of sharks at all in the bay okay

1941
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:19,600
yeah I mean uh I don't you know I don't

1942
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:21,079
think you need to be afraid of sharks in

1943
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,199
the bay there's sharks in the bay but

1944
01:14:21,079 --> 01:14:24,760
like I'm not afraid I would I would be

1945
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:26,839
more afraid of the cold than I would be

1946
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,520
of the sharks yeah for sure yeah the

1947
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,319
cold will kill you in an hour right I do

1948
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:32,280
cold plunging and I could handle it but

1949
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:34,479
it's still cold that's still like

1950
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:36,920
especially for long periods of time I

1951
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,799
mean some people might pass out after

1952
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,480
five 10 minutes and other people they

1953
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,039
might make it an hour and some people

1954
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:43,479
might get hypothermia and other people

1955
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:47,399
they just can handle it where are you

1956

1962
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,359

1963
01:14:58,639 --> 01:15:02,440
like it's Kickback and simple it's

1964
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:05,839
coming up in like a month and a half

1965
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:08,279
yeah so yeah hash uh since 2014 has had

1966
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,960
a lifetime happen to it 10 years right y

1967
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:11,519
from like open blasting with butane and

1968
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,880
just basically like bubble hash curling

1969
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,520
irons yeah and then curling irons and

1970
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,520
and now this Tech like we're reporting

1971
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,520
on the static tech people so static is

1972
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:24,080
really really cool I get excited about

1973
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:27,040
static uh full melt static is so amazing

1974
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:30,158
and so good and so many TPS and I just I

1975
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:32,519
love it because if you're using water

1976
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:35,879
there's water soluble tpin right that

1977
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:38,199
you lose right yeah um and anytime it's

1978
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,960
going through a process whether it's CO2

1979
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:42,879
or BHO you're changing the chemical

1980
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:46,719
composition of it slightly yeah whereas

1981
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:50,159
sift you are not and I love smoking good

1982
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:51,279
sift it's just amazing um yeah there's

1983
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,479
something special about how do you smoke

1984
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:55,039
it cuz it's so you got to keep it cold

1985
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:57,198
and then you have to kind of press it

1986
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:58,920
okay you do yeah right off there God

1987
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:00,919
what was that like that sounds amazing

1988
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,760
it is it's amazing and you know so I

1989
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,679
remember the first time I got scissor

1990
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,520
hash back in the day yep and static

1991
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:09,399
reminds me a lot of scissor hash like

1992
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,639
good static you know yay so yeah I mean

1993
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:12,319
some of the turps that we used to get

1994
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:14,520
off the scissor house was the best and

1995
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:15,920
like we all we should trim for free all

1996
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,719
our friends we trim for each other we

1997
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,359
grew we go over to somebody's house we

1998
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:21,119
never charge them by the hour to trim

1999
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:24,399
maybe you get some weed or whatever but

2000
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:26,519
like back in the mid 90s there was it

2001
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:28,638
wasn't like that we hang out we loved

2002
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,679
weed we loved trimming for each other

2003
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:33,039
and when we harvested we needed help I

2004
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:34,840
needed help so I would and you know

2005
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,198
there was times we had we run trim trim

2006
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,760
crews out of my house my wife would man

2007
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:41,399
if I was there and I had a water plant

2008
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,719
she would run the trim crew and uh you

2009
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:45,119
know and it evolved more into a trim

2010
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,480
crew that got paid but in the beginning

2011
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,760
it was like we used to watch the In

2012
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:50,678
Living Color when it came on DVD that

2013
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,239
was what we watched over and over in

2014
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:54,319
fact I think I still have I've saved

2015
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:56,678
those because it's so nostalgic the DVDs

2016
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:59,840
and they have res on them still I must

2017
01:16:56,679 --> 01:17:03,319
have been like 2012 when I got some the

2018
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,520
first really high-end hash from spark

2019
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:07,519
that like like liquefied when you

2020
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,800
applied heat and so it ran yeah I don't

2021
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:13,560
know if it was a CO2 or what it was but

2022
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:17,079
um in 2012 yeah and so C so I used to

2023
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:18,719
sell in 2012 I sold CO2 to spark I was

2024
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:19,880
hitting I wanted to say like I hit that

2025
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,600
the only way I could find a way to hit

2026
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,440
that [ __ ] was hot knifing it into a cup

2027
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,480
so and did it look like peanut butter it

2028
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,759
looked it was like more of yellowish

2029
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:31,279
peanut butter consistency I used to sell

2030
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:33,800
that to spark and so my friends in

2031
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:36,198
Fresno they basically bought this Eden

2032
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,639
Labs extraction machine and it's like

2033
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:39,599
this rocket ship right and they're like

2034
01:17:37,639 --> 01:17:43,560
we're gonna make hella money so they

2035
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:46,120
made it and uh they couldn't sell it to

2036
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:49,159
save their lives and so I was already

2037
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:50,960
selling flower to spark and so I started

2038
01:17:49,158 --> 01:17:53,638
bringing in jars and they were they paid

2039
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,000
$20 a gram for it back in 2012 bought

2040
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:58,279
ret for it's not what people would like

2041
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,800
to see today but at the time it was

2042
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:02,840
great they used I believe they used it

2043
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:05,360
in Edibles and other things as well and

2044
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,079
CO2 was a cleaner BHO product right

2045
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:09,119
that's how people viewed it yeah I mean

2046
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:12,840
we had bubble and then there was that

2047
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:14,800
and this is again now 12 years ago and

2048
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:18,079
so we're from a generation that like hot

2049
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,480
knifed like I hadot like I was in maon

2050
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:21,119
and I tried to put it in a local pipe

2051
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:22,519
with the titties on the pipe and it just

2052
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:23,639
ran right through it was like gone it

2053
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,960
just got over my mouth you know and I

2054
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:26,719
was like I'm going to have to hot night

2055
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,719
this I don't this is before the internet

2056
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,198
really so you couldn't even Google like

2057
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,039
how to Hot Knife you just had to like

2058
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:33,599
give it a go yeah for sure you know and

2059
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:35,639
like catch it in the cup and then siing

2060
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:39,480
the cup and is that how you we used to

2061
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:41,400
use the the uh tubes for the uh paper

2062
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:42,759
towels that was the hot knife and you

2063
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:44,000
would you would put them together and

2064
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,600
then kind of push them in a little bit

2065
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,639
not really in but like enough to where

2066
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,960
the person could take the hit and those

2067
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:52,239
that sounds better CU we from the cup

knife hit and it was it was like taking

2070
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,399
a hot dab right but but with hash

2071
01:18:56,679 --> 01:19:00,639
typically that wasn't the same quality

2072
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:03,679
as what you would dab and it would wreck

2073
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:05,600
your throat it would cough sometimes no

2074
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:08,199
matter what you would cough don't even

2075
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:11,199
know yeah now we have live rosin carts

2076
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:13,599
Allin ones that are superb so I love

2077
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:16,719
half gram rosin carts I don't like one

2078
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,360
gr I feel like half gram Because by the

2079
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:21,480
time you get to the half gram it's about

2080
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:23,158
to be not as good okay at room

2081
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:25,439
temperature and everything else two G

2082
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:26,839
carts is crazy that they're super

2083
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,238
popular right now my buddy was saying

2084
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,360
two G carts are the new thing and

2085
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,799
everybody wants them and I'm like how

2086
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:34,039
could that be because when you get done

2087
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,400
with the gram it's gonna be [ __ ] by the

2088
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:37,880
time you get to the end of two grams you

2089
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:39,759
I won't even smoke it I'll give it to

2090
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,880
somebody I would never I guess they're

2091
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,360
just going to do whatever they could

2092
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,319
think of we also see the two carts or

2093
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,759
the three carts or the four carts and

2094
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:48,759
one whole thing so you can just stick

2095
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,000
that whole thing monster Hits and yeah I

2096
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,840
mean Innovation though right like you

2097
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,279
got to come out with n 90 things to get

2098
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,920
10 good ones

2099
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:00,359
99 to get one good one sometimes yeah I

2100
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,920
mean it's like fine no Scruples show us

2101
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:04,519
what you like tell us how it goes you

2102
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,199
know well and I'm excited about cryo

2103
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:10,159
technology um I think

2104
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:12,599
for um trimming dry and

2105
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:14,638
curing there's a couple companies we're

2106
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,960
about to have on our show and I think

2107
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:19,960
yeah well I'm excited for the potential

2108
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:22,319
of it so far I've been disappointed but

2109
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,399
I know I have trouble like uh I don't

2110
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:25,198
want to smoke astronaut ice cream right

2111
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,599
yeah

2112
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:28,919
where it's like the bud looks big and

2113
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,560
beautiful and like super light and it

2114
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,359
looks like it's still on the plant

2115
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:36,120
almost dude we're just not there yet we

2116
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:38,238
we potentially will be but there's a lot

2117
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:40,158
of things that happen in that dry

2118
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:42,319
process and the curing process that need

2119
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:45,079
to be mitigated for you to get good

2120
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:47,000
flour and and I'm not even sure what's

2121
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:48,960
happening like there needs to be phds

2122
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,960
written about like what's happening in

2123
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,239
your chlorophyll levels versus your

2124
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,359
water versus the resin cuz like we're

2125
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:56,959
seeing with drying and curine that like

2126
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,639
some things are degrading some bad

2127
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,119
things are degrading right and then

2128
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:02,199
eventually enough of them degrade that

2129
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:04,158
the good things kind of stand out well

2130
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:06,678
and I think what happens with the plant

2131
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:09,559
is that when you are going through the

2132
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:12,480
curing phase the stamata has to stay

2133
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,719
open to keep the moisture from you want

2134
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:16,319
to release the moisture from the plant

2135
01:21:13,719 --> 01:21:18,760
so the St has to stay open right and CO2

2136
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:20,759
will lock the stamata up and so with the

2137
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,719
TPL loocks which we are both huge fans

2138
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:25,400
of we both collaborate with TPL loocks

2139
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:28,679
their benefit is when you put them in

2140
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:30,759
there the lining absorbs the CO2 mhm

2141
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:32,880
preventing the stamato from closing

2142
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:36,360
allowing the moisture to leak out of the

2143
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,079
plant or you know into the into the bag

2144
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:39,519
whereas you don't have to burp it for

2145
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:43,399
the longest time you burp it it gets rid

2146
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:48,040
of excess CO2 all that stuff yeah and

2147
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:50,439
like the air somehow keeps things going

2148
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:52,079
uh Growers talk about how Oxygen's like

2149
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:54,000
salt you want a like you cook with a

2150
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,238
little of it too much bad but you need

2151
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,399
it and um have you you've seen this

2152
01:21:56,238 --> 01:22:00,678
where like you get a jar and it's not

2153
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,638
great and but you flushed it by opening

2154
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:04,960
it and trying it like and then you put

2155
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,400
it away for a while and it cures into a

2156
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,960
good spot and you open it again and

2157
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:10,839
you're like oh there it is totally um

2158
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,119
and now I I know and it feels very

2159
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,719
unnerving because it's hard to write off

2160
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:16,880
stuff that's just not cured yet it might

2161
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:20,239
be the best the grower is so excited to

2162
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,880
give it to you um but it needs two weeks

2163
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:23,279
that happens a lot for me too I get

2164
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,119
stuff when it's Super Fresh it happened

2165
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:26,960
the other day with some Skittles and

2166
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:29,960
they look like the most amazing Skittles

2167
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,039
and like I smoked it and the same cured

2168
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,319
out stuff normally has like this amazing

2169
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:36,399
white ash Oil ring tastes like

2170
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:37,880
cantaloupe a little bit it's like on the

2171
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:39,799
fruit they harvest it really early so

2172
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,800
it's not the gassy side of Skittles it's

2173
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,679
more like candy cantaloupe turps and

2174
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,199
when you I love it but then this stuff

2175
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:48,760
didn't have it and it was like kind of

2176
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:52,479
let down it was so fresh but uh you wait

2177
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:55,440
two weeks good to go Burns clean all of

2178
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:57,279
that uh you know I'm HP fan yeah and I

2179
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:59,678
don't I don't fully know why I know

2180
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:03,679
there needs to be phds where they like

2181
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:05,359
go and have like the control group the

2182
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:08,520
mod's closed because they flash it you

2183
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:11,439
know well so Jack from Turlock he's huge

2184
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:13,440
into R&amp;D and so he's done a lot of stuff

2185
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:15,559
uh I I love the work that they're doing

2186
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,359
they're featured in my book uh but I got

2187
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:19,120
rid of my jars and the thing is is I'm

2188
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:21,519
one of those trust but verify sort of

2189
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:25,279
people with chlock I was like a

2190
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:27,000
disbeliever I was like no my

2191
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:29,679
oh dude it's just another tough thing to

2192
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,560
believe well it it was a hard sell for

2193
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,480
me because I've been using myars forever

2194
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:36,080
and not a fan I prefer my glass jars and

2195
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:38,079
so over the last couple years I've

2196
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,800
gotten rid of the not even a couple

2197
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,719
years but in the last year pretty much

2198
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,279
my glass jar collection has gone way

2199
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:46,760
down I put stuff in tur blocks I do like

2200
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:48,840
jars sometimes I put my tur blocks in

2201
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,280
jars so they don't get smashed y because

2202
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,000
that's the one thing I don't like about

2203
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:54,238
the bag is you can put it in your pocket

2204
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and it just we still don't know go know

2205
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:59,638
what going on with a good oldfashioned

2206
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:02,359
wide mouth like Ball jar yeah cuz it's

2207
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:03,800
something it's I mean I love looking and

2208
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:05,000
you know there's the sea Vault too I

2209
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,039
think those are cool but there's

2210
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,439
something special about glass mason jars

2211
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:11,000
and maybe it's just nostalgic because of

2212
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:14,238
our age too where it's like no I think

2213
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,560
it cures like it got to me and maybe

2214
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:17,359
though science will just prove us wrong

2215
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:20,320
but like it gets better when you get it

2216
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:22,399
on glass and in and ball jar and cure it

2217
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:25,238
versus it staining in the turkey bag

2218
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:28,519
yeah um turkey bag yes block I think is

2219
01:24:25,238 --> 01:24:31,158
better I know that's the word I mean I

2220
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:35,560
came at it as like a the my bag as like

2221
01:24:31,158 --> 01:24:37,960
a um reporter I'm getting hundreds of uh

2222
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:40,000
uh samples a year yeah and I never have

2223
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:41,639
enough bags I'm like wading up paper

2224
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,600
with nugs in them that I've written on

2225
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:46,079
the paper because people are handing me

2226
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,600
stuff Y and or I would get a bag that

2227
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:49,840
was inappropriate like a Ziploc baggie

2228
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,239
or an all black one where you had to

2229
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,639
write on with like a silver Sharpie

2230
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:55,079
who's walking around with like a silver

2231
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:57,960
Sharpie um Luke

2232
01:24:55,079 --> 01:25:00,198
yeah and so I had these reporter's

2233
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:03,880
notebooks and I knew what Fields I need

2234
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:06,279
to report um and I also care a lot about

2235
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,719
TPS uh I have a joke Facebook group

2236
01:25:06,279 --> 01:25:09,800
called The turp Conservancy like the

2237
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:12,560
nature conservancy and it's like no turp

2238
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:14,960
Left Behind uh it drives me crazy when I

2239
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,960
smell turps because that's our money and

2240
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,600
our our time and our water and our

2241
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,600
nutrients and all this effort just like

2242
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,280
off gassing in a room from a bag that

2243
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,639
like someone carelessly left open you

2244
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:29,399
know right um I I even in stores like if

2245
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:32,079
I'm smelling turps in a medium hot store

2246
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:33,759
I'm mad cuz like that's the stuff in the

2247
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:36,279
thing the biggest problem with the rec

2248
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,840
Market on with Colorado what was up with

2249
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:40,519
those pop top jars they were using that

2250
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,800
just didn't even seal you know what I'm

2251
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:45,560
talking about the medical bottles oh

2252
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,520
dude and they're at like 5,000 ft and

2253
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:50,960
30% humidity the driest place and I'm

2254
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:53,000
brother brother yeah well you know and

2255
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,399
then Washington's the most humid play or

2256
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,880
you know as far as it's the polar

2257
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,399
opposite they've actually dialed in

2258
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:01,039
their packaging I feel like they've done

2259
01:25:57,399 --> 01:26:03,599
a lot better job but uh yeah dude like

2260
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,359
it but it's so critical like this that's

2261
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,079
the it's like you spend all this time

2262
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:08,559
and then you just [ __ ] it up at the very

2263
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:11,960
end but

2264
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:15,000
also I have a problem with the way flow

2265
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,600
is being brought to Market where

2266
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,920
sometimes the consumer doesn't get it

2267
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,000
for six months that sucks [ __ ] up you

2268
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,000
know what I mean and also it takes you

2269
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,359
know they deliver it in the middle of

2270
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,840
the summer in an unrefrigerated truck

2271
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:28,000
and then the dispensary doesn't have

2272
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,079
refrigeration and so even if it's only

2273
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,359
two weeks old it's been exposed to this

2274
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:34,079
hot temperature for a few days here hot

2275
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:35,759
it's not going to be as good right every

2276
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:37,840
little thing it's like a piece of a pie

2277
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,199
where you're at 100% you take something

2278
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,560
away from that pie every time you [ __ ]

2279
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:44,839
it up just like when you're growing in

2280
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:47,560
that 70 day of flour every little

2281
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:49,840
mistake takes away from that pie

2282
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,639
sometimes it's one% sometimes it's 2%

2283
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,679
sometimes it's 50% yeah if you miss a

2284
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:56,000
day and it just turns like a z and turns

2285
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,840
on you dude yeah one one day cuz that's

2286
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,520
like a life in a human year right like

2287
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,639
for the plant one day

2288
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:06,360
isent you can go downhill you can

2289
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:08,800
totally one day can be catastrophe I do

2290
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:11,279
like how because it's an Agricultural

2291
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,880
Product it has a peak you're holding

2292
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:15,118
something that isn't forever ostensibly

2293
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,639
I mean you can put some of these hashes

2294
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:19,439
away for years but in general um if you

2295
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:21,679
get something great you get a good batch

2296
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,399
from a grower at us Prime you're just

2297
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:26,399
seeing a view from a mountain top that's

2298
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:29,599
not guaranteed the next time right um

2299
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:32,439
weed gets old they the plant gets sick

2300
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,760
the grower cuts a corner um it's never

2301
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:36,439
stable like the the really good stuff

2302
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:38,320
like holding on to consistency month

2303
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:41,479
after month is probably like the hardest

2304
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:44,079
thing um and that's what keeps it ever

2305
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:46,879
exciting to me is like it's ultimately

2306
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:50,158
like it's not sop as I mean you can have

2307
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,600
Sops but it's still life and so it's

2308
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,679
squirreling out from underneath your

2309
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:58,159
Sops and [ __ ] with you um and the end

2310
01:27:54,679 --> 01:28:01,000
product can't be like that as Locked In

2311
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:02,879
Forever um and way you can preserve it a

2312
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,039
little bit you can have cold

2313
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,880
temperatures you know below 60 degrees

2314
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:09,079
if you really want to go for it and

2315
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,480
you'll maintain the qual and turp loock

2316
01:28:09,079 --> 01:28:13,359
bags or even jars or whatever but like

2317
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:15,158
maintaining it in a cold environment for

2318
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,079
it'll stay Fresher a lot longer I know

2319
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:18,960
guys that you know some of these guys

2320
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:22,118
that don't even trim it they'll put it

2321
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,439
in bins and then right when they sell it

2322
01:28:22,118 --> 01:28:26,399
is when they trim it they keep it in

2323
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:28,960
these cold rooms and totes or in uh you

2324
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,399
know clear plastic containers and so

2325
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,439
they can look at it all the time but I

2326
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:34,359
like that a lot too because I feel like

2327
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:36,238
those sugar leaves protect the flour

2328
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:38,519
they do House of cultivar shout out and

2329
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:41,519
they're they're like their own innate

2330
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:43,560
Bas like if it gets wetter the Sugar

2331
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,400
Leaf sucks up the water right and if it

2332
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,639
starts to dry out the Sugar Leaf gives

2333
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:50,638
up the water and the bud stays in there

2334
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:53,679
I believe it's part of a longer cure too

2335
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,118
so like as as you know we have the stem

2336
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:56,960
and the stem is where a lot of that

2337
01:28:55,118 --> 01:28:58,880
moist because the density of the stem a

2338
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,800
lot of that moisture holds on to the

2339
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,600
into the stem longer than the actual

2340
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,880
flour and then if you have sugar leaves

2341
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,679
on there and what happens with the Cure

2342
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,600
is you may have the perfectly dried Bud

2343
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:09,520
where it snaps but there's still

2344
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,520
moisture in that stem and if you do it

2345
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:15,280
in those bins it'll slowly go through

2346
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:17,480
the bud go into the leaf and then you

2347
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:19,198
have a perfectly it's an outlet right

2348
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:21,238
exactly it buffers it a little bit right

2349
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:22,799
it buffers that moisture I I I've

2350
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:25,678
definitely chopped off a bunch of leaves

2351
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:29,039
when I've harvested and not and I I'm on

2352
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:32,679
team not I just kind of chop and hang

2353
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:36,840
and do let the plant live and breathe

2354
01:29:32,679 --> 01:29:38,520
and expire versus make a bunch of cuts

2355
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,279
all over it that's just where I'm at as

2356
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,080
a hom grower who's trying not to try so

2357
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:45,118
hard and I I think like in my heart that

2358
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:47,479
like oftentimes doing less is the way

2359
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:49,839
yeah yeah so my personal back in the day

2360
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:51,319
because I for one reason I was like lazy

2361
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,159
with my own personal but I put it in

2362
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:57,399
mason jars on the stem I would you know

2363
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:59,158
obviously would put in totes uh burp it

2364
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:00,719
out and then they would go in jars and

2365
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:03,359
other people's the stuff that was for

2366
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:05,679
sale would get trimmed perfectly and

2367
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,799
then my stuff it would go in jars with

2368
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:10,800
leaves on it yeah Farm Cut yeah and I

2369
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,520
love that I I still love that and I you

2370
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,560
know finger trim we'd finger trim it you

2371
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:18,920
know yeah just beep beep meditative yeah

2372
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:21,080
for sure before that we used to trim wet

2373
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:24,399
yeah that was a big thing you know I

2374
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:27,118
know and everyone's got a reason yeah um

2375
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:30,279
but my best results have been doing less

2376
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:31,559
and and dry trimming yeah and um I got

2377
01:30:30,279 --> 01:30:33,599
no problem doing a little trimming you

2378
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:36,080
know a pound here and there it's

2379
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,639
meditative keeps you in contact with the

2380
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:39,920
plant you know how some cultivars are a

2381
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,520
delight to trim and other are a

2382
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,319
nightmare and that satisfaction of like

2383
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,080
getting deep down and snipping like a

2384
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,599
water Leaf right at the bottom of it and

2385
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:49,359
like not hurting the rest of the plant

2386
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,840
and totally and having this big pile

2387
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:52,880
that you're like how did we even get all

2388
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,279
that cuz you just did this little bit

2389
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,440
every day and you kept your head down

2390
01:30:54,279 --> 01:30:58,840
it's like such a good metaphor make

2391
01:30:56,439 --> 01:31:00,439
precise Cuts don't look at everything

2392
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:02,520
just take it one day at a time take the

2393
01:31:00,439 --> 01:31:04,118
bits when you're teaching people how to

2394
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,800
trim I always remember this because what

2395
01:31:04,118 --> 01:31:08,000
I would do is I would if there was new

2396
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:10,119
people in the room I would trimag gram

2397
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
up put on the table I'd say you need to

2398
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:16,559
do one of those every minute and you'll

2399
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:19,158
have a pound so basically in

2400
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,280
454 minutes you'll have done a pound

2401
01:31:19,158 --> 01:31:23,359
yeah right yeah it's usually a day right

2402
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:26,039
if they're you can get through it a day

2403
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:28,399
I mean I know trimmers that trim 2 lbs a

2404
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:30,399
day now five lbs a day my you know using

2405
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,839
the brush Tech finger trimming and brush

2406
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:34,799
Tech if you do it but that requires the

2407
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,560
right kind of flower and the right kind

2408
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,760
of node spacing you want good node

2409
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:42,119
spacing with very little leaf and then

2410
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:44,600
those uh trim brushes are

2411
01:31:42,118 --> 01:31:46,079
amazing I'm a huge so that's another one

2412
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,440
I was like this is stupid right for the

2413
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,279
longest time is this is stupid and then

2414
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:52,158
this this has happened throughout my

2415
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:53,960
whole life in this industry I'm like

2416
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:56,359
this is stupid or this is I don't like

2417
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:58,639
this I'm so so over that way of thinking

2418
01:31:56,359 --> 01:32:00,880
but with the trim brush I was like oh

2419
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,319
this thing looks like a barbecue baster

2420
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,239
brush just going to knock the tricomes

2421
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:05,799
isn't it and it's going to knock the

2422
01:32:03,238 --> 01:32:07,959
tricomes that's what I thought too right

2423
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:10,760
obviously I think most people think that

2424
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,399
it's very like it you know but it's how

2425
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:14,840
it works is you have to use the right

2426
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:19,599
temperature and humidity so if you're at

2427
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:22,039
6060 and you go for 10 days at 6060 and

2428
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,600
then your room you have you you can go

2429
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:25,000
even like 50 for the first day or

2430
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,119
whatever some people do different but

2431
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,760
60% humidity 60 degrees where the

2432
01:32:28,118 --> 01:32:32,960
tricomes are pliable but they're not

2433
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,960
going to snap off okay but it's not so

2434
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,639
hot that it's taken away from the turps

2435
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,158
yeah or affecting the flavor negatively

2436
01:32:37,639 --> 01:32:41,800
and what happens is you get the leaves

2437
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:43,599
that are they they become brittle uhuh

2438
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,800
right and so if you don't have a lot of

2439
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,719
leaf it makes it a lot easier for either

2440
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,400
finger trimming or using the the trim

2441
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,480
brush the orange you know the orange

2442
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:53,638
bristles with the white handle yeah cut

2443
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:55,238
that big handle off so you get this

2444
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:57,440
little thing in your hand and you can

2445
01:32:55,238 --> 01:32:59,079
really it becomes really meditative if

2446
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:00,559
you do it right because there's a

2447
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:02,359
specific motion you can go back and

2448
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,719
forth where you're spinning this stem

2449
01:33:02,359 --> 01:33:07,799
with one finger and going across and it

2450
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:09,840
gives you the best shape I feel like

2451
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:11,760
you're not a you're if you have trimmers

2452
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:14,039
they're not able to snip the tops off or

2453
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,440
round the buds you're really getting in

2454
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:18,279
there and doing a good job and you can

2455
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:20,678
do four to five pounds a day like that

2456
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:22,039
if you grow the right flour okay cuz

2457
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:24,560
I've definitely been in the dry room

2458
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:26,479
where like it's dry and if just even

2459
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,800
look at the goddamn plant wrong you can

2460
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:30,638
see little tricomes like floating off in

2461
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,760
the air you know like they're just

2462
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,440
they're ready like a to do temperature

2463
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,159
and humidity so if you dial your

2464
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:38,599
temperature and humidity in they and if

2465
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:40,559
you get it too cold obviously they'll be

2466
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,239
brittle and they'll break off right okay

2467
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:45,760
so you don't want it too cold you want

2468
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:49,198
that 60 or and it's a it's like it's a

2469
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:52,280
five degree range you know like 60 to 65

2470
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:54,118
you're okay with humidity I like that

2471
01:33:52,279 --> 01:33:57,359
cold temperature your trimmers going to

2472
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:58,960
hate it but at the same time it's not

2473
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:02,279
about the trimmers it's about the best

2474
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,600
end product possible apparently like um

2475
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:05,118
wine went through this where they're

2476
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,840
like God dang by the time we get this

2477
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:08,279
wine to Texas it's pretty warm and

2478
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:10,520
ruined can we like get some

2479
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:12,279
Refrigeration going yeah and now all

2480
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:14,400
wies on a cold chain well you know who

2481
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:16,920
started that well actually you know who

2482
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:19,679
started it with beer actually originally

2483
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:23,760
is loggan his BR praise be the cold

2484
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:25,079
chain yep so Tony and Jeremy uh they're

2485
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,560
featured in my book I talk about in my

2486
01:34:25,079 --> 01:34:29,639
book and it's pretty amazing uh I used

2487
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:31,480
to work with Logan a lot and they

2488
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:34,239
basically were the ones that wanted

2489
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:35,839
Logan to be the same wherever you go we

2490
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:39,559
want the same experience for the

2491
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:40,840
consumer right and so Anchor Steam I had

2492
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,880
this experience with Anchor Steam where

2493
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:44,480
you got it in Texas it was terrible

2494
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,000
right because it wasn't refrigerated

2495
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:48,319
held properly or Liberty ale is so good

2496
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,840
but the second you bringing out of San

2497
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:52,719
Francisco and drinking it Oakland is not

2498
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,639
as good Logan is super consistent across

2499
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:56,920
the the board because they would use

2500
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:59,400
refrigerated trucks for delivery and

2501
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:00,920
then that evolved to not just loganitus

2502
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:02,960
but other people in the industry doing

2503
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,719
it they got acquired by hinin hinin

2504
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:07,079
started doing it now everybody pretty

2505
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:09,679
much does it uh hinin is no longer

2506
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:11,118
skunky like it used to be and if you

2507
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,560
drink hinin now and you never had a

2508
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:14,719
skunky version of

2509
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,199
hinin it's a heck of a lot better now

2510
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:18,079
than it used to be it used to be this

2511
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:20,399
skunky you don't even think about it no

2512
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:21,800
it's not it's a very clean crisp beer I

2513
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:23,238
think of it more as clean and crisp

2514
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,360
whereas like it used to be skunky and

2515
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:25,959
funky

2516
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:27,719
uh we need to promulgate like a cold

2517
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,520
chain protocol and just give it away to

2518
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:32,000
the pot industry so we can hold on to

2519
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:35,520
those TPS you know where like I think

2520
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,840
you got to keep it under 60 65 yeah well

2521
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,199
we need to pull Tony McGee out of

2522
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,840
retirement and get him in the Cannabis

2523
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:45,839
industry getting

2524
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:48,159
these refrigerated delivery services you

2525
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,400
know as far as uh distribution companies

2526
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:52,920
that are all refrigerated show us how

2527
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:53,920
it's done I think there's people there's

2528
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,239
people that are watching the so they're

2529
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,639
like oh yeah they do it and it's like

2530
01:35:55,238 --> 01:35:58,678
yeah there are a couple people doing it

2531
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,840
there's pieces of it there are PE yeah

2532
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:02,960
there are pieces of it people have good

2533
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,960
intentions we talk about it now we need

2534
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,600
to execute yeah Soulful keeps like AC

2535
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:09,079
pointed at their flower wall so the

2536
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,520
flowers if like you touch the glass

2537
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:14,479
they're chill it's like 55 it's nice

2538
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,840
it's perfect Y and I think yeah like if

2539
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:19,519
you're leaving um a grow uh like if

2540
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,639
you're chopping down plants I don't know

2541
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:25,800
that they never ever should get above

2542
01:36:21,639 --> 01:36:28,239
what 60 6 5 6 somewhere in there like

2543
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:30,360
the colder you keep it so tpin are I get

2544
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:32,718
as a consumer and then go with God it's

2545
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:36,399
on you to not leave it in a hot car

2546
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:38,639
flavorant tpin flavor molecules are

2547
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:40,479
volatile and so the warmer it gets the

2548
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:42,920
faster they go away some are more

2549
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:44,959
volatile than other ones uh and it

2550
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,800
changes and so the cooler we can keep it

2551
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,399
the better the product is at the end of

2552
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,440
the day I want the best product possible

2553
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:51,559
for my

2554
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,678
consumers uh you know my my thing is

2555
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:55,679
seeds so I just want to empower the

2556
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:57,359
cultivation partners that I have and so

2557
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,279
we do a lot of R&amp;D on stuff like with

2558
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:02,639
TPL loock when I first got it we

2559
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:05,319
basically had a TPL loock a mason jar

2560
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:07,520
and then we had a t turp block mason jar

2561
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:09,880
and turkey bag and we had those and they

2562
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,760
sat on the Shelf at 60 deg same exact

2563
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,800
strain from the same batch from the same

2564
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,840
trimmer and I had those three sitting

2565
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,840
and I checked them once a month you know

2566
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,199
and we it's all anecdotal data I should

2567
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,159
have probably sent it to the lab each

2568
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:23,118
time and we'll do that again but

2569
01:37:21,158 --> 01:37:24,960
basically it was my nose because I was

2570
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:27,839
take a little little bit out smoke and

2571
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:30,039
they were all fine for the first two

2572
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:34,159
months okay and then you started

2573
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:36,399
noticing that the TPL block was fresher

2574
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:38,759
and then after month three it was more

2575
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:41,079
apparent that the Mason jar was better

2576
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:43,159
than the turkey bag sure and there are

2577
01:37:41,079 --> 01:37:45,079
different turkey bags so is I think

2578
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:47,598
they're polyethylene material or

2579
01:37:45,079 --> 01:37:49,639
whatever okay damn it there's not just

2580
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:51,119
one kind no and there's ones that are

2581
01:37:49,639 --> 01:37:52,359
thicker and ones that are thinner and so

2582
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:54,880
obviously the thicker ones are going to

2583
01:37:52,359 --> 01:37:56,679
be less porous then the thinner ones

2584
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:00,520
because all of it has pores right and

2585
01:37:56,679 --> 01:38:02,760
then um with the Mason jar the Mason jar

2586
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:06,679
was the next to start kind of changing

2587
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:10,440
on me and then after six months it was

2588
01:38:06,679 --> 01:38:13,399
very obvious nice shout out T tlock was

2589
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:15,399
was the one and then you know my buddy

2590
01:38:13,399 --> 01:38:18,039
buddy Lance my good buddy Lance works

2591
01:38:15,399 --> 01:38:19,638
for chpl loock so we did a collaboration

2592
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:22,719
with Lance and with Turlock and I

2593
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:24,239
featured them in my book and I feel like

2594
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:26,079
uh it's it's a great product and it's

2595
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:28,000
innovational and especially it's

2596
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:32,158
innovational a thing that I didn't think

2597
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:34,679
could be innovated upon for me polymer

2598
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:36,920
science it's got to be crazier than ever

2599
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:38,359
yeah and uh I think they did a good job

2600
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,920
with it that's why I'm rocking the the

2601
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:41,439
note bag for sure yeah well in their

2602
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,960
competition will be like well it's just

2603
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:44,439
hype it doesn't work it's like no I mean

2604
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,760
I thought that too and then I did the

2605
01:38:44,439 --> 01:38:49,079
test and the thing is is go do your test

2606
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:51,560
quit telling me what you think you show

2607
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:52,880
me the test where it's not better and

2608
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,400
and I'll show you the test that is I'm

2609
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:57,719
ready to get radical about sealing like

2610
01:38:55,399 --> 01:38:59,839
learning the science of like a good seal

2611
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:03,760
like like cuz theoretically you don't

2612
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:06,440
want any like micro mole like zero atoms

2613
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:10,599
exchanging right like and uh apparently

2614
01:39:06,439 --> 01:39:12,439
Uline has yeah Uline has good bags um I

2615
01:39:10,599 --> 01:39:13,719
don't know I just like again in pursuit

2616
01:39:12,439 --> 01:39:15,399
of like keeping the turps where they're

2617
01:39:13,719 --> 01:39:16,639
supposed to be yeah I can't control like

2618
01:39:15,399 --> 01:39:19,158
the people in my household that leave

2619
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:21,319
bags open but well they had the nitrogen

2620
01:39:19,158 --> 01:39:23,039
you know infused where they they they

2621
01:39:21,319 --> 01:39:25,039
had a nitrogen blanket that yeah they

2622
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:27,639
basically flush out the oxygen it would

2623
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:29,198
be like a nitrogen blanket and that was

2624
01:39:27,639 --> 01:39:31,920
popular with the cans right when they

2625
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:33,960
had to tun the cans for a while and went

2626
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,960
away you have to Ox reoxidize them then

2627
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:37,319
and they have to reopen up again because

2628
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,599
they'll just smell flat when you get in

2629
01:39:37,319 --> 01:39:41,840
there right and that's why they went

2630
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:43,960
away right so it's it's funny but we're

2631
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,480
still learning I mean I'm that's the one

2632
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:47,118
thing I'm excited about and there's so

2633
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:49,399
many things that are counterintuitive

2634
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:51,039
where I'm like oh yeah no that's stupid

2635
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:54,118
and I've learned to like eat my words

2636
01:39:51,039 --> 01:39:56,238
over and over and you got minded you got

2637
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:57,839
to be open-minded especially now where

2638
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:00,079
we're at look at LEDs like there's so

2639
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,400
many things that even if you thought you

2640
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:02,599
weren't open-minded before but you've

2641
01:40:01,399 --> 01:40:04,439
been in this industry where you didn't

2642
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:06,079
like LEDs and now LEDs are the ones

2643
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:07,359
they're good they're good they're really

2644
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:08,920
good they've gotten a lot better

2645
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:10,799
feminized seeds they sucked in the

2646
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,319
beginning I was now they're autof

2647
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,440
flowers that's another one where I was

2648
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:16,799
like no way autoflowers are bunk and

2649
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:18,198
then I make autoflowers now I love good

2650
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,920
autoflowers they're dude really good

2651
01:40:18,198 --> 01:40:21,399
autof flowers out there as if like there

2652
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,719
would be any other way like of course

2653
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:24,479
it's going to start out bad and they're

2654
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,279
going to get better like the Rockets

2655
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:28,959
don't just start out landing on on the

2656
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:30,559
on themselves like they fall over and

2657
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,118
explode a few times until they get them

2658
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,840
right and then there's all this baggage

2659
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:37,479
right like oh LEDs oh Autos they're the

2660
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:41,239
spa like we I'm smoking perfectly great

2661
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:44,399
LED weed yeah and we're seen amazing

2662
01:40:41,238 --> 01:40:45,759
autos auto that doesn't even like yeah

2663
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:46,920
there's companies out there I'm not

2664
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,880
going to throw them under the bus or

2665
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:50,560
anything like that but I know they're

2666
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,599
using autof flowers for their bags and I

2667
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,560
know because they're using my auto

2668
01:40:51,599 --> 01:40:56,520
flowers for but uh you know and there're

2669
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,760
AR ready for that truth no they're not

2670
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,360
people aren't ready for the truth and it

2671
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,960
might hurt their sales right but the

2672
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:02,319
truth is these guys are crushing it dude

2673
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,920
they're doing great and the flower's

2674
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:05,799
good and you know and we're talking

2675
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:08,880
about stuff where they can grow outdoors

2676
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:11,320
they can plant in May and finish in July

2677
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:14,239
have flower on the market you know I

2678
01:41:11,319 --> 01:41:16,679
think that's huge uh you know there's

2679
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:18,799
companies up in somoma and Lake County

2680
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:20,760
that are getting three polls a year and

2681
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:23,360
they're just starting to fix strains so

2682
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:25,960
to take out all heterogen 80 Like Straw

2683
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:27,679
Berry seeds and traditional crops so

2684
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,520
like you can it's like clones you can

2685
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:31,199
plant a row and everything you get Auto

2686
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,960
that's going to grow the same oh they're

2687
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,198
super consistent now with the the some

2688
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,760
of these breeders are breeding you know

2689
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:38,158
there's a handful of breeders doing

2690
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,639
really really really amazing work and

2691
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:41,279
then there's a lot of closet guys and

2692
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:43,560
guys doing small production but you have

2693
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:45,479
to go to at scale what I've learned with

2694
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:47,560
autoflowers is to breed autoflowers

2695
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:50,638
properly you need to breed them at scale

2696
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:52,280
so you need a big gene pool to select

2697
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:53,639
and it's still day one I tell people

2698
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:55,519
like we haven't come up with the cotton

2699
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:58,000
genin for cannabis yet like it's still

2700
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,960
all hands which is Medieval technically

2701
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,319
yeah um and so that means cannaboids

2702
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,000
when it's automated are going to be like

2703
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:06,158
just the life blood that you will swim

2704
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,439
in you won't even notice them they'll be

2705
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:12,279
so cheap on one end in like skin care

2706
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:14,079
products for example but on the top end

2707
01:42:12,279 --> 01:42:16,639
we're seeing the rosins the live rosins

2708
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:19,439
go for 100 bucks a gram yeah that's like

2709
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:21,199
uh more than the cost of gold per gram

2710
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:23,399
so you're dabbing gold now we're dabbing

2711
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:25,479
gold here the Golden Age I love it I

2712
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:28,638
love that and you know I'm I'm one of

2713
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:31,000
those guys who uh don't temp me because

2714
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:33,319
you got two grams of Skittles for 200

2715
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,399
bucks I will buy it

2716
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:38,279
theall buckets totally I mean I will I

2717
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:39,719
don't mind spending $100 a gram if it's

2718
01:42:38,279 --> 01:42:41,399
something because a gram can last me a

2719
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:43,760
long time with this little thing I can

2720
01:42:41,399 --> 01:42:46,479
make a gram you know I have friends that

2721
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:48,679
a gram might last them a day yeah and

2722
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:50,279
then if I have them over I mean I might

2723
01:42:48,679 --> 01:42:52,840
need to hide that a little bit but not

2724
01:42:50,279 --> 01:42:55,359
that I do but you know for for me I can

2725
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:57,440
make two grams last me a good month

2726
01:42:55,359 --> 01:43:00,158
maybe longer I have so many different

2727
01:42:57,439 --> 01:43:02,039
things to select from people are have

2728
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:03,399
such different tolerances you can see it

2729
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:05,158
in the medical literature you can take

2730
01:43:03,399 --> 01:43:08,319
someone up to like a th000 milligrams a

2731
01:43:05,158 --> 01:43:09,638
day and back down they're fine H versus

2732
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:11,439
like taking someone up to a th000

2733
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:14,000
milligrams of like hydrocodone a day or

2734
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:16,039
whatever be dead yeah yeah um totally

2735
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,359
and so some people and then their

2736
01:43:16,039 --> 01:43:20,039
incomes range so much that for some like

2737
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:22,799
hundred bucks is like a rounded drinks

2738
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:25,238
with the guys yeah and so yeah I'm going

2739
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:27,039
to spend gr on that I'm going to get a

2740
01:43:25,238 --> 01:43:29,000
bunch out of it a lot more than like 20

2741
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:30,960
minutes for a round of drinks at a

2742
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,840
pricey bar in San Francisco totally

2743
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,920
we're going to get two big fat hash or

2744
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,360
whatever whatever it is dude yeah like

2745
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,920
that's the thing with legalization is

2746
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,598
the joints have gotten bigger I'm all

2747
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,920
about the big you've seen my joints I I

2748
01:43:41,599 --> 01:43:45,279
do the big three and a half grammar

2749
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,920
learning I'm just getting up the skill

2750
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:49,880
yeah where you're just

2751
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:51,000
like yeah it well you know what I mean I

2752
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:53,159
think it's actually easier to roll

2753
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,520
bigger joints once you dial it in it's I

2754
01:43:53,158 --> 01:43:55,960
think it's easier because I don't even

2755
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,560
roll small joints anymore because I

2756
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:00,800
can't roll them as good as I roll the

2757
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:02,800
big the bombers yeah I mean they're

2758
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,960
that's a function of how like the price

2759
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,360
per unit going down like this was like

2760
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:09,880
unfortun in college to Like A month's

2761
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:12,238
worth of weed or two weeks or whatever

2762
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:13,840
well I'm loving the like such a crazy

2763
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:17,359
era we're in with seeds with the hemp

2764
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:19,199
bill yeah that I have to like um do my

2765
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:21,960
best to bring together the West Coast

2766
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:24,279
genetic scene after the Harvest before

2767
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:26,719
Christmas and that's where this idea for

2768
01:44:24,279 --> 01:44:28,880
this event TP namami is coming from and

2769
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:32,239
we're my goal is to get 20 breeders at

2770
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:34,800
20 tables over two days nice um for like

2771
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:37,638
a thousand Growers commercial and home

2772
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:40,159
Growers um on December 7th and 8th in

2773
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:42,400
the city nice and uh just to kind of

2774
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:45,039
like make a Triforce of events with like

2775
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:46,399
SF weed week for the flower hash week

2776
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:48,000
for the extracts it's going to be a

2777
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:49,960
rough weekend though I know people are

2778
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,359
coming back from MJ Biz they're going to

2779
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:56,239
be destroyed I know and my I my my

2780
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:58,439
thinking is that there it's a really big

2781
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:01,279
cannabis world there's a bunch of people

2782
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:04,399
for whom MJ biscon is not their scene I

2783
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:07,238
know for cost or culture reasons or they

2784
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:10,279
just don't want to go this year and um

2785
01:45:07,238 --> 01:45:13,238
there's so many more backpack readers

2786
01:45:10,279 --> 01:45:14,719
with just like a back and a dream tons

2787
01:45:13,238 --> 01:45:16,359
there's tons the sky is the limit

2788
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:20,118
there's when we did weed week and we put

2789
01:45:16,359 --> 01:45:23,439
out the call man the seed guys showed up

2790
01:45:20,118 --> 01:45:26,519
fast it's like portable you just do it

2791
01:45:23,439 --> 01:45:30,359
at a table oh yeah and um but I do think

2792
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:32,639
like California the West Coast Christmas

2793
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:34,519
time that's like seasonally and

2794
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:36,400
geographically when we should be getting

2795
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,119
together and having like big genetics

2796
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:39,559
combos that's when people want genetics

2797
01:45:38,118 --> 01:45:41,359
is in the winter because they're

2798
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:43,280
thinking about next year already and

2799
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:44,880
they have money from their Harvest and

2800
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:46,238
they have seeds from their Harvest

2801
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,960
tradition yeah tradition exactly they

2802
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:50,079
have seeds from their Harvest they have

2803
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:51,520
money from the the the guys who buy the

2804
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:54,039
seeds have money from their Harvest

2805
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,360
typically yeah or traditionally and now

2806
01:45:54,039 --> 01:45:56,639
people you know it's all around I

2807
01:45:55,359 --> 01:45:59,118
imagine some teams are going to divide

2808
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:02,679
and conquer and go to MJ biscon and send

2809
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:05,158
like uh two of their guys to turami yeah

2810
01:46:02,679 --> 01:46:07,158
um others are going to skip MJ biscon or

2811
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:09,198
it just wasn't on their radar but I

2812
01:46:07,158 --> 01:46:10,799
definitely want the West Coast in

2813
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:13,439
California and the Bay Area to be able

2814
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:17,279

2832
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:59,039
super excited I love these super groups

2833
01:46:56,279 --> 01:47:01,118
where everyone benefits and they're very

2834
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:04,439
innocent in a lot of ways you know I

2835
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:06,079
think that we all promote each other um

2836
01:47:04,439 --> 01:47:07,960
and I love that I love that when it's

2837
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,800
it's good brands and good people working

2838
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:11,880
together that can promote each other

2839
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:13,599
grow World works with a ton of people

2840
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:15,319
and they're I feel like grow world is a

2841
01:47:13,599 --> 01:47:17,480
lot like I am where we're Switzerland

2842
01:47:15,319 --> 01:47:19,439
like I have my friends and stuff like

2843
01:47:17,479 --> 01:47:22,238
that I don't bag on anybody's stuff and

2844
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:23,598
I try everybody's product I like all the

2845
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:25,118
different nutrient

2846
01:47:23,599 --> 01:47:26,880
and I like testing them and maybe some

2847
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:29,279
of them work better than others but I

2848
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,800
learn more about not only the products

2849
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:33,359
but also about myself and ways to grow

2850
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:36,159
when I'm using different products nice

2851
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:38,158
yeah um I uh I we saw with weed we and

2852
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:40,319
hash week that people want to get

2853
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:41,359
together they want to put Co behind them

2854
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:44,599
they don't want to have a reason to put

2861
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:01,079
the plane from SFO to line up to buy

2862
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:02,479
seeds from like Cypher genetics yeah and

2863
01:48:01,079 --> 01:48:06,399
then just get right back on the plane

2864

it's like a international spot um so I

2865
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:11,319
love the city I've been there for 20

great sites yeah um and just kind of a

2868
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:18,118
hub that's why I stay there otherwise

2869
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:20,118
I'd be enjoying like two acres SS and

2870
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:23,319
like growing you know oh yeah you know I

2871
01:48:20,118 --> 01:48:25,719
got my hand well so I do outdoor and I

2872
01:48:23,319 --> 01:48:28,439
do regular seeds at my house every year

2873
01:48:25,719 --> 01:48:30,840
that's that's what I do yeah um I've

2874
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:33,039
done it for a long time I I blew it out

2875
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,719
a couple years ago and just like stunk

2876
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:38,198
the whole neighborhood out and I lived

2877
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:39,960
on a court uh I guess I didn't live on a

2878
01:48:38,198 --> 01:48:42,359
court but I lived on a small driveway

2879
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:44,039
with lots of neighbors and everybody

2880
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:45,920
smelled it they smelled it on the back

2881
01:48:44,039 --> 01:48:47,880
side of my house the street all the way

2882
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:50,118
down I was hearing about botch ball

2883
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:52,159
players like talking about how bad it

2884
01:48:50,118 --> 01:48:54,759
stunk on their street and I'm like oh

2885
01:48:52,158 --> 01:48:56,439
interesting D it's actually yeah that

2886
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,000
there was the street behind me luckily

2887
01:48:56,439 --> 01:49:01,279
they thought it was on but I had 80

2888
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,560
plants in the backyard and so now I keep

2889
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:08,000
it to my six you know I feel like uh or

2890
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:10,199
or less I'm doing less this year less is

2891
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,840
more I got three but like I was doing

2892
01:49:10,198 --> 01:49:14,158
these banana crosses and I really wanted

2893
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:16,599
to explore what banana Skittles could be

2894
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,920
crossed into all these other things and

2895
01:49:16,599 --> 01:49:20,960
I love Skittles and I love banana and I

2896
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:23,319
love candy banana I got something that's

2897
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,319
more candy banana than banana runs but

2898
01:49:23,319 --> 01:49:28,639
those runs candies it taste just like

2899
01:49:25,319 --> 01:49:30,840
that I went after early girls this year

2900
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:32,840
I got I have like a little grow in Santa

2901
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:35,760
Sebastapol like a six plant grow and I

2902
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:37,319
get killed by the Fall Dew yeah and

2903
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:40,039
water you might as well be like hosing

2904
01:49:37,319 --> 01:49:42,118
down the plants yeah uh every morning in

2905
01:49:40,039 --> 01:49:43,560
September and October it's brutal you

2906
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:46,039
just have to like get out of the ground

2907
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:48,760
earlier than You' think and I went

2908
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:51,279
around to the eagle Clash asking for

2909
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,440
what finishes early and they were they

2910
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:54,238
scratched their head like God people

2911
01:49:52,439 --> 01:49:57,158
don't ask about early anymore go to

2912
01:49:54,238 --> 01:50:00,039
Empire yeah dude um so I did get a loo

2913
01:49:57,158 --> 01:50:01,359
Berry from Crockett yeah um that they're

2914
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:03,079
like this is the earliest thing at the

2915
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:04,198
you know we brought to the ego Clash

2916
01:50:03,079 --> 01:50:07,158
Brian's got

2917
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:09,759
fire and then I had some meno biscuits

2918
01:50:07,158 --> 01:50:11,118
from higher Heights Nate nice um and so

2919
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:13,000
I ended up just making seeds this year

2920
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:14,719
so I made like loco Berry meno biscuit

2921
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,399
seeds and I have like a super early

2922
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:20,920
dessert to hold on to how did you select

2923
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:23,519
your maale um you know Masonic told me

2924
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:25,920
to just like follow my instincts

2925
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:29,480
and so such a masonic thing to say I

2926
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:33,800
know I like I selected for Edgar Vig

2927
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:35,959
Viger and uh like the toughest one and

2928
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,440
but no the most important thing was it

2929
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:40,000
wasn't the strongest or the biggest it

2930
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:44,839
was the one that had the best turps it

2931
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,479
was the test mail nice of of the that is

2932
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:48,360
that's a great answer that's a great way

2933
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:49,839
to do it I think going for the one that

2934
01:50:48,359 --> 01:50:52,639
has the most TPS I mean I look for

2935
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:55,078
structure and it was like heads above

2936
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:56,520
one was one smell good yeah if there's

2937
01:50:55,078 --> 01:50:57,960
one that smells better that's probably

2938
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:59,360
the one to use you know I mean I think

2939
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:01,480
that's just cool I'm glad I did it yeah

2940
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:02,880
that that's the one thing like if one

2941
01:51:01,479 --> 01:51:04,919
smells better or that has a better

2942
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,840
stemra stemra is not always the end all

2943
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:09,760
be all and really the best way is to

2944
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:11,279
make seeds with it or with all of them

2945
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,280
and then grow the seeds out and figure

2946
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:15,078
out which maale is the best yeah you

2947
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:16,800
know I think there's and there's several

2948
01:51:15,078 --> 01:51:18,920
ways to do that but usually it's like

2949
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,480
it's not always the male that you think

2950
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:22,760
is the best that ends up being the best

2951
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:24,238
is what I've learned and sometimes you

2952
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:26,159
more than one male is another trick that

2953
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:28,078
a lot of people do I had a really

2954
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:31,439
frustrating year where like my A Team

2955
01:51:28,078 --> 01:51:34,078
all flushed out and the B Team kind of

2956
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:36,198
dragged ass and it was all the JV guys

2957
01:51:34,078 --> 01:51:39,639
that got cut in girls that were like

2958
01:51:36,198 --> 01:51:42,000
just like God like looking great totally

2959
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:44,679
neglected um easily the most vigorous

2960
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,760
ones and it just humbled me again I

2961
01:51:44,679 --> 01:51:47,440
don't know if you have those experiences

2962
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:49,320
you're like wow I thought knew what I

2963
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:50,879
was doing and the plant had a whole

2964
01:51:49,319 --> 01:51:53,519
different like lesson to teach me

2965
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,760
totally yeah you know

2966
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:58,199
anyway good times though and I I love

2967
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,000
breeding I love people pushing the plant

2968
01:51:58,198 --> 01:52:01,559
forward and learning how to breed I

2969
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,760
think and make seeds is something that

2970
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,599
everybody should

2971
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:07,000
do uh it's just a natural progression to

2972
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,679
being a good grower too after you've

2973
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,078
grown I think it's great to learn more

2974
01:52:08,679 --> 01:52:12,679
about making seeds like you learn more

2975
01:52:10,078 --> 01:52:16,319
about yourself so and it's just another

2976
01:52:12,679 --> 01:52:17,840
new thing and it's easy and hard and a

2977
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:19,719
lot of people are like oh if it doesn't

2978
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,199
come out great at least you got good

2979
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:23,000
seeds but like if you don't grow it

2980
01:52:21,198 --> 01:52:24,598
really well you might get powder meal do

2981
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,359
because the thing is is like when you

2982
01:52:24,599 --> 01:52:28,520
make seeds you need to harvest it later

2983
01:52:26,359 --> 01:52:30,960
typically than you normally would I go a

2984
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:32,760
lot longer when I Do genetics yeah when

2985
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,920
when I'm making crosses I I might go an

2986
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:36,760
extra month after the typical harvest

2987
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:40,520
date to get the best seeds possible

2988
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:42,560
especially indoor yeah so but it's a lot

2989
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:46,159
of fun and there's something to be so

2990
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:48,599
when you pick up a handful of seeds and

2991
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:49,920
drop them down the sound it makes

2992
01:52:48,599 --> 01:52:51,760
there's something special about that

2993
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,719
right I like a cross that never existed

2994
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,800
before I know that anyone's everever put

2995
01:52:53,719 --> 01:52:57,840
the local Berry on the meno biscuits

2996
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:59,719
like a little Crockett and a little

2997
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,960
higher Heights coming together you know

2998
01:52:59,719 --> 01:53:06,000
like a little Grass Valley and meno

2999
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:07,960
meeting again um it REM I mean I have

3000
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,840
kids uh it's great to have your own

3001
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:12,880
little fenos running around and the big

3002
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:16,199
takeaway from this year to me growing

3003
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:17,719
was like in school they'll want to like

3004
01:53:16,198 --> 01:53:19,519
you'd think like tracking is good oh

3005
01:53:17,719 --> 01:53:22,520
this is a smart K kid give him more

3006
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:24,280
resources yeah it like it's doesn't

3007
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:25,560
doesn't work out as intuitive as that

3008
01:53:24,279 --> 01:53:27,399
like there's actually probably a good

3009
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:29,119
reason to give them all a shot cuz you

3010
01:53:27,399 --> 01:53:31,519
don't know who the winners are the ones

3011
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:34,078
the early winners will flame out and

3012
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,800
some of the like lollygaggers well they

3013
01:53:34,078 --> 01:53:38,479
actually had the key the whole time

3014
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:40,119
right and so I I backed away from like

3015
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,238
the belief in like public schooled

3016
01:53:40,118 --> 01:53:43,679
tracking just from growing weed and

3017
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:45,879
being like man we got to give everyone a

3018
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:48,118
shot like the runs too well and that's

3019
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:49,560
another reason if you use multiple males

3020
01:53:48,118 --> 01:53:52,078
don't select all of them that are

3021
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:53,960
similar and I I like the multiple males

3022
01:53:52,078 --> 01:53:57,039
like using three males let's say let's

3023
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:58,359
say you pop 20 seeds or 50 seeds and and

3024
01:53:57,039 --> 01:54:00,399
you're looking for males you got your

3025
01:53:58,359 --> 01:54:02,000
females that you've separated and then

3026
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:04,078
your males that you're going to use I

3027
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,920
think picking them picking ones that

3028
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:07,439
represent especially with complex poly

3029
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:09,440
hybrids which most of us are working

3030
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:10,879
with you want something that represents

3031
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:12,439
maybe one of the parents something that

3032
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,760
represents another parent something

3033
01:54:12,439 --> 01:54:16,158
that's either in the middle or different

3034
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,920
and then you use the pollen from all

3035
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:19,479
three of those because you're making f1s

3036
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,880
if you're making f2s you would never do

3037
01:54:19,479 --> 01:54:23,158
that because you're trying to stabilize

3038
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,279
something that that's a specific way way

3039
01:54:23,158 --> 01:54:27,920
right same thing as you go into F3 F4 F5

3040
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:31,039
you would only use one donor and one

3041
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:32,840
receiver typically but in an F1 type

3042
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:34,960
scenario where you're making seeds

3043
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:37,078
sometimes more diversity is better yeah

3044
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:39,399
you know so you'll do like a mix of

3045
01:54:37,078 --> 01:54:41,319
three pollins on one oh yeah okay yeah

3046
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:44,118
or I'll open I'll just leave the pollen

3047
01:54:41,319 --> 01:54:46,078
let let the plants natural selection

3048
01:54:44,118 --> 01:54:48,679
natural selection they'll gravitate you

3049
01:54:46,078 --> 01:54:50,799
know I think uh Michael from Gage green

3050
01:54:48,679 --> 01:54:53,158
is big into like the natural selection

3051
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:54,480
the strongest survive and I did that

3052
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:56,359
this year I like popped the whole pack

3053
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:58,158
and they all went in the same container

3054
01:54:56,359 --> 01:54:59,598
cuz I've grown for six years and I've

3055
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:02,198
grown great weed and it was time to just

3056
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:03,840
[ __ ] around again and I was like you we

3057
01:55:02,198 --> 01:55:05,598
will have Mortal Kombat you guys will

3058
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,440
fight it out let let May the strongest

3059
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:09,400
survive it's a very gauge green thing to

3060
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:11,559
do for sure and like I fullon will like

3061
01:55:09,399 --> 01:55:13,679
transplant them like brutally just like

3062
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:16,599
put on a glove and be like yo come with

3063
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:20,078
me trying to like see who would be the

3064
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:22,119
toughest and um it worked you know and

3065
01:55:20,078 --> 01:55:23,679
there are some some some some reason

3066
01:55:22,118 --> 01:55:25,719
some reasons to go down that path for

3067
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:27,920
sure yeah and I mean and that's great I

3068
01:55:25,719 --> 01:55:29,639
like data collection too so like okay so

3069
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,239
we we actually took the pollen we

3070
01:55:29,639 --> 01:55:33,118
separated it at different location we

3071
01:55:31,238 --> 01:55:34,559
took that pollen put on this Branch

3072
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:36,559
covered that Branch with a pollen bag

3073
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,920
let it sit in sprayed it down with water

3074
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,880
and then we did that on multiple

3075
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:42,118
branches right and then we separated

3076
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:45,039
those we grew those seeds out to test

3077
01:55:42,118 --> 01:55:46,960
them and a lot of stuff what we're doing

3078
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:49,279
now is collecting a lot of data so I

3079
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:50,760
make a cross in a small amount we grow

3080
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:51,759
those out before we do any large scale

3081
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:53,840
seed production I want to know if

3082
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,560
there's sex traits all these important

3083
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:57,360
things before I do a big batch of

3084
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:59,280
something where I make half a million

3085
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:01,000
seeds of one cross last question is it

3086
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:02,840
ever like Jurassic Park where [ __ ] just

3087
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,479
escapes the lab like is there ever [ __ ]

3088
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:07,119
growing in the medians or like I feel

3089
01:56:05,479 --> 01:56:09,879
like the genetics want to just like

3090
01:56:07,118 --> 01:56:12,238
creep out and spread I hope my employee

3091
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:14,920
no my employees would never take

3092
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:17,118
them the everything is so closed loop

3093
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:20,118
here right everything air filtered in

3094
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:22,559
air filtered out no no pollen gets out

3095
01:56:20,118 --> 01:56:24,359
in the atmosphere no pollen gets in the

3096
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,400
building hopefully you know we have

3097
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:28,238
protocols for that as a homeg grower

3098
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:30,158
there are volunteers in the yard that

3099
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:31,638
I'm like I don't my backyard too I

3100
01:56:30,158 --> 01:56:34,399
guarantee you whoever's living in the

3101
01:56:31,639 --> 01:56:35,760
house I was in there's volunteers to pop

3102
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,118
up every year it's probably going to be

3103
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,320
for a while yeah which was again that

3104
01:56:38,118 --> 01:56:42,598
end goal for for what the plant wanted

3105
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:46,118
so it's nice to be of use yeah I mean

3106
01:56:42,599 --> 01:56:49,039
there's ditches in uh some

3107
01:56:46,118 --> 01:56:50,960
Midwest uh midwest states that are are

3108
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:53,279
filled with feral weed you know that

3109
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,840
just grows wild by the way side comes

3110
01:56:53,279 --> 01:56:57,279
back every year yeah when they were

3111
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:59,239
trying to ban it in Congress like

3112
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:00,920
incredulous legislators were like you

3113
01:56:59,238 --> 01:57:03,959
mean the [ __ ] that grows along the train

3114
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:06,840
tracks that's like trying to ban bees or

3115
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:08,760
like ban maple trees it's like were you

3116
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:10,800
going to go get it all is that what

3117
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:13,360
we're going to do here like if people

3118
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,079
want to know more about David DS yeah

3119
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:18,279
where would they go I'd say download the

3120
01:57:15,078 --> 01:57:20,639
Leafly app and uh get notifications

3121
01:57:18,279 --> 01:57:23,238
we'll publish the Leafly Buzz column

3122
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:25,639
once a week or once a month that's a a

3123
01:57:23,238 --> 01:57:27,078
Roundup of West Coast fireflower we do

3124
01:57:25,639 --> 01:57:29,639
things like strain of the year every

3125
01:57:27,078 --> 01:57:31,719
year and Bud tender choice and strains

3126
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:33,719
of Summer and harvest we just put out a

3127
01:57:31,719 --> 01:57:37,039
big gummies package for the country and

3128
01:57:33,719 --> 01:57:39,279
a big Vapes package for Labor Day um and

3129
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:40,800
we can stay really busy um finding all

3130
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:43,118
these cool new things like all-in-one

3131
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,360
live rosin carts all across America live

3132
01:57:43,118 --> 01:57:47,000
Ros and gummies all across America

3133
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:49,039
really cool and uh and then I'm on

3134
