00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,080
how's it going everybody welcome to

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
another episode of the James loud

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,919
podcast and today my special guest is

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,480
Brandon from in-house genetics how you

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,239
doing today Brandon doing pretty good

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,439
how about yourself I'm fantastic man

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,320
thank you for coming on the show thank

9
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:20,879
you for making the trip down to the Bay

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,439
well I appreciate the time one of the

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,799
things I one reason why I came down here

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,559
so I could sit across from you so we

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,640
could we can have a conversation because

14
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,960
the the zoom's kind of you kind of lose

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,920
a little bit I agree 100% I like these

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,840
in-person conversations better I feel

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,920
like you get to know somebody you get to

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,040
look in their eyes like and and really

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,480
see who they are you know I wish they we

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,878
were talking about longer style formats

21
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,799
I wish we had some more longer style

22
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,718
formats but these have been really

23
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,119
interesting the studio my transition

24
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,920
from the future cannabis project where

25
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,519
it was all Zoom to the in person I

26
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,359
really like these better well I I mean

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
it's impressive too I mean you put a lot

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,399
of work into it taking it very serious

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
you got a mad respect for that and I

30
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,799
appreciate you actually doing it because

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
the the space needs it right it's a

32
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,679
great way to get the comp you know the

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,320
content and information out to people

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
that actually really need it that are

35
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,319
also learning because you know growing

36
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,000
you're always always learning yeah and

37
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,798
we're in this big transitional phase in

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,200
the industry where it's great to be able

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,960
to talk to some of the people that have

40
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,040
a lot of history with the with the plant

41
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,719
with the the black market transitioning

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,960
into recreational you know like yourself

43
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:27,920
you you know you've been around a long

44
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,319
time and uh let's actually dive into

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
in-house genetics and kind of let's

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,239
let's take a step back from that and

47
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,759
talk about where you get started in the

48
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,000
industry yeah so when you talk Black

49
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,200
Market I like to refer to it as the gray

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Market never should have been illegal in

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,040
the first place I 100% agree um but yeah

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,879
it's it's like any other typical story

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,399
initial introduction right High School

54
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,438
smoking right to then selling getting

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,359
packs we come from the Pacific Northwest

56
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:56,559
so beers was a thing right then you had

57
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,840
this local right and that's where uh

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,039
where you initially kind of get a start

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,960
and then then uh what I noticed was was

60
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,599
is you had Canadian and then you had

61
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,759
local and the person at local was just

62
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,280
super fire and I was like man you know I

63
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,560
would love to start growing you know so

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
you start search and nobody really

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,199
talked to each other back then you know

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,878
so you had to kind of go search for a

67
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,518
plant and so this is probably around

68
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,439
this time about 2002 2003 right you know

69
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,560
so like any typical situation you start

70
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,800
off in a closet you know it was way

71
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,598
different back then yeah yeah but um but

72
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,560
as you grow and you sort of start kind

73
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,679
of creating like a co-op like meeting

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,318
people it's like kind of a secret club

75
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,000
right and so you're coming up like that

76
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,079
and then you started getting pretty good

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,439
at it and so in House's two people came

78
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,280
across met my partner and uh he was uh

79
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,039
really into genetics and he started

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,719
really uh diving deep into it but one

81
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,400
thing that I had is I had these grows

82
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,158
around the city you know and I was just

83
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,560
more on the production side of stuff and

84
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:56,759
I I started noticing when he was uh when

85
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,039
he first you know we started making

86
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,598
seeds and then he just started getting

87
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,759
you know good at so that's why I started

88
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,959
paying attention and then U we were

89
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,079
talking one day and he's like let me let

90
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,759
me build a room out in one of your

91
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,480
places and I was like well what about

92
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,039
the pollen you know like you know you're

93
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,238
going to you know what happens if you

94
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,519
see down my whole place and he's like no

95
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,400
no no it's all good and so from there we

96
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,480
just started building out you know 10 x

97
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,439
10 areas you know 8x5 area rooms right

98
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,039
digging them out and and doing it doing

99
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:30,000
it properly and so that was that was

100
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,479
about the time that uh really came

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
fullon in in in the in-house genetics

102
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,518
because he was about a couple years you

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,319
know into it getting getting pretty

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,560
established and then it was just like a

105
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:43,238
match made in heaven because I had all

106
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,799
these all these you know genetics that

107
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,120
we were sourcing so you had access to

108
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,680
the The Cult of ours yeah well

109
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,360
combination between the two of us right

110
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,079
right uh mirroring the libraries

111
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,040
together and then breeding stuff yeah

112
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,439
yeah because um because especially about

113
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,078
the time because when you're thinking

114
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,959
about it is is we always base oursel off

115
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,120
a quality right so that the highest

116
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,799
quality flowers and also going after so

117
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,878
like when you start growing OG strains

118
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,079
extremely hard to grow you know and like

119
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,399
when back in the day with the Bubbas

120
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,200
you're going to get big old huge buds

121
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,000
right and you know everybody loves that

122
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,078
but when you got into the ogs they were

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,680
small hard dense buds you know the the

124
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,918
turkey bag didn't look that big right

125
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,879
didn't have the peeling but once you

126
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,240
start breaking it up once you start once

127
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,600
you start tasting it all that it changes

128
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,160
you know uh so that's where you come is

129
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,080
is you pride yourself on the on the

130
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,400
quality so you're trying to find what's

131
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,120
the next thing or what's going to be the

132
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,519
next thing so either you're popping

133
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,840
seeds and hunting them right or you're

134
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,240
sourcing sourcing the cut so at any

135
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,239
given time we've always had anywhere

136
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,720
from 30 to 100 different strains in some

137
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,759
sort of rotation and all that you know

138
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,160
and so as this is all going on uh

139
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,479
in-house is growing right and uh we're

140
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,680
uh we're hunting through a ton of the

141
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,599
beans at any given time we're sourcing

142
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,840
stuff it gets starts getting really

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,680
super super busy we're just ultimately

144
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,478
having a good time but one thing that

145
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,199
was really cool about it was we're

146
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,000
putting in all this work but this this

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,639
this following is amassing this in-house

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,560
Army we start seeing these tags we like

149
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,400
the post and this is about the

150
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,280
transitional time of social media coming

151
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,839
on board becoming a big thing but it was

152
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,599
cool because it was like a natural

153
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,159
flowing uh buildup relationship that we

154
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,319
have and when it comes to when it comes

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,039
to the work ethic right we work hard

156
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,080
we're always working and so when you

157
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,959
think about is like like in-house in

158
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,000
itself is kind of like an iceberg right

159
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,599
everybody gets to see the tips of it but

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,800
they don't really they don't get to see

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,120
all the stuff that goes on 100% all the

162
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,840
time like so whether it's through text

163
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,478
message email uh whiteboard whatever it

164
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,038
is we're constantly working on something

165
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,519
and the communication is critical uh

166
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,439
between us and so what we do is is I'll

167
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,318
be working on something he's working on

168
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,918
something well uh any given time we'll

169
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,080
know if something's coming on but one

170
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,758
thing that uh we really that's huge to

171
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,159
us is we listen to what people are

172
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,280
saying and what I mean by that is is if

173
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,840
you're talking about something that you

174
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,598
used to have or you didn't have anymore

175
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,359
and you know you know cans will go in

176
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,959
Cycles right so you're trying to figure

177
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,038
out what's the next thing right and all

178
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,478
that and the reason why we've been so

179
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:19,000
successful in that is because we listen

180
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,279
to what people are saying right so if

181
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,120
people weren't talking or or you know

182
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,318
being active right we would we would we

183
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,038
would be missing it would be a big huge

184
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,199
component and that's one thing that's

185
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,360
that is really we proba yourself on is

186
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,720
is the people that support us and the

187
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,000
people that uh we get to interact with

188
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
and we're always watching we're always

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,759
listening there an example when it comes

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,360
to testers and everything else right

191
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,479
those are people that we wash for months

192
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,879
some cases Years and we're like hey you

193
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,959
want to uh you want to work with us and

194
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,719
and they're like yeah and the cool part

195
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,638
is is if you go back in the history of

196
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,080
the testers they're now high flying on

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
their own you know right so so we've

198
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,719
been we're part of a lot of people's

199
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,520
stories not just from the testers but

200
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,240
the seed bank so there's this this huge

201
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,038
mesh and and you guys were breeding TPS

202
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,759
in you guys were breeding good turps

203
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,519
into your genetics I feel like part of

204
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,000
your breeding program was always to

205
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,439
offer good turs you know so that comes

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,360
back to the Quality right so like um so

207
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,079
you know we have notebooks on notebooks

208
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,360
on notebooks right when it comes to

209
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,478
hunting and selections right right and

210
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,120
then uh uh plant Health right you know

211
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:28,839
you have to have the most Optimum

212
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,918
healthy plant if you're going to do any

213
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,318
sort of uh breeding any sort of

214
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,680
pollination because it's going to affect

215
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,199
it as a whole so now you're taking all

216
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,879
this information putting it together and

217
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,759
you're like okay this this this may be

218
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,599
good but also when you look at it the

219
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,400
hits right is one number but all the

220
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,279
misses right quadruple that or or way

221
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,399
more there's a lot of stuff that never

222
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,719
even hit the you know Hit The Cutting

223
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,918
Room floor you know yeah it's it's

224
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,240
statistical it's a statistical game to a

225
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,918
degree you know breeding but fenal

226
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,560
hunting and going through the selection

227
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,158
process is so you know it's so

228
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,680
challenging and it's so crucial that

229
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:06,879
you're able to grow really well and I

230
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,879
think that's where some companies have

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
hit it and some companies have missed

232
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,280
you have to be a if you're doing

233
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,439
selections you got to be able to grow

234
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,878
good so you can tell the difference

235
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,279
between this this and this and maybe

236
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
that's 100 times over yeah but like but

237
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,359
let's go back to what I saying in Cycles

238
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
right so depending on what's going on

239
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,560
around the country What's going around

240
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,199
so like like you have you have what you

241
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,598
have is you have like California that's

242
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,319
basically Mecca to the Cannabis world

243
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:32,000
right um then you have the sneaker which

244
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,240
is out of Vancouver which actually took

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,799
a lot of Amsterdam cups over the years

246
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,120
which gets glossed over a bit so you

247
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,918
have this prideful Folks up in the

248
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
Northwest where we're from and so you're

249
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,439
you're you don't really want to do what

250
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,240
everybody else is doing right but so so

251
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,760
when you're going after something you're

252
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,600
looking for uniqueness and constant

253
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,039
uniqueness and that's where the the tpen

254
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,320
profile starts coming in you start

255
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,199
learning and understanding what a tpine

256
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,640
is right uh we just thought there was a

257
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,320
handful of them at first now there you

258
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,159
know coming to find out there's three4

259
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,399
100 of them you know and THS and all

260
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,639
these other things you know I think

261
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,320
there's 40,000 different different

262
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,559
unique tpin flavor molecules yeah well

263
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,079
that's say so when you start doing your

264
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,239
stem rubs when you're you're checking

265
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,958
the bud structure this is kind of pre

266
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,799
before we could get some testing right

267
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,599
but also too testing is a flaw in a bit

268
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,278
because everybody's so set on high THC

269
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,680
right you know which when you go through

270
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:24,559
high THC you got to understand that

271
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,719
there's going to be some stuff that's

272
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,439
missing there's going to be the CBD

273
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,879
that's going to be gone right there's a

274
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,839
toll that it takes for a high THC so

275
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,200
back in the day when we were in the low

276
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,399
20s range you know we still had a beef

277
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,800
of a CBD that's where like when people

278
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,600
get nostalgic that's the weed that they

279
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,879
talk about you know right so now you're

280
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,639
taking like I said you're constantly

281
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,759
taking this information and then you

282
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,958
have this whole library of plants and

283
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,120
and also too if you can't find something

284
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,919
or you don't have it you have a whole

285
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,720
world out there of hom Growers that you

286
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,000
can hit up hey can you give the profile

287
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,000
on that d d du what would it take for me

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,759
to to get a cut of that I want to grow

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,120
that out cuz I'm going to you know put

290
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,159
into rotation and that's one thing that

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,839
we do a lot is is we go back to the

292
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,759
people that support us and we hit them

293
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,200
up like hey you know can we get a cut of

294
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,399
that and a lot of times people would be

295
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,560
like I'll give it to you for free like

296
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:12,958
no we got to give you something in

297
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,319
exchange or or whatnot but that just

298
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,759
goes back to always constantly hunting

299
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
for for the best you know and staying on

300
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,879
on top of that you know and we've gotten

301
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,759
really great hits by taking you know two

302
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,200
great strains right you know and

303
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,600
Crossing them together you know uh like

304
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,839
we have a juggernaut that's out there

305
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,800
which is slur you know slur is always

306
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,480
will be special to us you know and

307
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,359
there's a couple reasons as an example

308
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,759
slur uh so it's it's it's coming we

309
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,120
we're harvesting for the hunt drying it

310
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,639
didn't really think anything too much

311
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,399
about it yeah uh so you know my partner

312
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,320
comes in the building and and uh he's

313
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,360
like you got to check this out you know

314
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,680
and we were trimming uh actually a local

315
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,000
uh strain true OG right we just took

316
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,439
down we we had all the trim there so we

317
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,440
had about 15 trimmers there and it's

318
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,399
like there was all this commotion and

319
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,800
the slur King it just like at that time

320
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,078
you just didn't see that trione build

321
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,639
like that M and we just all kind of sat

322
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:16,120
there kind of like in amazement and was

323
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,240
like damn and uh my partner goes man I

324
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,720
tried to post this yesterday on

in order to boost the test right that's

351
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,360

365
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
those out as freebies let's put those

366
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,879
out to the world so when they get a pack

367
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,639
because what you'll see is is some will

368
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,439
release months or even a year or even

369
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,519
two years down the line and they see it

370
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,720
they go oh I got that in a freeb you

371
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,759
know so like one of the coolest things

372
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,399
that stick out to me on the freebie

373
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,919
aspect is I stopped by Farm down in

374
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,480
Oregon and and we've become great

375
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,120
friends since then it goes by Rogue

376
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,959
farmer right and he bought probably 30

377
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,000
packs right but he also had 30 just C of

378
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,559
In-House crosses and he goes I just

379
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,240
popped everything and I'm running

380
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,159
everything wow and uh and that was said

381
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,360
and he's like because everything that

382
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:24,078
we've gotten from in-house so far is is

383
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,720
is great and it flies and so that's

384
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,879
about the time when you know

385
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,079
legalization was just coming on you know

386
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,679
and I think it was like first like a

387
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:33,278
couple years that's when we had to kind

388
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,359
of look and see what that what that

389
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,919
looked like and how that was going to

390
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,278
shape and how we were going to fold into

391
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,319
that story but it but but originally but

392
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,039
with the slurricane though there's the

393
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,920
slurricane and the Platinum cush breath

394
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,679
there's a few things where we just know

395
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,639
that will always always stick out and

396
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,958
the people came back loved it right they

397
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,519
said you know that's where people um cuz

398
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,479
when you start hearing people's feedback

399
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,560
in a way where they go hey uh we bought

400
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,399
I bought my in-house pack and and I was

401
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,919
I I was I was doing good with these

402
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
other strains but once that once that

403
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,679
in-house got into my garden he's like

404
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,000
people started calling me you know uh

405
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,039
one guy one guy sat in line at a high

406
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,839
times event which they were notorious

407
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,639
for long lines I'm just getting in there

408
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,079
right the guy sat in line for five hours

409
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,839
and he's like man I just had to come

410
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,078
come meet you guys and see what's up you

411
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,000
know he's like he's like before I was

412
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,198
just average he's like now my whole my

413
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,919
whole garden is inous he's like I got I

414
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,278
got the dispensaries calling me this was

415
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,399
I think up in Michigan or something like

416
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:29,600
that and I was like man that's that's

417
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,159
what about I said why don't you just

418
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,240
call me I would have just came out you

419
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,120
know you know you to stand in line in

420
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,519
the heat for first five six hours but

421
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,639
but that's really where everything comes

422
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,120
from is is it's the people that that

423
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,000
that you get to see have success from it

424
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,399
and then also too there's there's a

425
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,198
there's a great relationship there

426
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,039
because what they put out to the world

427
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:56,120
we triy to to return to them right you

428
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:59,120
know and sometimes uh you know sometimes

429
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,959
it's like it's a it it it gets kind of

430
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,600
strange right because in the small world

431
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,679
we're a really big huge deal right but

432
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,879
in the normal world right nobody knows

433
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,879
so you have to meet that person halfway

434
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,240
so that's where I think it's a it's a

435
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,600
great relationship between any breeder

436
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,198
and the people that buy their packs

437
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,000
because there's a two-way street there

438
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,198
you know I'll meet you halfway let's

439
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,320
make this happen and send us your send

440
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,599
us your photo we'll put it up social

441
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,000
media has made that a little bit

442
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,639
difficult the past couple of years

443
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,559
because they you know they want to take

444
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,360
you down for sure but yeah yeah social

445
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,518
media has changed a lot in the last 10

446
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,278
years you know it's like I think social

447
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,839
media can fool people too where you got

448
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:39,318
some stuff that looks amazing but then

449
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,000
in reality they're like they go to buy

450
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:43,919
it they pop some seeds and they get some

451
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,679
stuff that has cardboard turbs you know

452
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,198
and it's really evolved and that's

453
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,000
there's a blessing and a curse

454
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,318
associated with social media and I I

455
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,720
love the fact that we've been able to

456
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,919
get out there and it's United a lot of

457
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,440
people that we wouldn't normally be

458
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,599
United with from all around the world

459
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,319
too well it's a social media

460
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,159
double-edged sword yeah cuz without

461
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:04,799
social media we wouldn't be sitting here

462
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,159
PL simp right so the plant brings

463
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,838
everybody together cuz without this

464
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,159
plant I wouldn't know you you wouldn't

465
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,120
know me right and uh and if it wasn't

466
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,719
for also too was for social media if we

467
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,318
could just stay doing our work and what

468
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,319
would you know we would have never we

469
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:22,039
would have never came out publicly or

470
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:24,519
been as as vocal as we are but also too

471
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:27,759
we started seeing Rumblings right of the

472
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,959
changes and and you know how things go

473
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,120
when money's involved in this country

474
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:35,559
right you know so when you start seeing

475
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,799
okay you know the reason why we're so

476
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:41,000
vocal and support of homeg Growers right

477
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:42,719
is because we feel at the end of the day

478
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,039
that that's who made us that's the

479
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
reason why I get to sit here and have

480
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,838
this conversation with you right you

481
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,799
know so our our loyalty will always ride

482
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,199
with them no matter what 100% you know

483
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,198
and uh and people are understanding that

484
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,198
and that message is being conveyed so

485
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,240
you know we've been part of some you

486
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,719
know action groups and and and

487
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,480
advocating and stuff like that but

488
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,880
without social media you wouldn't be

489
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,640
able to you wouldn't be able to do that

490
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,880
right yeah it's it's interesting and how

491
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,000
it's evolved and you know YouTube you

492
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,880
know we've started to catch our stride

493
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,160
on YouTube with the show and but you

494
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,880
know and then we started on the future

495
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,360
cannabis project and then that kind of

496
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,280
evolved into this and now we're starting

497
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,599
to catch our stride in with this and uh

498
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,279
you know it's been a lot of fun and also

499
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,719
yeah it brings people so you get a

500
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,279
little bit of everything speaking of

501
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,960
YouTube Right YouTube's great because

502
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,798
there an algorithm that brought me

503
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,120
across the James loud podcast right so I

504
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:43,038
I knew of you right you're a well-known

505
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,759
person but I was like I'm going to check

506
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,679
this podcast out and I think it was like

507
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,160
episode number 10 or 12 or something

508
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,038
like that yeah I just let it keep

509
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
playing autoplay right I was like oh

510
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,879
this is great content right and that's

511
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
where I think a lot of stuff needs to

512
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,120
get shifted to is is putting out those

513
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,360
type of content getting these stories

514
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,798
out getting people cuz cuz like I said

515
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,639
is is you can find tidbits of

516
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,440
information that might help somebody and

517
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
if you only help one person then the

518
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,120
whole thing is worth it absolutely you

519
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,200
know yeah I mean same thing with my book

520
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:14,399
it's like if I change one person's life

521
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,519
and make their life better or educate

522
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,919
them in a way that's positive I mean I

523
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:19,839
think at the end of the day it's all

524
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,720
about putting positive things out there

525
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,038
like you can do one or the other it can

526
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,360
just you know there's not a lot of stuff

527
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,960
that's just neutral either you're a

528
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,879
positive influence or you're not well

529
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,519
also two you have people that just want

530
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,080
to see the world burn right then there's

531
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,720
actual people that are out there that

532
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,199
want that want to truly learn and that's

533
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,400
the void that you're fing right uh out

534
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,880
of the podcast that you cut i' I've

535
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,400
listened to damn near all of them I mean

536
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,000
I spend we're always working right so

537
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,720
you got headphones in and either it's

538
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,558
between music or podcast and there's

539
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,159
some good stuff out there and it's like

540
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,879
uh there are people that want to learn

541
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,360
and there are I want to tell these

542
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,039
stories of these amazing people because

543
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,479
there's so many amazing people in the

544
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,759
world that have great stories and it's

545
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,159
it's for me to be able to capture them

546
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,400
it's you know I feel really great being

547
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,559
part of it going in the future that's

548
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,120
where that's critical and I think that's

549
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,440
where you're going to highly Excel into

550
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,719
that is bringing these stories outed out

551
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
you know like we were joking before the

552
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
show I was like man it' be funny because

553
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,879
you could do a VH1 behind the scenes

554
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,159
right AB but also also bring these folks

555
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,080
cuz CU there's a lot of cool stories

556
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,440
right there's a lot of like um like it

557
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:25,798
wasn't too long ago that I used to wake

558
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,279
up anxiety just ridden because I was

559
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:31,720
like is today the day I get cracked yeah

560
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,639
you know right because it's not you're

561
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,240
scared you're not you you're scared

562
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,159
you're nervous all that stuff because

563
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,839
because at the time if you got cracked I

564
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,720
knew I was making the news you know what

565
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,879
I mean right like absolutely like

566
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,600
multiple places all this stuff and and

567
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,400
uh and that's a lot of stress to be to

568
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,719
be having right you know then the

569
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,600
medical starts coming on and they get a

570
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,600
little bit of relief of pressure and so

571
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,079
um you don't really grow up or you stop

572
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,918
thinking that way but you know like

573
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,158
anybody that's ever done the gray Market

574
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,000
as you would say Black Market has had

575
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,600
those fears you know the thing is is is

576
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,359
we signed up for it because we knew what

577
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,480
we were doing right and and also two if

578
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,319
you got cracked you know keep your mouth

579
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,480
shut right you know you knew the job was

580
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,918
dangerous when you signed up right and

581
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,400
so that you know over the like the same

582
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,720
people that I worked with uh you know

583
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,720
back in the early 2000s are still in it

584
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,679
in some sort of capacity I'm still good

585
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,038
friends to this to today right you

586
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,038
like I got a good friend he's going back

587
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:33,359
and forth from Thailand doing some stuff

588
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,839
and actually being getting a lot of

589
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,038
In-House love over there he goes by uh

590
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,000
his name is Tony is Seattle's best on on

591
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,558
Instagram right but we've been friends

592
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,960
for over 20 years you know so these

593
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,079
bonds and these relationships and all

594
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,400
this stuff that you build but also too

595
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,240
we come from a time when 99 plants was a

596
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,720
federal case you know and it was a big

597
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,558
deal right and so I think where a lot of

598
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,360
people that came up in the medical side

599
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,158
of stuff right especially in California

600
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:02,918
all that they don't they don't really

601
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,200
necessarily felt that fear right or or

602
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,880
have that same sentiment so they're

603
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,558
really Blas about a lot of stuff you

604
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,000
know especially important stuff so

605
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:13,639
that's why I say is as quick as it

606
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,319
started it could end overnight off of

607
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,720
one ruling you know and and so when you

608
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,399
when you take that in account where some

609
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,120
people be like no that'll never happen

610
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,600
you know but like I said everything's

611
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:25,879
profit driven so now you know we're

612
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,480
getting a you know we're getting all

613
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,120
this information that's coming out like

614
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,360
one of the big lies that they tell you

615
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,839
is oh we can't research or we're not

616
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,719
researching this or we need to research

617
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:38,199
this right but if you go to the NIH

618
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,240
website you can see since 2015 they've

619
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,960
spent almost $2 billion researching

620
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,919
cannabis right more than half of that

621
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,759
money went to the negative effects of

622
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,520
cannabis yeah right and what did they

623
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,319
come out with they came out with

624
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,119
inconclusive evidence right and they

625
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,599
just throw this random stuff out there

626
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,319
right which which in many cases you can

627
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,719
make an argument that other medications

628
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,439
right are the cause of of what they're

629
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,480
claiming that can contributing factors

630
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,038
for sure cuz it's really important to

631
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,200
people to know what CB1 and CB2

632
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:07,879
receptors are right they're in your body

633
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,120
they're like slots so if you have a

634
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,080
medication going into it those slots

635
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,359
fill up right and then you put cannabis

636
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,918
on top of that your body's going to try

637
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,038
to expel it yeah right so you're going

638
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,038
to have these adverse effects you're

639
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:20,038
going to have these issues it's just

640
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,440
like if you if you you know you know

641
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,960
over over consume right you know those

642
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,038
receptors are full and your body needs

643
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,640
to expel it so you're going to have

644
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,558
these crazy effects right you know so

645
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
there's a lot that goes into I'm not a

646
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,038
stuff that I've learned over the years

647
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,599
from talking to doctors and talking to

648
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,119
bhds you know right there's uh you know

649
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,918
there's a there's a lot there's a lot to

650
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,278
it and we're just simply scratching the

651
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,159
surface surface of it as a yeah we're in

652
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,440
an infancy the industry is I mean I

653
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,960
think a lot of people think we've come a

654
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
long ways but we still have a long ways

655
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,960
to go and we're just starting to

656
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
understand the plant you know from a

657
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,360
medical perspective and it's it's a

658
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,480
beautiful time to be in the industry too

659
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,000
so it's a great time to well no look it

660
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,120
was never even when it was illegal and

661
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,720
you were dodging cops it was still a

662
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,879
great time to be in there like when if

663
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,640
you want to get nostalgic about it it

664
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,278
was a stressful terrible time but at the

665
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,320
same time if you were talking to another

666
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:15,278
grower right and you got past the the

667
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,879
you know like you know the the vague

668
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:19,599
conversations you would have you know

669
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,080
right tomato you grow right then you

670
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,639
start getting down and you start sharing

671
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,599
ideas you start sharing tips there's

672
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,159
there's a lot that that comes with that

673
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,678
you know right and I don't mean to

674
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,760
Discount the people that are struggling

675
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,200
right now because I think there are a

676
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,519
lot of people in the industry that are

677
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,400
struggling and they're trying to figure

678
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,000
out their next move and how to make it

679
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,360
and I think the price has gone down all

680
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,798
over for flour it's a very competitive

681
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,759
market and the one thing I can say is

682
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,918
grow a better product that that's the

683
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,400
biggest thing is like to be competitive

684
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,200
you have to create something that's

685
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
better than what else is out there I

686
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,679
mean before people used to get buy

687
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,278
growing middle-grade product and that's

688
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,640
that's gone that whole middle-grade

689
00:23:54,278 --> 00:24:00,200
thing is gone I think that people that

690
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,600
live that 1% if you're talking about

691
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,519
quality they're going to survive and

692
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,519
they'll be able to Pivot and and

693
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,879
hopefully be successful I think it's a

694
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,440
beautiful I would say that there's

695
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,240
there's room for all of it and what I

696
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,640
mean by that is this is you have a

697
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,000
situation where you have you always have

698
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,559
your top high quality right you're

699
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,640
always going to have your have your

700
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:20,038
folks for that they're going to

701
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,880
recognize that they're going to go hey

702
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,519
this is cu cu cannabis is a social

703
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,360
situation right right and also two it's

704
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,398
a competitive situation I found the

705
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,599
better found the better flower found the

706
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:32,158
better rosin whatever it is you're

707
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,719
always going to have that demographic

708
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,080
then you have the people that just kind

709
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,880
of want to something to turn the world

710
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,879
off for a minute yeah which which mids

711
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,760
will fill that up but what what I think

712
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,880
the real problem is and a lot of people

713
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,839
especially if you're in the commercial

714
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,640
world yeah go into any dispensary any

715
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,278
retail look on the wall right take note

716
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,240
of every strand that's on the wall yeah

717
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,240
then go back to your grow and don't grow

718
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,120
that right because you're going to

719
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,839
compete against in some markets a

720
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,519
hundred other people's version of fill

721
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,480
in the blank and people that can produce

722
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,398
it for cheaper unless you grow better

723
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,120
quality it's it's hard to compete with

724
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:04,319
somebody who has a lower price point so

725
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,479
based off of the stuff that we've done

726
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,200
in the past and especially in the

727
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,679
commercial realm yeah 2017 2018 friend

728
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,200
of mine comes or he's a friend of mine

729
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,038
now but at the time we just I think he

730
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,240
just hit me out on a Facebook page or on

731
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,480
Instagram or something like that and he

732
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,480
was like oh I run this 502 in Washington

733
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,558
and yeah I'm looking for new genetics

734
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,558
right and I was like well come on byy

735
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,839
our spot you know and we'll see what's

736
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,158
up you know so I get to talking to him

737
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,839
his name is Roy he's like uh he's like

738
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,559
I'm looking I'm growing this growing

739
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,678
that and I said so is everybody else

740
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:34,038
yeah right and uh I think at the time we

741
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,038
had the and the way the black cherry

742
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:39,319
punch was coming up um there was a few

743
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,679
there was a few that were just just

744
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,960
coming into stride on social Med like

745
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,798
you know the tags and all that yeah and

746
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,798
uh after you got off the initial little

747
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,480
sticker shock for the Clones right you

748
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:50,918
know I said man this this might change

749
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,319
this might change what your you know

750
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,038
might change your way of doing things

751
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,038
right went back groom and you can go

752
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,000
back in the day they used to track uh

753
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,720
502 data and you could go back to that

754
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,679
date that he would that he got those

755
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,839
plants and he could see 3 months later

756
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,360
that his numbers went up now there a

757
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,599
combination of two things genetics and

758
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,439
his hard work right right so you you

759
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,199
know uh genetics is the foundational

760
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,600
part and the hard% in his hard work and

761
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,840
so uh same with uh I mentioned him

762
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,398
earlier Rogue farmer right runs heavy in

763
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,599
house every year and does great you know

764
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:29,119
uh one of the he's probably one of the

765
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:31,319
hardest working Farmers that I've met

766
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,158
along the way and I've met a lot but uh

767
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,879
hands down when it comes to outdoor

768
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,080
light dep you know which everybody

769
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,000
throws shade on one of the best out

770
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,678
there you know people throw shade on it

771
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,200
but it's a great if you do it right

772
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,600
light dep is an amazing product uh you

773
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,240
know and then the mix light with

774
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,119
supplemental lighting is you can create

775
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,798
a product that you know people are going

776
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,678
to hate that I say Superior to indoor

777
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:55,798
but I feel like the natural sun with

778
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,960
light you know and now they have these

779
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:59,918
inner canopy lighting that that you can

780
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,720
use to tighten up those buds I think

781
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,640
that's the future in a lot of ways and I

782
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,880
think it's a it's a more environmentally

783
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,960
friendly product uh but it also is a

784
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,559
different product well it's it's also

785
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,480
too like when you the Mad Dash when

786
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,879
everybody got into the industry one

787
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,399
thing that stood out to me was like why

788
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,000
are we building indoors only reason why

789
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,599
we grew indoors is because we needed to

790
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,159
keep it away from the people that have

791
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,319
alphabets on their chest you know what I

792
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,600
mean the alphabet letters right that's

793
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:31,918
you know why we needed to do that but

794
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,158
when you look at the Dutch and all this

795
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,120
other agricultural folks that just kill

796
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,200
it in every other crop right cannabis

797
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:41,558
isn't much different right so you can

798
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,159
create pristine environment in a in a

799
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:45,918
glass uh you know uh Greenhouse yeah

800
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,760
know these venos these Dutch venos are

801
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,200
amazing I've been in some green houses

802
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,640
where they got the flood and drain right

803
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,720
there in the right there in the right

804
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,159
there in the floor you know this big old

805
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,640
huge orb comes out every day right like

806
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,360
clockwork literally you know utilize it

807
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,000
now there's a learning curve like

808
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,519
anything but also too I think uh when

809
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,519
when when we're talking recreational I

810
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,000
think a lot of people uh had the

811
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,480
learning curve from going from say like

812
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,798
a th000 feet to 30,000 feet oh yeah

813
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,360
right there's a lot of these factors

814
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,480
that go in it but most of all and I

815
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,158
can't stress this enough your biggest

816
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,558
enemy isn't the guy growing down the

817
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,120
street from you your biggest enemy is

818
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,319
the state right the politicians that are

819
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,639
making these crazy bogus rules off of a

820
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,720
whim look at aspergilus in Oregon you

821
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,038
know for example that I mean that my

822
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,000
opinion on that was I don't think they

823
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,480
wanted to open that Pandora's Box

824
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,839
because you start opening that Pandora's

825
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
Box you you put it in the law you can

826
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,759
push that over to food right now

827
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,158
cannabis is safer than our food supply

828
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,558
right when it comes to what you can put

829
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,039
on food compared to what you can put on

830
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:49,558
cannabis right but they also too as a as

831
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,599
a group pushed back on it yeah right but

832
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,119
also too the you know the powers that be

833
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,158
were like actually we can't really open

834
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,119
this Pandora's Box they're going to

835
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,720
start digging around kicking the Box

836
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,239
around next thing you know we're going

837
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,558
to get we're going to get some results

838
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,480
that we didn't want you know what I'm

839
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,319
saying right and and a lot of people

840
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
don't recognize and rightfully so they

841
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,278
got their whole you know they got their

842
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,278
regular life all that stuff but but if

843
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,759
you really took a second and realized

844
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,319
how we're you know these rules and

845
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,919
everything is Ming it it's not for the

846
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,200
greater good of what's going on but

847
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,559
that's where I was saying before is is

848
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,278
going off a Washington standard so if

849
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,278
you're tier one that means you're 2,

850
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,679
square foot grow and then if you're tier

851
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,558
two that's a 10,000 foot cap grow if

852
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,600
you're a one or a two I would say take a

853
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,759
minute and find out your other tier ones

854
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,439
and your other tier tws yeah go meet

855
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,200
them go talk to them right you don't

856
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,798
have to work with them just do know of

857
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,159
them right but support each other on

858
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:44,798
social media with you know however works

859
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,519
right because you have the much larger

860
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,158
guys that can outproduce you lack a

861
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,079
better terminology but it can flood the

862
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,600
market yeah but as a group you got to

863
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,038
getting that information into people's

864
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,158
hands and they're seeing it on their

865
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:57,798
screens right they're going to go oh you

866
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,840
know what I'm going to go check this

867
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,839
this this label out right because we

868
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,439
don't have that distinction yet outside

869
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,879
of a couple of situations where where

870
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,320
you have a branding right and then the

871
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,600
the larger brands are normally already a

872
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,119
small operator you know fulfilling those

873
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,918
much larger brands that you see across

874
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:17,359
the country or whatnot these msos and

875
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,519
Washington's beautiful though Washington

876
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,240
I love Washington I work with the house

877
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,278
of cultivar up in Washington and also

878
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,839
can Organics I work with them on the you

879
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,798
know we've done projects together and

880
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,839
stuff like that um but I love Washington

881
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,119
it's it's smaller and I feel like it has

882
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:32,759
an educated market up there like I think

883
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,000
the the customers are a little more

884
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,879
educated than in other states uh they

885
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,839
trust their brands look Pacific

886
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,600
Northwest is always found and carved out

887
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,678
their own lane yeah right make no

888
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,199
mistake about it like um like we are

889
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,480
literally in in the rain shadow right of

890
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,558
California you know so but uh but what

891
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,720
that said is is that's just that just

892
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,240
goes to show the tenacity of of people

893
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,960
that are from the Pacific Northwest

894
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,839
right we're going to find a way right

895
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,079
we'll we'll bump the car we'll crash a

896
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,439
car along the way but we're going to

897
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,960
find a way and we're going to be the

898
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,480
best at it now you have uh you know

899
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,960
other places that are that are going to

900
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,319
catch up but when you look at the model

901
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,840
that's up there I don't necessarily

902
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,240
agree with how they set up the model

903
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:16,439
because because you create the retail as

904
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,880
the gatekeeper right um but back back to

905
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,798
what I saying all you tier one and all

906
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,480
you tier twos you guys come together and

907
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:24,200
you start creating a Ruckus and you and

908
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,558
stop asking start demanding Co-op start

909
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,880
demanding you know uh Farmer Market

910
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,960
style situ start demanding where you can

911
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,840
actually bring in the customer or bring

912
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,720
in the person and educate them on what

913
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,199
you're doing right and the way that that

914
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,278
works is you guys all coming together

915
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,558
because you you know right now they

916
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,079
think they're all competition with each

917
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,839
other you know and it's like no no your

918
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,000
ship has some holes in it you need to

919
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,959
plug them up and the way you're going to

920
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,278
do that is teamwork right now whether

921
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,319
they do that or not but like as an

922
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:53,240
example you got ghost out there which is

923
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:55,638
from uh Kush Family original right that

924
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,159
guy is a beast when it comes to the 502

925
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:59,158
market right ghost OG

926
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:02,918
classic but the way he operates and

927
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,759
where he runs out there he's a beast

928
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,600
he's he's he's like quality in quality

929
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:10,000
out but it pulls no stops right will you

930
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:11,278
want to come at him with something he's

931
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,278
coming right back at you like as an

932
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,519
example one of the funniest things he

933
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:20,200
had one of the larg larger companies of

934
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:23,798
Fat Panda put up a post one time who's

935
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,120
better Fat Panda or Kush family and it

936
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:30,359
was bad it was on it was on their on

937
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:32,558
their post got ratioed right so so what

938
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:35,479
does ghost do dresses somebody up in a

939
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:38,440
panda outfit comes out of his house on a

940
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,599
video he's like you spying on me Panda

941
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,000
right and you can see the panda kind of

942
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:45,079
kind of peeking his head around the

943
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,558
corner but that kind of stuff in comedy

944
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,398
is hilarious now I think the camaraderie

945
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:51,720
between the two companies was awesome

946
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:53,918
because it made people laugh everybody

947
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,240
had a great time you know and they all

948
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,720
got they all got exposure of it of it

949
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,638
you know but that's where but also too

950
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,038
he backs it up he's like when the rosin

951
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:03,959
that he's putting on the market right

952
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:06,759
you know he's very critical about it so

953
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,319
so now there's a bunch of other other

954
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:10,720
people that have that exact same story

955
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,200
that are putting out a great you know

956
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,679
great product but they're getting

957
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,840
overshadowed because they don't have the

958
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,600
reach or or whatnot you know and uh and

959
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:21,638
so but yeah with with Washington in

960
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,879
particular is you have these groups that

961
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:27,439
say they're fighting for you MH but I

962
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,639
call them like they're the controlled

963
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,320
opposition yeah right you know and um

964
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,199
it's very telling right when they're

965
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,839
always asking you for money but they're

966
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,519
not doing anything but they're telling

967
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,480
you oh we're doing this or we're doing

968
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,839
that and you know speaking about on that

969
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,839
is like with those with those groups

970
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,240
right you got to really look into them

971
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,439
and see what they are doing for people

972
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,679
so that way you're not wasting your time

973
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,639
or wasting your money and also too I I

974
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,120
always tell people it cost 25 bucks 50

975
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:56,079
bucks run for city council right run for

976
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,199
something even if you don't think you're

977
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,038
going to win you might Sur surprise

978
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,519
yourself but what it does is if you take

979
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,119
votes from somebody they got to come and

980
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,120
they got to give you concessions they

981
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:06,239
got to you know that way you can say hey

982
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:09,118
if you're like I would love to see one

983
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,519
point in this country because we come in

984
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,760
numbers if we all stood together right

985
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,358
and was like you know what we're going

986
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,440
to stop this [ __ ] right now and we're

987
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:18,559
going to make them come give us

988
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,720
concessions because we have this people

989
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,599
that don't identify they might be a

990
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,838
republican might be a Democrat whatever

991
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,359
the hell it is right you have this

992
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,398
background but we're going to protect

993
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:29,398
this plan

994
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,279
and make sure you can't steal it from us

995
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,638
and and then that that translates and

996
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,079
starts flowing down to to the local

997
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,119
levels right that gives people the the

998
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,159
inspiration to also stand up like well

999
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,119
if they're saying something I'm going to

1000
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,838
say something right so it's it's weird

1001
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,159
as how this country works right you push

1002
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:45,878
push push push and then all of a sudden

1003
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,440
we push back and then the government

1004
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:49,319
like whoa whoa whoa slow down slow down

1005
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,079
you know right on a local level and even

1006
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,240
on a national level right but yeah

1007
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,839
that's where it comes to is is I always

1008
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,358
urge people work together get outside

1009
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,599
your comfort zone get outside of your

1010
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,838
box and and stop stop recognizing people

1011
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,039
that aren't your competition and that's

1012
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:08,519
actually uh you know your ally in this

1013
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,199
and then that way the people that are

1014
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:11,960
those groups that I just talked about

1015
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:13,039
have to do the right thing right right

1016
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,119
because all of a sudden the money will

1017
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,719
dry up or that group will form another

1018
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,960
group that will actually go fight for

1019
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:22,319
them right well so let's talk about uh

1020
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,720
something that's been a regular

1021
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,000
conversation with the last couple

1022
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,679
episodes which is uh descheduling or

1023
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,719
schedu more so resched what's your

1024
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:35,199
opinion on the the reschedule and

1025
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:39,759
deschedule so the so the dropping into

1026
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:42,199
schedule three MH right is a clear

1027
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,160
evidence that they are going to try to

1028
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:45,598
control this plant right right and what

1029
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,118
I mean by that is the schedule one they

1030
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,318
get all this covered they get to hide

1031
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,880
you know oh it's it's it's schedule one

1032
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:55,559
it's still legal but with the schedule

1033
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,559
three is bounces and keeps the ball in

1034
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:01,759
pharmaceutical Court right right okay um

1035
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,119
pharmaceutical industry and and uh and

1036
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,240
tobacco and alcohol are the three

1037
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,200
largest lobbies and everywhere things

1038
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,239
are going to go legal right they're the

1039
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,318
three largest lobbies that are on the no

1040
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,439
vote right that should tell you right

1041
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:15,679
because that means that it's going to

1042
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,679
hurt them in the pocket okay we all know

1043
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,039
cannabis helps a lot of people in a lot

1044
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,480
of ways right that information has been

1045
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,519
suppressed right so they're going to

1046
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,559
push and try so then what do they do

1047
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,039
Biden came out Biden and Democrats right

1048
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,358
this where they really screwed up they

1049
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,599
campaign on decriminalization right

1050
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,119
right then we get this bogus pardon

1051
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,480
right but uh you know but the real

1052
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,000
reason why that pardon came about wasn't

1053
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,519
to do the greater good for the country

1054
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,719
because it didn't got nobody out of jail

1055
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,880
what it was is they were getting ready

1056
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,598
and I even posted about it the day that

1057
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,760
that pardon dropped they're getting

1058
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,200
ready to do a deal with Russia to

1059
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,520
release a WNBA player in exchange for

1060
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,799
the most notorious arms dealer in human

1061
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:01,880
history right right that's not really

1062
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,440
good trait if you ask me you know right

1063
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,559
but but but aside from that they can say

1064
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,039
now because the grinder was was in jail

1065
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:13,159
for possession right which was a is was

1066
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,880
bogus and I think it was like nine years

1067
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,838
or something like that but you can't

1068
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,200
have the same Char same rules on your in

1069
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,920
your country right that you're

1070
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,039
advocating to get you know the the too

1071
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,000
harsh of a penalty Etc right but so that

1072
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,358
comes out they they he could have stroke

1073
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,039
of a pen yeah decriminalization we could

1074
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,239
have that right now right you know but

1075
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,559
the but the but that would mess up the

1076
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,279
total plan and that's then that's the

1077
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:41,000
total control of this plant because if

1078
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,319
the true every there's a few people that

1079
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,679
are in the noome but if the true

1080
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:46,800
properties and importance of this plant

1081
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:50,838
information actually came out it'd be a

1082
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,519
GameChanger in fact there was a tiny

1083
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:55,960
little snippet back in 2014 uh Medicare

1084
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:59,599
or Medicaid one of those two right in

1085
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,240
Washington alone saved $33 million right

1086
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,200
and that was because people forgoed

1087
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,078
their going to get their prescription

1088
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,960
and was hitting the dispensaries and I

1089
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,160
think that rang a bell to a lot of lot

1090
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,559
of these special interests right like

1091
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,358
well people are getting out of taking

1092
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:15,960
our pills we need to that's a problem

1093
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:19,039
that's a problem y right because right

1094
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,880
around that time um you had uh you know

1095
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:24,920
you had the CBD patent right by that was

1096
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,160
issued by the patent office for the

1097
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,318
human health services right now there's

1098
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,759
a long way about going about schedule 3

1099
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,039
but the way I see schedule 3 and the

1100
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,280
reason why it's going to schedule 3 is

1101
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,599
to give the what they consider the

1102
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,480
peasants the flower right and then they

1103
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,079
lock down the extraction because that's

1104
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,199
where the real medicinal aspect is this

1105
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,720
is is in the extractions M right and

1106
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,879
that's uh but then they can't come out

1107
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:50,118
and decriminalize because we live in a

1108
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,920
country that you know incarceration is a

1109
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,800
business you know you got to let a bunch

1110
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
of people out of out of jail you know um

1111
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,760
there's a lot of people in jail that

1112
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,560
shouldn't be in jail but for sure also

1113
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,040
too as a country we we have to take

1114
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:05,838
accountability on ourselves for not

1115
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,599
standing up the reason why the

1116
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,440
politicians don't do half the stuff we

1117
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,079
don't you know want them to do is

1118
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,240
because we don't push back on them right

1119
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,720
if you don't push back and they don't

1120
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,279
not forced to do it they're just not

1121
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,318
going to do it right but they what

1122
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,480
they'll do but one thing that I saw when

1123
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:23,679
when the news came out that they were

1124
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,960
going to move to schedule three is I saw

1125
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:29,239
people go well it's better than schedule

1126
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,960
one and it's like no it's not right and

1127
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,679
then and they're like it's virtually not

1128
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,838
going to change anything and you know

1129
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,358
it's pretty much legal now and it's like

1130
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,440
you got to look at the fine print right

1131
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,880
but what I just saw is is like I come

1132
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,800
from a time where it's fight ORF flight

1133
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,358
right and and I got the scars on my face

1134
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,079
because I always chose to fight and I

1135
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,358
think that's where we're losing in this

1136
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,920
country is we're losing the desire to

1137
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:55,119
fight but or we just haven't clicked on

1138
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,000
what to fight for yet right and that's

1139
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,160
where I think a lot of this is is

1140
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,318
boiling out to is I think people want to

1141
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:03,838
fight but they're been so suppressed and

1142
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:06,800
beat down that the incremental stuff

1143
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:09,078
like a bid and pardon or you know the

1144
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,119
the moving to schedule three is oh

1145
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,160
that's progress in reality it's

1146
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,358
virtually nothing well we as a society

1147
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,118
especially in the United States have

1148
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,920
become so fragile and soft over the last

1149
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,079
50 years especially and the other thing

1150
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,599
is like we're looking at symptoms rather

1151
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:26,800
than the causes of symptoms a lot of

1152
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,838
people see this and that's a symptom of

1153
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,000
a much bigger problem and we really need

1154
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,159
to start recognizing the problems rather

1155
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,358
than the symptoms it's cause and effect

1156
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:39,279
100% right so so you're going to you're

1157
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:41,000
going to go oh okay here's the effect

1158
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,519
I'm going to concentrate on this but I'm

1159
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,079
going to completely ignore the ca this

1160
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:46,199
is like it's just like you learn this in

1161
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,519
growing right so so you'll be like I got

1162
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,279
an issue with my plant maybe I got some

1163
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,559
bugs I'm going to spray it come back in

1164
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,760
the next day or two it's struggling then

1165
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,039
you go oh man it got worse but it's just

1166
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,079
it's just what you sprayed on it it's

1167
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:59,480
got recover from it right next thing you

1168
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,920
know you're going down this rabbit hole

1169
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,240
right and then you're digging in the

1170
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,920
soil all that stuff but when in reality

1171
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,519
if you would have just comprehensively

1172
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,119
taken a second and looked at it and go

1173
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,239
here's my plan is what I'm going to do

1174
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,318
to fix it right you wouldn't go down the

1175
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,679
rabbit hole so that's where I think a

1176
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:15,559
lot of people run into this is is like

1177
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,639
like they they they're so focused on the

1178
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:21,239
effect that they forget about the root

1179
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:23,440
cause and this comes back to in a lot of

1180
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:26,959
situations like even with with hemp

1181
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,200
right you know hemp hands down could

1182
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,400
almost create in my opinion world peace

1183
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,399
and and the way reason why I say that is

1184
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,960
because it would literally get us off

1185
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,960
the dependence of forign oil right right

1186
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,559
uh we would we would almost virtually

1187
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,960
replace plastic in a you know in just a

1188
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,119
number of years right we wouldn't have

1189
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,639
this big old huge uh patch in the middle

1190
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,160
of the Pacific Ocean that's choking out

1191
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:52,318
all their stuff right microplastics just

1192
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:55,960
the ground cover of a cover crop of hemp

1193
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:58,239
and the amount of you know uh the oxygen

1194
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,960
that would it would give then and the

1195
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,639
impurities I would suck out but also too

1196
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,480
the bio remediation of where that plant

1197
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:09,118
is but you got to look on the flip side

1198
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,960
there goes the petroleum industry right

1199
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,440
they're going to take a hit plastic

1200
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,159
right they're saying that they want to

1201
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,200
produce three or four more times the

1202
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,399
amount of plastic than we already

1203
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,519
produce today that's what they're

1204
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,240
projecting right that is crazy to me

1205
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:20,719
we're like where in the hell you going

1206
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,239
to put all this plastic right you know

1207
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,558
oh yeah it's going to go in that big old

1208
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,598
ocean there in the Pacific Ocean and

1209
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,920
swirl in a circle but also too you start

1210
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:32,200
digging into it right we had this back

1211
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:35,000
in 2018 2017 2018 we had this big old

1212
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:37,000
huge hemp that was coming on right and

1213
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,760
FDA came in and squashed it right why

1214
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,719
did the FDA come in and squash it right

1215
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,240
because people are now recognizing CBD

1216
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,358
really helps and this is a quick

1217
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,919
efficient way to get CBD yeah right

1218
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,318
people are beginning to put in water

1219
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,480
they're beginning to put in Foods they

1220
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,318
beginning to put in Edibles now that

1221
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,039
becomes a problem the pharmaceutical

1222
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,800
industry yeah right so the FDA is there

1223
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,838
to protect the pharmace itical industry

1224
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,079
it's supposed to be the other way around

1225
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,639
they're supposed to protect us from it's

1226
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,280
supposed to be right but when you really

1227
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:06,719
break it down and and anybody can fact

1228
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,680
check this 70% of FDA funding comes from

1229
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,318
the very people they're supposed to

1230
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,239
regulate right they're not going to go

1231
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:14,079
kick their gift horse in the mouth so if

1232
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:16,759
that if that those Industries say hey go

1233
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,440
curb this right they go we can curb this

1234
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,599
and we'll hide behind the DEA yeah right

1235
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,800
because de is anti everything right and

1236
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,079
that's just the way that they're set up

1237
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,280
no fault of their own that's what

1238
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,760
they're they're there for the

1239
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,040
enforcement so so you have the FDA that

1240
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
is a captured agency right you have all

1241
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,318
a lot of these agencies are captured

1242
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:39,559
agencies so as you start seeing the

1243
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,079
progress of these studies right the NIH

1244
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:43,440
right say you're scientist at NIH and

1245
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,000
you're you develop something you

1246
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,800
actually you actually get part of the

1247
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,920
patent you know so if you develop

1248
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,280
something and and when the NH develops a

1249
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,559
patent it goes from there straight to a

1250
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,680
pharmaceutical company but even though

1251
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:02,160
it's all taxpayer studied funded the

1252
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,879
whole nine yeah then the farmer takes it

1253
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,598
and they go well we're going to charge

1254
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,760
you 10 times 30 times 40 times 50 times

1255
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,039
the amount right and so when they do

1256
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,720
that that's why we have a seizure

1257
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:17,358
medication that costs

1258
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:19,399
$34,500 a year right that is just pure

1259
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:20,318
CBD oil in a country where your median

1260
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,358
income is

1261
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,960
$55,000 they just taxed a bunch of

1262
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:26,159
people that feel more comfortable in the

1263
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,000
pharmaceutical realm you can you can

1264
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,279
make this for pennies on the dollar

1265
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,280
right uh but if somebody puts that

1266
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,599
information out immediately discounted

1267
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,559
Etc all that you know but uh but what

1268
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:38,800
you see is is that's a small little

1269
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,160
glimpse of what this what this future

1270
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,640
looks like you have fiser that bought

1271
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:44,960
Arena pharmaceutics right um one of the

1272
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,480
main reasons why they bought Arena

1273
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,559
pharmaceutics because they their heart

1274
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,358
medication right you know uh but they

1275
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:54,519
were building they were they created a

1276
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:56,279
medication uh I think it's called Olan

1277
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:59,759
lab or or something similar to that that

1278
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,720
right is a CBG uh derived uh medication

1279
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,280
and it treats Crohn's disease yeah okay

1280
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:06,358
now people that suffer from Crohn's

1281
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,240
disease or suffer from seizures right

1282
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:11,639
any little bit of relief goes a long way

1283
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,479
with those folks right so now that

1284
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:15,838
medication when it hits the market it's

1285
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,039
going to be a $100,000 a year Market

1286
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,480
even though you could take some plants

1287
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,838
grow them in your yard and virtually

1288
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,318
make it yourself right that's the

1289
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:23,599
information they want to suppress that's

1290
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:24,960
why they want to that's why they want to

1291
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,119
knock the home grower out that's why

1292
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,240
they want to they want kneecap a lot of

1293
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,200
this this stuff and that's why I think

1294
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,919
hemp and cannabis relationship it has

1295
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:36,519
the ability to really change how we do

1296
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,119
stuff because cannabis and hemp will

1297
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,400
bring our jobs back it'll bring

1298
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:44,440
manufacturing back it'll make us a back

1299
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,880
again true power right we've lost a lot

1300
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,440
of power around the country this country

1301
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,119
they came over and the ropes on the boat

1302
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,318
were made of hemp you know it was even a

1303
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:56,480
law where you had to grow hemp right you

1304
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,679
know so so it's not like Reinventing the

1305
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,760
wheel here we just need to take control

1306
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:03,118
of the wheel again and the way I see

1307
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,400
that happening is is the people coming

1308
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,800
together the people talking people

1309
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,760
having these conversations getting this

1310
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,440
information out and if you're not mad

1311
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,960
you're not paying attention right you

1312
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,880
know I I go heavy in this because I'm

1313
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,400
passionate about this I have the love

1314
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,240
for this plant I have the love for the

1315
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,960
people that support inhouse support me

1316
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:22,399
support the people that are doing the

1317
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,240
good work out there you know like

1318
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,760
there's a guy out in Maine right mhm his

1319
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:29,639
name is sh

1320
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,000
and uh he went from just going and

1321
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:35,318
attending these committee meetings right

1322
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,838
then being vocal W then he really

1323
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:39,199
started gaining attraction then he goes

1324
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:41,639
and starts his own lobbying firm right

1325
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,000
now those same politicians have a fear

1326
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:44,960
of this man and I've watched this just

1327
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,280
happen just in the past two years and

1328
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,679
and he's he's I wouldn't say he's crazy

1329
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,680
but he's very passionate about what he

1330
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,279
does and that's what I when I see it I'm

1331
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,358
a big fan of him because I'm like that's

1332
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,720
what you're supposed to do you're

1333
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:58,239
supposed to speak truth to power right

1334
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,639
and if they're ignoring you you yell

1335
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,959
louder right you know and if you got to

1336
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:03,480
you know if you got to push it from

1337
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,960
there you keep pushing until they until

1338
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,000
they listen to you until they hear you

1339
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,240
you know and and I think we're getting

1340
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,318
to that point all that but in in my

1341
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,519
opinion though I think cannabis and hemp

1342
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:15,880
in itself could really have such an

1343
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,800
impact on this country and it would be

1344
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,358
the newest you Industrial Revolution

1345
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,280
that would make it far better far better

1346
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,039
world you know you know that's and

1347
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,000
that's just you know speaking honest

1348
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,039
it's like you and I in here

1349
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,679
totally so what's your opinion on the

1350
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,318
direction the Cannabis industry has kind

1351
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:36,239
of gone with everything being gelato

1352
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:38,358
purple candy gas and you know where do

1353
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,399
you see it going in the future this

1354
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:42,558
comes back to comes back to H Growers

1355
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,880
yeah right if you're a commercial Farm

1356
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,760
you have a license I would go back and

1357
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,079
support the home Growers hom Growers are

1358
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,640
going to protect and keep the genetic

1359
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,480
diversity they're going to be the key to

1360
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,440
the continued success of having the

1361
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,240
diversity because what you're going to

1362
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,358
have is you're going to have a lot of

1363
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:59,279
bigger companies and msos that are going

1364
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,799
to give you equivalent to what would be

1365
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,440
a Budweiser right the people that really

1366
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,880
want that are what do you call Legacy or

1367
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,599
people that really love the plan want to

1368
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,519
be in it they're going to be the micro

1369
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,440
Brewers of the world we already have

1370
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,000
this model where we could base it off of

1371
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,720
and that's the craft brew model people

1372
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,838
working together back during the 90s you

1373
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,639
had these shops that would pop up and

1374
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:22,279
you'd have five six seven eight Brewers

1375
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,960
in there Brewing different stuff as an

1376
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,280
example the reason why we have Ipa right

1377
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,639
now is because came from that movement

1378
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,519
right absolutely so so my lawyer right

1379
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,199
he owns he owns a couple stores there in

1380
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,679
Washington and and he used to think the

1381
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,558
home grer was competition to him and and

1382
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,759
I did a live one time and I and he comes

1383
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,640
from part of the Hops industry and and

1384
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,079
the beer industry and I explain that to

1385
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:45,679
people on a live one time and he called

1386
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,760
me up after he goes man you know he

1387
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,318
totally changed my mind on that you know

1388
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,160
right but that's what I'm saying is is

1389
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,400
is the road maps all the information is

1390
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:56,318
there yeah right so when I when I look

1391
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,880
at it is I go protect the homeg grower

1392
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,558
because that is going to be your line

1393
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,480
last line last line of defense when they

1394
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,359
come for you so there's like that

1395
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,400
there's that really famous poem right

1396
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,838
they came for me or they came for such

1397
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,240
and such I didn't say nothing they came

1398
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:10,639
for such and such I didn't say nothing

1399
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,118
when they came for me there was nobody

1400
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,598
to speak for me right you know there's

1401
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,720
more to it but it but it's the same way

1402
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:18,200
right money will money corrupts

1403
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,039
everything in this country so if you're

1404
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:21,480
in the way they're going to push you out

1405
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,798
the way unless they have some sort of

1406
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,599
resistance but yeah well when you when

1407
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:27,838
you get in U you know back to where

1408
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,039
saying earlier is go see what everybody

1409
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:31,960
else is doing right and start phasing in

1410
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:33,880
other stuff and find your lane once you

1411
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,960
find your Lane right then you're you're

1412
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,559
on you're on cruise control and nothing

1413
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,920
against you know people if they feel

1414
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,400
that's what they want to do or anything

1415
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,079
like that you know uh you know gelato

1416
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,079
this cookie that or whatever then that

1417
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,798
then carve out your own lane just be the

1418
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,720
best at it right you know and and

1419
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:52,679
present it and give it to the world but

1420
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,558
also too the world is going to tell you

1421
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,000
whether you're any good or not yeah

1422
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,880
right you're going to get real feedback

1423
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,639
yeah well feedback is critical like as

1424
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,240
an

1425
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:05,400
example the where like a lot of people

1426
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:07,838
Miss is like we mentioned earlier social

1427
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,200
media is such an important part of of

1428
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,039
what we Doh and you see these companies

1429
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:14,279
where they're like oh yeah I have a

1430
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:15,920
Facebook page I got a I got an Instagram

1431
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,760
but I don't really I don't really you

1432
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,280
know do much with it it's like you can't

1433
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,599
go and have a billboard you can't

1434
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,640
advertise anywhere you can't advertise

1435
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,798
there you can't interact with people

1436
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,558
right you know you can you know it goes

1437
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:31,519
a long way like as an example we get a

1438
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,280
lot of messages right I try to get

1439
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:34,519
through as many as possible Right but

1440
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,599
one of the cool things is once you hit

1441
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:37,559
up be like oh damn I didn't think I was

1442
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,838
going to get a response right you know

1443
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,319
and you're just passing information or

1444
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,838
or whatever the hell it is these

1445
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:47,400
companies need to more focus on the

1446
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:49,558
social media aspect of it but also too

1447
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,240
my my advice is you have a live button

1448
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:54,040
you have a video button it's really easy

1449
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:55,838
to now do you know somewhat of a

1450
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:56,880
production right it's not like you have

1451
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:59,318
to have a computer you don't have to

1452
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,280
have all this stuff right yeah take

1453
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:04,119
people on tours of your grow right or

1454
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,599
explain a situation or explain what

1455
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:09,039
you're doing because that way when they

1456
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,039
see your brand uh on the Shelf they go

1457
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:14,119
oh man I saw that guy or I saw those

1458
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:15,960
people there there's there's there's all

1459
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:17,599
of a sudden a connection there right you

1460
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,798
know you know people are going to grow

1461
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,720
what they're going to grow whatever you

1462
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:22,400
grow just be the best at it and put it

1463
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,639
out to the world and if it comes back

1464
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,440
negative you're going to have to switch

1465
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:28,679
it up yeah get feedback switch up figure

1466
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,400
out what uh what works for you what you

1467
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:34,919
like and what other people like as well

1468
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:37,079
hey feedback is scary to get yeah

1469
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,760
because you're so such a prideful person

1470
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,519
but I would say be open and receptive to

1471
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,760
it filter out the trolls filter out the

1472
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:46,519
BS right and find the people that are

1473
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,640
really critiquing you in a way that are

1474
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:49,759
going to that are going to make you a

1475
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,358
better person that's that's what the you

1476
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,880
want to focus on but if somebody says oh

1477
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,558
your shit's mids or you're trash or

1478
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,720
whatever forget about them you got to

1479
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,960
ignore those people cuz there's always

1480
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:58,399
going to be the naysayers there's going

1481
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,960
to be the people that are saying you

1482
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,280
can't be successful and you just got to

1483
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,480
push through figure out what works for

1484
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,839
you I think uh I can't wait for people

1485
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,639
to get some of these land race varieties

1486
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,000
back into the mix and some of these

1487
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:14,598
unique flavors I think diversity is the

1488
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,559
key I I love working with diverse stuff

1489
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,359
you know and I also but I also recognize

1490
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,720
what the market demands right now and

1491
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:22,759
what the market likes but you know even

1492
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,199
some of these old flavors that I grew up

1493
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,760
with that we haven't had for a long time

1494
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:27,399
I can't wait to see some of those hit

1495
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,559
the market again Romulan is another one

1496
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,639
it's like dude Romulan my story with

1497
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:34,559
Romulan was and there was this one guy

1498
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:37,239
me and my roommate and would meet and uh

1499
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:41,839
and he and he had the he had the Romulan

1500
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:43,959
that ounce right would leave a room and

1501
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:45,358
we're talking 30 minutes 45 minutes

1502
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,119
later you would think it was still in

1503
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:49,358
there oh yeah we just don't have that

1504
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,680
really anymore no and why do you think

1505
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:55,000
that is uh I think it's just um we've

1506
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:57,598
been in this Mad Dash to get uh the

1507
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,280
highest THC content right so I think

1508
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,680
that's a major factor which is obviously

1509
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,480
going to take away from the other canabo

1510
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:04,759
going to take away from tpine profiles

1511
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,838
right uh but when you mentioned land

1512
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,720
race right I'm excited that once the

1513
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:10,318
science starts coming out right some of

1514
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,439
these old people some of these you know

1515
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:12,599
people have been in it for a long time

1516
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,440
they still have these old seeds they're

1517
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:16,760
sitting on they're store right but I

1518
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,480
think everything goes in Cycles right

1519
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,000
and we'll start bringing it back and

1520
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,440
then uh that's one thing where I think

1521
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,159
hemp right hemp is going to be pretty

1522
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,880
critical because you if you have a high

1523
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:29,078
CBG plant right which is a mother of and

1524
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,039
and CBD right and you start uh start

1525
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:33,359
Crossing into that and back Crossing

1526
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,400
into that it may change and it you'll

1527
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,440
start getting more of a more of a canabo

1528
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,760
profile well Mojave Richmond told me

1529
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,760
something the other day a good friend of

1530
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,960
mine amazing guy that the the race is

1531
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,640
over when the seed leaves the land but

1532
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,280
the diversity is there and so that's

1533
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:49,920
what I love is all this diversity that

1534
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,200
we can throw in and finding new things I

1535
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,079
mean that's part of the reason I love

1536
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:55,679
breeding and I I love the selection

1537
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,680
process I love finding new things I'm

1538
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,358
always about discovering new things and

1539
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:02,598
new possibilities and that spe you know

1540
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:04,679
and one of the thing is is why I think

1541
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:06,720
the home Growers are extremely important

1542
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:10,759
because a commercial Farm isn't going to

1543
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:13,519
grow a low yielding plant no okay so a

1544
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,839
lot of a lot of magic and a lot of great

1545
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,559
things are found in the low yielding

1546
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,480
ugly plants yeah absolutely like like

1547
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,680
what I'm starting to see and we'll see

1548
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,838
if it how uh if it becomes something but

1549
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:28,199
uh but plants that are really extreme

1550
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,039
uh have the foxtailing trait you know

1551
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:33,399
not even stress induced trait but just

1552
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,239
fox tail uh now these now these washers

1553
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,880
are like that's what I want right

1554
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:39,479
because it's more surfaced you know

1555
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,880
right um but you go back a couple years

1556
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,358
everybody was like look at that trash

1557
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,358
it's FX stealing you know keep away

1558
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:47,960
whatever but it it's but it's like ever

1559
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:50,440
changing ever ever uh evolving you know

1560
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,358
but like there's some people right now

1561
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,920
that have strains that we thought we've

1562
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:55,838
lost forever they're just sitting on it

1563
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,400
it's like one there's a few trins to me

1564
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:01,440
that always hold dear right um I have

1565
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,400
one of the original or the world winning

1566
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,318
true OG right that plant will never

1567
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,480
never leave us you know and what I mean

1568
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:12,119
by that is is it'll go out out but I'll

1569
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,318
never lose that plant right um that's

1570
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,160
just because uh Derek from Elemental

1571
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:17,838
seeds you know rest in peace there's

1572
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,480
there's a lot of history there and you

1573
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:22,679
know uh from the Northwest and then I

1574
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,719
got this there's this other Gorilla Glue

1575
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:26,759
right that I that I pulled from another

1576
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,558
friend virus that it passed away right

1577
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,760
and it's just a phenomenal but so as

1578
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,119
much heat as a lot of some of these

1579
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,720
strains get right they'll never go away

1580
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,960
they'll always stay they'll always stay

1581
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:39,038
in in in rotation or stay in you know in

1582
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,679
our house but um but there's other

1583
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:41,920
people that have strains that are that

1584
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:43,919
are way older than that they're still

1585
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,639
keeping around and just rothering and

1586
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,880
and all of that so you'll see you know

1587
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,159
we'll see if we can keep up on the

1588
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,079
diversity but I think you're going to I

1589
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,279
think you're going to see people uh once

1590
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,359
there's a lot of more information come

1591
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,720
back they're going to start circling

1592
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:58,759
back around and being like let's get

1593
00:55:55,719 --> 00:56:01,038
this THC back to back into the low 20s

1594
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,520
let's bring this CBD back up you know

1595
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,720
Flor back yeah flavor yeah we there's

1596
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,599
going to be flavors that we'll probably

1597
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:09,759
come across that we didn't even think

1598
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,039
was was possible especially with that

1599
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,160
with that many uh tpin and that

1600
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,240
information coming everything is is

1601
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:17,879
information and one thing about that

1602
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,558
plant is it's resilient just when you

1603
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:23,559
think you have it dialed in it's like n

1604
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,319
no right I'm throwing you a curve ball

1605
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:27,280
well I think some of the pro problems

1606
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:29,920
we're having with like hlate and verid

1607
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,798
could be due to you know breeding

1608
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,280
depression from all the gelato so we

1609
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:35,079
need to get stuff back in there that's

1610
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,119
diverse to get some more Vigor into the

1611
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:39,599
plants to get them healthier but uh it's

1612
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:41,760
really interesting we weren't even

1613
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,200
talking about viruses I know I mean to

1614
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,039
cut you up I know you talk a lot about

1615
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:48,358
that on your and I'd love to get your

1616
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:51,200
opinion on this yeah it's not new right

1617
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:54,000
okay there's a whole industry mhm hop

1618
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,639
industry right done ton of research on

1619
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,119
this right right

1620
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:00,519
why do we not know this inside and out

1621
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:02,720
right you know okay MH if the Hopkin

1622
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:05,318
live with it right and the cannabis

1623
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,558
plant is a cousin of it yeah right well

1624
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:08,279
what's the what's the genetic marker

1625
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,240
that's allowing that to happen right

1626
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,680
what's the what's the process of this

1627
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:14,038
there's there's so many of these

1628
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,118
variables and and one thing that I see

1629
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:19,760
is is like it's a real thing okay yeah

1630
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,160
but it's not the end all end all because

1631
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,280
we if you've grown for any certain

1632
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:26,960
amount of time I remember when basically

1633
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,559
aphids was like oh my gosh you know

1634
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,079
right now you just killing that with

1635
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:34,440
Dawn soap right okay if you've ever deal

1636
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:38,119
look I'll tell you these these the broad

1637
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:40,000
M and the russet might those are spawns

1638
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:41,358
of the devil from Hell right and I

1639
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,920
remember it used to be that used to be a

1640
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,598
death sentence right absolutely and

1641
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,240
you're like oh you know the solutions

1642
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,280
were so easy though that's the thing is

1643
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,078
like yeah especially russet mites it's

1644
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,119
like I thought I thought life was over

1645
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,280
when we first got russet mites yes but

1646
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:56,160
what it took yeah was a homeg grower

1647
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,119
going hey this is what I did yeah right

1648
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:01,078
this is how I this how I we got some

1649
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:03,519
sulfur micro dispers look you can have

1650
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:06,640
you can have 10,000 people work on

1651
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:09,358
something right you know or you can be

1652
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:11,920
an ass and try to curb out an additional

1653
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,440
100,000 or 200,000 people that are going

1654
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,318
to work on something right you know what

1655
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,960
I'm saying right and that's why you know

1656
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:20,000
I'll always harp on how important the

1657
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,639
homeg grower is because I think I think

1658
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,519
that VI that virid will be solved by

1659
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,879
some guy growing in his thr in his tent

1660
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,440
right now that's got it and it's going

1661
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,599
to try to find a solution yeah well I

1662
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,599
think there's there's a bunch of things

1663
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,359
that play in my opinion uh it's not just

1664
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,640
one virus we have hop plon that we talk

1665
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,920
about but there's so many other

1666
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,558
pathogens that we're not talking about

1667
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,240
that are contributing to the problem but

1668
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:45,039
also hopl there's so many different

1669
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:48,078
forms of hot it's not just one thing

1670
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:50,480
it's not one there there's definitely a

1671
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,559
variance of hop plon just like there is

1672
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,119
of Co and everything else and some of

1673
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,200
them are worse than others and I believe

1674
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,559
they have ident identified plants that

1675
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:01,038
are resistant to it uh something with

1676
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,280
the anthocyanins yes but yeah it's it's

1677
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,000
real interesting U Kevin mckernin from

1678
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,720
medicinal genomics they've identified

1679
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,480
some stuff and and other people as well

1680
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:11,598
and I think you're right that we will be

1681
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,280
able to figure out what works with

1682
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,039
hoplite and what doesn't we'll be able

1683
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,160
to identify you know how to breed that

1684
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:20,440
you know stuff that's resistant to it

1685
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,759
but also we need to be able to test

1686
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,960
genetic material to find out if it has

1687
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:27,359
problems because then we just don't need

1688
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,159
by that is is people way smarter than us

1689
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:31,759
right and way that are not just Growers

1690
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:33,440
but also have the background right and

1691
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,359
we'll figure out a solution I just want

1692
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,720
to be very clear on that it's just like

1693
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:38,598
you're not throwing you're not throwing

1694
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,000
things at a wall to see what sticks but

1695
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:42,280
when you look at the grow Community

1696
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,318
himself there is some of the most

1697
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,680
intelligent people and that's why that's

1698
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:47,838
why I always find it really weird when

1699
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,679
they when people be like oh this stigma

1700
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,400
of the Stoners and this and that because

1701
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,000
some of the some of the best Growers

1702
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,880
some of the brightest people

1703
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,440
unfortunately get to interact with on a

1704
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,440
regular basis through through social

1705
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,318
media and that's where ultimately like I

1706
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,880
said is is that's where the problems get

1707
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:05,440
solved and you know on the commercial

1708
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,400
side of stuff if I was a commercial

1709
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,679
grower I would tap into the hom grower

1710
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,639
right I would find the people that love

1711
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:15,598
hunting and go you know what I'm going

1712
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:18,159
to just keep you flush with packs keep

1713
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:21,200
hunting it find the best one send it to

1714
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:22,838
me and this is this is now your your job

1715
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,239
you know you need to come to my facility

1716
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:27,279
all that stuff because you know there's

1717
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:29,479
so much talent out there and so many

1718
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,359
people that all he like to do all Z love

1719
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,079
to do is hunt you know and you know you

1720
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:36,000
tap into that because you know how

1721
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,400
danger it is to hunt in a commercial

1722
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
facility because you got a you got a ton

1723
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,760
ton of variables there you got a ton of

1724
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,679
ton of issues you know but yeah it sucks

1725
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,000
that uh we're in the thick of it but

1726
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:47,838
it's like anything that we've

1727
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,719
encountered before it's not a matter of

1728
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,719
if it's a matter when we find the

1729
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:53,159
solution now some of the solutions are

1730
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:55,118
going to come in the vi of the way of

1731
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:56,399
snake oil right and there's going to

1732
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,960
come other solutions that going to come

1733
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,119
in in a true viable solution you know

1734
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,960
and also too if the first time it

1735
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,039
doesn't work try something else but keep

1736
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,119
trying never stop trying you know and

1737
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,680
you know you you'll eventually get there

1738
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,240
but it's a it's just tragic because it's

1739
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,000
a it's a big thing it will continue to

1740
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:15,439
be a big thing and it's devastating a

1741
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,880
lot of people in the process yeah and I

1742
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,760
think things like sour diesel that we

1743
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,400
thought just got weak we didn't even

1744
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,039
really understand what was happening was

1745
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,039
one of the early vectors of hop plate

1746
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:27,119
and viroid and

1747
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,920
you know I remember Sour Diesel as being

1748
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,318
this amazing thing and it had been years

1749
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,838
I just I showed you some Sour Diesel

1750
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:34,159
that I got earlier but it had been years

1751
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:37,038
since I actually saw a real cut of Sour

1752
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:38,759
Diesel but that's mostly because

1753
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,960
everyone switched over from growing sour

1754
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:44,760
diesel to Gorilla Glue especially in

1755
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,159
California in somoma mesino and humble

1756
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,440
because the sour had problems and also

1757
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:51,838
it was a longer flowering the Gilla glue

1758
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,920
in some ways was Superior as far as

1759
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,639
harvest although the chps I mean now now

1760
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,559
yeah name your price if you got good

1761
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:59,679
Sour Diesel well back to back to what we

1762
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,278
were talking about earlier you know if

1763
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,000
you got a 10 weer more people commercial

1764
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:05,920
Farms aren't going to grow it time real

1765
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,760
estate is expensive in the commercial

1766
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,400
Market okay absolutely uh so you know

1767
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,480
when it comes to that diversity but also

1768
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,240
going through those steps and trying to

1769
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,639
figure out how you're going to fix that

1770
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:17,199
and correct that it's hlvd today it's

1771
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:19,000
going to be something tomorrow right

1772
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,639
right and uh there always going to be

1773
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,798
something on the horizon yeah in my

1774
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,000
opinion I wish it would did at this

1775
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:27,079
point it would go to university stud

1776
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
yeah right an unbiased Universal

1777
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:31,318
University study and that way you get

1778
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,119
the full picture of it right and

1779
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:35,119
unbiased cuz like we have a great

1780
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,880
program up where up in the Northwest at

1781
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,079
at udub yeah right in fact the udub hash

1782
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:43,480
plant is how we created the Platinum

1783
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:47,480
right wow uh so udub has had a has had a

1784
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:48,639
cannabis program for 25 years you know

1785
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,719
uh but you know something like that

1786
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:54,038
that's equipped that University of uh

1787
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:57,078
Mississippi um which has actually been

1788
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:58,880
uh they've been studying cannabis for 55

1789
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:01,119
years they get a ton of money from from

1790
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,318
the government so that all mean when

1791
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,119
they say they're not studying it they're

1792
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:05,679
lying to you right right that was one of

1793
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:07,079
the arguments about a schedule three no

1794
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,519
we get to study it and like no they're

1795
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:12,640
just choosing not to or not necessarily

1796
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:16,079
fullon full fledged but out of that just

1797
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:18,440
like hops you'd get a solution right and

1798
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,318
uh and so until we get there it just you

1799
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,039
have a private sector right that's

1800
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:24,639
working on it private sector is

1801
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,760
for-profit yeah right and ultimately

1802
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:28,199
ended up in a gatekeeper situation right

1803
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,960
you know like we talked about fireman

1804
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:32,679
earlier it's the same thing like I mean

1805
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,358
as crazy as sounds they're I think

1806
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:36,598
there's plenty of cures right but I

1807
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:39,199
think what they do to it they do this

1808
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:41,640
jelv it right because it you know ain't

1809
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,960
no money in cures yeah right you know

1810
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:46,038
keep them keep them coming keep them

1811
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,440
turning yeah and uh and I just hope that

1812
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:48,599
cannabis doesn't go by that Wayside

1813
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,599
where it's like oh we'll sell you the

1814
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,960
solution but we're going to sell you the

1815
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:55,519
treatment right you know not the actual

1816
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,679
solution of it you know know but that's

1817
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:59,079
commerci commercialization of everything

1818
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:02,239
in this country and and and how it

1819
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:04,039
shakes out and you know the cool part is

1820
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:05,759
is you're not going to stop learning

1821
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:07,680
right you're you're going to see it the

1822
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,278
the reason why I don't talk about it in

1823
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,480
depth is because just like everybody

1824
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:13,838
else I'm learning more about it yeah I'm

1825
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,119
learning from people that are way

1826
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:16,880
smarter than me and seeing what they're

1827
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,278
having to say about it and then

1828
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,358
continuing doing doing my research on

1829
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:23,760
the on the subject I like that you bring

1830
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,400
it up quite a bit you know and talk to

1831
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,000
just about guest about it to get their

1832
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,000
get their opinion you know you get a

1833
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,199
little snippet of of good information

1834
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,960
from a lot of folks that you've talked

1835
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,239
to in the past yeah and there's so much

1836
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,039
information out there and so many

1837
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:38,399
opinions on it and you know and that

1838
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:40,278
goes with everything yeah well opin look

1839
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,960
if you don't talk to people yeah right

1840
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:43,318
you ain't gonna learn nothing you know

1841
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,720
yeah I mean I've learned so much from

1842
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:48,759
doing this show uh from from the guests

1843
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:51,838
and we have so many people that are

1844
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,240
smart uh in their own right in in what

1845
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:55,078
and they specialize in certain things

1846
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:56,919
like Reggie from Steve steill you know

1847
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,559
originally from Steep Hill he's at Front

1848
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,079
Range biosciences now but you know that

1849
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,400
was a great podcast I learned a lot of

1850
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,880
stuff gu highly intelligent extremely

1851
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,798
good at what he does also too what I

1852
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,880
really liked about that particular one

1853
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:11,038
was when he conveyed the information he

1854
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,760
conveyed it in a way where a vast

1855
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,039
majority of people understood yeah right

1856
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,039
didn't get too technical with it right

1857
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,400
you could sit here and you get real

1858
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:20,599
technical with a lot of stuff right but

1859
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,599
it gets Lost in Translation a lot of

1860
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:25,240
phds can't break it down so everybody

1861
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,760
understands I think what you should do

1862
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:29,919
is create a third chair yeah so that way

1863
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,160
when the PHD says something you got the

1864
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,680
person that'll break it down for the

1865
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:35,118
people at home to you know I'm just

1866
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,558
messing with you like like speaking

1867
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:39,680
about phds doctors right like uh like

1868
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,599
right now there's a there's a there's a

1869
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:44,558
lady at of organ that I'm a huge fan of

1870
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:47,278
and it's her name's uh maib Shields yes

1871
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,960
okay she gets on there she she got a

1872
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:50,639
story right she's like this is how I

1873
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,318
took care of myself so you know what I'm

1874
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:54,639
going to do I'm going to explain my

1875
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:57,000
journey and what I did right and if it

1876
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:58,960
helps you cool if not at least you learn

1877
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,278
something along the way right so when I

1878
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,679
see her posters her stories or post post

1879
01:06:02,278 --> 01:06:06,159
I I make a point to put it in our story

1880
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:08,399
right because I feel it's what people

1881
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,118
need to see yeah there's another guy out

1882
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,480
there that's an actual medical doctor

1883
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:15,760
rashan Hajj right so he had a family

1884
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:18,400
practice but also too he's the one that

1885
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,920
I was watching him on on a on a podcast

1886
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,200
and he's the one that really went in

1887
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,519
depth about the CB1 and CB2 receptors

1888
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:25,919
and how they fill up also

1889
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:28,480
gives you a little bit of background in

1890
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,960
how pharmacology works right right and

1891
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,240
he had a family practice so he wasn't

1892
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,159
beholden to have to pump people up with

1893
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,598
anti-depressants this and that like

1894
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:39,278
that's one thing that we didn't touch on

1895
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:41,440
but even with hemp and cannabis right I

1896
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:43,639
think that there's a solution there to

1897
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:47,920
be had when it comes to anti-depressants

1898
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:49,879
yeah they be and then also to ADHD right

1899
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,680
um finding that combination what it's

1900
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,400
going to take to get there is the key is

1901
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:55,358
is the key factor to it but I think

1902
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,920
that's there there's a there's a there's

1903
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,239
a solution to that I think there's

1904
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,358
potential Solutions out there with

1905
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:03,038
psychedelics as well they haven't been

1906
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:04,920
explored and and they will be explored

1907
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,599
but I think it's like uh it's going to

1908
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,798
have to be us to be vocal about it to

1909
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,440
say hey we want to at least try this

1910
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:10,960
because when it comes to a lot of people

1911
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,838
understand when it comes to

1912
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,960
anti-depressants and ADH medication it

1913
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:16,798
changes your brain chemical makeup it

1914
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,838
literally over time changes it I've gone

1915
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:20,440
to the doctor for a checkup yeah and the

1916
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:22,759
doctor starts asking me hey how you

1917
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,039
feeling right I'm feeling all right uh

1918
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,278
you know sometimes stressful he's like

1919
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,359
how many stress days you have all this

1920
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:32,159
stuff right yeah I'm like man I don't

1921
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:33,558
know like I you know you got your good

1922
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:36,719
days you got your bad days and all that

1923
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:39,278
stuff right and uh somehow my medical

1924
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,480
records ended up putting on where I had

1925
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:41,838
at some point a prescription for

1926
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,119
anti-depressant so I was like so if I

1927
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:45,199
came into the hospital incapacitated you

1928
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:47,000
guys would have pumped me through full

1929
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,000
of these you know right oh yeah you know

1930
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,119
it's like but it it just goes to show

1931
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,400
how easy it is not to say that it's not

1932
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,400
effective not to say that it doesn't

1933
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,838
help people yeah but I think the at the

1934
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,720
rate that it is prescribed to people I

1935
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,960
think there's alternatives for people

1936
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:00,639
they don't necessarily have to have to

1937
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,960
go that route and that's where I think

1938
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:06,078
the Cannabis hemp and that aspect coming

1939
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,720
out will keep people off the dependency

1940
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:11,240
of drugs and also too right we have a

1941
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:13,358
heroin fentanyl crisis oh yeah right

1942
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:14,838
they shown great results and on helping

1943
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:16,640
people with that because when you're

1944
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:19,798
coming off of that the biggest fear for

1945
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,039
people right is the pain that that

1946
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:23,880
you're going to go through well part of

1947
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:25,600
the problem with medicine you know

1948
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,640
Western medicine especially is that we

1949
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,640
want to put it all in a nice little box

1950
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,640
but our body chemistries are so unique

1951
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,920
and so different that what works for one

1952
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,560
person doesn't always work for the next

1953
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,798
you know and we're starting to

1954
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,960
understand uh you know as far as

1955
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:43,560
genetics and you know inherit inherited

1956
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,838
problems but these body chemistries are

1957
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,159
so unique to the individual that we as

1958
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:50,880
individuals need to understand that we

1959
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:52,559
need to try different things potentially

1960
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,920
and try multiple different things to

1961
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,759
understand medicine for ourselves you

1962
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,000
know so we have to take steps for

1963
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:00,079
ourselves as

1964
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,399
individuals which you know the

1965
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:03,640
government and not not just the

1966
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:05,960
government but doctors in general want

1967
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,400
to classify you as a certain way and you

1968
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:11,759
need this this and this and they have a

1969
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:13,318
sop based on this and it's not always so

1970
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:16,158
cut and dry and that's the beauty of

1971
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:17,480
using cannabis and you know psychedelics

1972
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,719
for all these things but they're really

1973
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:21,759
hard for doctors to quantify understand

1974
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:24,279
your medical history and your family

1975
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,759
history right is a is a great and huge

1976
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:28,520
start because I think when you see the

1977
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:31,000
basically CHS and a few other things

1978
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,759
coming on right I think if you have a

1979
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
onset in your family or yourself of

1980
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:37,000
psychosis yeah this is going to trigger

1981
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,960
it not a matter of if it's a matter when

1982
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,560
right so you have to always factor that

1983
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:44,798
in right uh the uh but also other other

1984
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,759
other uh medical issues that you that

1985
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,719
you might have so yes it's education and

1986
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:51,439
I think that's you know where a lot of

1987
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:54,198
this stuff comes uh up short is the lack

1988
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:55,479
of education and people some sometimes

1989
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:57,198
maybe they don't want to feel like

1990
01:09:55,479 --> 01:09:59,519
they're out like you know they're afraid

1991
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:01,319
to ask or afraid to talk about it you

1992
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,000
know uh better the more people talk

1993
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:05,039
about it quicker and faster you're going

1994
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,198
to get a solution you know but you have

1995
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,359
to understand your body you have to

1996
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:10,719
understand yourself you have to

1997
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:12,960
understand you know uh your your also

1998
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,198
your family history you know that way

1999
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,880
that way you can make adjustments that's

2000
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:19,359
just anything in life when it comes to

2001
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:21,359
when it comes to U medical aspects of it

2002
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:24,238
yeah I mean I have a very open doctor

2003
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,198
he's open to hearing all my crazy ideas

2004
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:29,678
and tells me which ones are crazy but we

2005
01:10:26,198 --> 01:10:31,678
have a very open uh relationship as far

2006
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,600
as conversations I can I can have a good

2007
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,880
conversation about why I use this or why

2008
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,120
I use that I have Crohn's and I have

2009
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,440
aler of colitis they're both in

2010
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:42,158
remission right now but uh it's really

2011
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,359
interesting because if you don't have a

2012
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,119
doctor like that you should find a

2013
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:47,198
doctor if if you enjoy cannabis

2014
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,880
especially that you can have that real

2015
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:51,919
conversation with your doctor about why

2016
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,600
you use it or you know or alternative

2017
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,679
medicine you I'm a huge fan of

2018
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,840
alternative medicine so it's yeah it and

2019
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:01,239
it sucks when you when you when it gets

2020
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:04,000
the terminology of that right because

2021
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:06,359
when it comes to Nature right that's

2022
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,079
where all solutions are is in nature

2023
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:09,519
okay where we run into a problem when it

2024
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,760
comes to medication is when you

2025
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,600
synthesize it yeah right synthetics do

2026
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,600
not do well in the human body well

2027
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,079
there's synthetic food I mean Foods too

2028
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,000
processed foods synthetic processed

2029
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:20,920
foods like like I saying is is that's

2030
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,479
what I was saying earlier cannabis is

2031
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,520
safest one of the safest if not the

2032
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:26,119
safest product on Market when it comes

2033
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:29,120
to something that you're going to ingest

2034
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:31,119
right because our food is sprayed with

2035
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:33,559
all Roundup everything else well with

2036
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,559
that said though is is like yeah the if

2037
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,080
you know if you had hemp that was say

2038
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,440
running you know grown wild right that

2039
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:39,800
means the cows are going to eat it that

2040
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:41,439
means that that those cannaboids are

2041
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,679
going to be in the meat that you eat

2042
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:45,399
right but when but as when you look at

2043
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,480
history right when we started doing

2044
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:50,519
processed foods right high fructose corn

2045
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:52,439
syrup is terrible for you right uh and

2046
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,040
you know it's more worse than than the

2047
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:56,559
alternative right when your solution is

2048
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:59,079
worse than you know your new thing is

2049
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,320
worse than what it was before right but

2050
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:02,719
uh but that's how you're able to capture

2051
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:04,679
a lot of stuff Plus at the time when

2052
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,520
they went to high fructose corn syrup we

2053
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:09,158
had a big huge sugar situation down

2054
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:11,239
south you know there's a lot of politics

2055
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,399
that go into reasons why we have things

2056
01:12:11,238 --> 01:12:15,319
the way that they are you know but uh

2057
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:18,119
but yeah when it comes to when it comes

2058
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:20,158
to that is is nature in itself will heal

2059
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:21,679
itself that's why even with um like

2060
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,799
whether which side of the fence people

2061
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,760
fall on global warming or you know

2062
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,360
choking our oceans with the plastic I

2063
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,639
can tell you one thing Mother Earth is

2064
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:33,000
going to correct it it's either with us

2065
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:35,199
or without us it does not matter because

2066
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,399
that's not going to stop right you know

2067
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:38,879
so that's where you know we have to kind

2068
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:40,719
of look at a lot of this stuff and and

2069
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,600
stop treating this planet in a sense

2070
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,520
like we have another place to go yeah

2071
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,520
you know but uh but you got to protect

2072
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,560
nature because we're going to lose stuff

2073
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,920
that is going to be critical for this

2074
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,800
Generations future generations and Etc

2075
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,960
and that's just a normal you know die

2076
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,639
off of of certain things but you know I

2077
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,158
think everything that's that we have an

2078
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:00,520
issue right now we could we could find a

2079
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:03,679
solution in nature I think that the

2080
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:06,080
first actual I guess would be cannabis

2081
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,960
or cannabis death you know contributed

2082
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:11,158
would be a synthetic product kind of

2083
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:13,439
simar like how the what the Flocka or

2084
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:15,599
whatever synthetic cannaboids would make

2085
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,079
people go crazy all that stuff right but

2086
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,320
the news is going to completely gloss

2087
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:21,319
over that fact and just attack the plant

2088
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:23,399
itself even though the plant didn't do

2089
01:13:21,319 --> 01:13:26,359
anything because by itself it's an

2090
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,799
amazing thing you know and I think to a

2091
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:30,799
degree with our breeding we're screwing

2092
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,840
it up that it's in its natural Hab

2093
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,639
inhabitants that's where it thrives and

2094
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,360
does the best as far as medicine but uh

2095
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:38,639
you know that's just I disagree on that

2096
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,279
and and the reason why I disagree on

2097
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:43,239
that is because we're constantly

2098
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:44,719
learning and evolving right just take

2099
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:46,959
yourself as an example from what I've

2100
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,520
saw today what talking to you and your

2101
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,840
plans and what you're looking to do

2102
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,040
right to me that that says you're on a

2103
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,840
great path you're bringing bringing it

2104
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:59,479
back the other way you recognized now

2105
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,360
where it was going so you go you know

2106
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:03,959
what I'm going to steer the ship over to

2107
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:05,439
this way right you know so so when you

2108
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,480
see that you're not alone there's a lot

2109
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,638
of people that also witnessed that and

2110
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:11,959
seen that right yes we we went down this

2111
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:14,359
crazy path right you know that path is

2112
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,679
now we're starting to see you know the

2113
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:17,158
wall at the end of that path so we got

2114
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:19,119
to kind of you know turn it out of that

2115
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:22,039
and I think you myself a lot of these

2116
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,519
people around are seeing the writing on

2117
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:25,399
the wall and hearing what people are

2118
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,239
saying and going to you know going to

2119
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:31,759
correct the ship but but it comes to

2120
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:33,799
where we don't care in a sense whether

2121
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,039
it's sanctioned or not we're going to do

2122
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,760
it anyway you know right and I think

2123
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:41,119
that's what what scares a lot of the

2124
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,960
powers that be is like well we can't get

2125
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,920
rid of it because they'll just take it

2126
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,679
back underground you know like as an

2127
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:49,279
example when um when everybody when the

2128
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,239
I don't want to say the name or what

2129
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,238
about it but you know when they told

2130
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,359
everybody to go home and stay there

2131
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,799
right until further notice

2132
01:14:54,359 --> 01:15:00,238
the states were so greedy that they were

2133
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:02,199
like keep the dispensaries open it

2134
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,678
wasn't because they was for your greater

2135
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:07,479
good they didn't want that tax money to

2136
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:09,239
stop rolling right you know absolutely

2137
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:10,959
especially in Washington right you know

2138
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,839
so there they're not there for your for

2139
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,760
your greater good you know so that's

2140
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,679
where you're kind of like um you know

2141
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,199
when you start seeing all this all this

2142
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:21,239
stuff and coming in and and you're

2143
01:15:18,198 --> 01:15:23,479
recognizing it but I I'm really you know

2144
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:25,718
huge fan and especially after what I s

2145
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:27,839
today and the direction you're going I'm

2146
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:29,679
I'm super excited to to see where you

2147
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,719
where you go with that you know I don't

2148
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,399
want to go into depth with it cuz I

2149
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:35,399
don't know if it's if it's a secret or

2150
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:38,920
not but I'm pretty stoked about it I try

2151
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:40,119
to be as transparent as possible for the

2152
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,760
most part I mean yeah there's some

2153
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,679
formulas and stuff that we're working on

2154
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,280
and and things that we're doing that you

2155
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,639
know we keep under reps but the like

2156
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:49,279
just like with my book there's no

2157
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:51,239
secrets in my book it's like I tell

2158
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:53,479
everybody what I I do and what I'm doing

2159
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:55,718
and it I try to put as much authentic

2160
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:57,399
information out there as possible so

2161
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:59,600
that the little guy can compete with the

2162
01:15:57,399 --> 01:16:03,079
big guy that's that's part of what I

2163
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,480
think is valuable where I think us

2164
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:06,359
together we're not competing against

2165
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,839
each other we're you know competing

2166
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:10,960
against big Pharma and other things like

2167
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:14,520
that you you know you could you could uh

2168
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:16,600
argue but uh I think the biggest thing

2169
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,239
is authenticity too like yeah I don't

2170
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,920
think like when it comes to when it

2171
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,439
comes to competition right like we can

2172
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,239
do the exact same thing we can still be

2173
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:24,198
friends yeah right you're going to get

2174
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:25,238
I'm going to get one you know we're

2175
01:16:24,198 --> 01:16:27,119
going to we're going to do this exchange

2176
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:28,559
to go back and forth one thing is is

2177
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,399
like especially with in- house in

2178
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,360
particular yeah we don't will never see

2179
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:35,399
us knock somebody else's work or what

2180
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:37,119
they're doing or anything like that now

2181
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:38,879
you if you're a terrible person or

2182
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:40,399
whatever right okay then that's a little

2183
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,679
bit different but when it comes to

2184
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:45,238
people's work right you'll never see a

2185
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:46,440
knock come from come from that direction

2186
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:48,039
that's just because we're a fan of the

2187
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:50,599
plant we're a fan of the people we're a

2188
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:52,920
fan of what what people do you know and

2189
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:54,800
so the same sentiment along your lines

2190
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,119
right so when I see what you're doing I

2191
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,600
don't look it as competition I don't

2192
01:16:56,119 --> 01:17:00,158
look like if you're behind or if you're

2193
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,679
ahead right I'm like pretty stoked I got

2194
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,399
this now I got this direct connection

2195
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,158
with this person I'm going to be in the

2196
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:07,599
loop with what he's doing I get to share

2197
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:10,158
my information so on and so on and

2198
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,120
ultimately that end results as they you

2199
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,399
know start to come out as a better

2200
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:16,559
situation not just for us but everybody

2201
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,519
else that's that's around exactly and we

2202
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,080
want to be gortex we're not trying to be

2203
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,520
Nike all the these other things I want

2204
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,800
to collaborate with people I want to

2205
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,639
work with other people and you know at

2206
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,639
at the end of the day when you break it

2207
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:29,679
down we're just stewards of the plant

2208
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:33,000
and hopefully we're putting it in a good

2209
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:35,440
direction yeah well the I like some

2210
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,560
aspects and some I'm against but the the

2211
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:40,158
direction of the core of people and the

2212
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,880
way that uh you know that the the core I

2213
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,559
guess a core group of people I really

2214
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:46,480
like that direction because it's a core

2215
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,480
of Fighters it's a core of people that

2216
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,718
that come from a you know come from a

2217
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:52,158
history there there's there's that

2218
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,760
there's that Dynamic and so that gives

2219
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:56,079
me great hope that like hey you know

2220
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,239
when when push comes to shove you're

2221
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,920
going to get shoved and you know and if

2222
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:01,399
the if it comes to getting you know

2223
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,158
having to slap somebody in the mouth you

2224
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:04,839
know right whether it's the FDA or

2225
01:18:03,158 --> 01:18:06,679
whoever it is you're going to have the

2226
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:09,239
power of the people to back you to to do

2227
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:10,960
that you know and so like uh you know

2228
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:13,479
that's one thing is like even when I was

2229
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,198
touched a bit on the FDA right all the

2230
01:18:13,479 --> 01:18:18,678
people that head the FDA when they leave

2231
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:21,198
the FDA 61st day they're sitting on a

2232
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:24,359
board of a pharmaceutical company yeah

2233
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:27,000
that is crazy that should be illegal

2234
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:28,119
there's you know I don't mind I never

2235
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,359
talk down on somebody getting their

2236
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:33,198
money right but at the same time that's

2237
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:34,158
that that is crazy you know right just

2238
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:36,319
the same people you're supposed to

2239
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:38,079
regulate now you work for them right you

2240
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:40,679
know that that kind of that kind of

2241
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,600
thing but so as far as us being stewards

2242
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:46,000
I feel like there's a big responsibility

2243
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,719
for us to do good with it but also we're

2244
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,279
working on the shoulders of a lot of the

2245
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:50,760
people that came before us it's like a

2246
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:53,039
lot of the breeding work has been done

2247
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,199
over the last you know couple hundred

2248
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:57,158
years I mean we're refining it in a way

2249
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:58,879
that they didn't do but a lot of the

2250
01:18:57,158 --> 01:19:00,920
stuff start you know especially in the

2251
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,679
last 40 years yeah you know I think it's

2252
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,560
pretty amazing how far the plan has come

2253
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:06,679
in the last 40 years well think about it

2254
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,480
think about the folks up in Humble that

2255
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:11,199
jumped on a plane yeah said you know

2256
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:13,439
we're on the same latitude as uh afgh

2257
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:14,799
Afghanistan yeah right so let's go spend

2258
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:17,119
some time over there let's go learn

2259
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:20,800
about that then they smuggle the those

2260
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:23,279
seeds back in mhm just from that action

2261
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,960
look how much change and inovation

2262
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:29,119
that's completely changed the game 100%

2263
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:30,920
you know and so that's where you know

2264
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:32,399
that's you know the those little pockets

2265
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,760
those little stories and those type of

2266
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:36,479
things is yes you have to respect the

2267
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,719
people that came before you but not only

2268
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,319
that learn from them you know it's just

2269
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,520
like people are going to learn from the

2270
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:44,000
things that we do right you know and all

2271
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,639
that so it's it's it's a it's a

2272
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,719
generational thing you know and that's

2273
01:19:45,639 --> 01:19:49,359
really if you can like I said if you can

2274
01:19:47,719 --> 01:19:51,359
touch one person and and they learn from

2275
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:53,000
you and they're like hey you know then

2276
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:54,238
then you did your job you did you did

2277
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,158
what you're supposed to you made your

2278
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:58,359
small little pocket that much better

2279
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:01,000
right you made your your that impact on

2280
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:03,479
the on the world but absolutely I think

2281
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,359
that you know especially a lot of people

2282
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:07,799
that should be vocal and should be out

2283
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:10,439
in the open were so traumatized by the

2284
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,360
bogus War on Drugs that they don't want

2285
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:14,000
to come out they're still afraid it's

2286
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:15,359
kind of like being in a bomb shelter for

2287
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,560
50 years because they thought Cuba was

2288
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:18,158
sending the missiles over and then they

2289
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,440
come out they've made movies about it

2290
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:20,920
you know what I mean right absolutely

2291
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:23,198
and Everything's changed and all that

2292
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:25,239
stuff but it's too like are great

2293
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:28,759
sources of of information but they're

2294
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:31,959
just been you know beat down right and

2295
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:33,440
and lied to and and propaganda that they

2296
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,600
they're afraid to they think that

2297
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:35,879
they're going to get arrested for even

2298
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,280
just talking about what they did in the

2299
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,239
past you know there's a lot of people

2300
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:41,679
I've met a lot of people like that so I

2301
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:44,079
got one last question for you if you

2302
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,319
were to look back at your younger self

2303
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:48,559
that had been in the industry for one or

2304
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:51,158
two years what is the one piece of

2305
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,000
advice you would give your younger self

2306
01:20:51,158 --> 01:20:55,879
I would just remind that just kind of

2307
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,520
the reminder of of the dark days lead to

2308
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:01,000
the better sunny days right uh it's a

2309
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:03,000
lot of work you know I mean it's it's

2310
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,079
hard to say because when you when you

2311
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,319
really break it down when you think

2312
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,119
about it it's like what would you tell

2313
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:08,679
your younger self and I've even had this

2314
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:10,319
conversation with a couple people is

2315
01:21:08,679 --> 01:21:11,880
like the way everything panned out and

2316
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:13,399
everything worked out yeah I don't even

2317
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,920
know if I even want to tamper with that

2318
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:17,679
by giving a little insight right because

2319
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,079
every little thing all those hard days

2320
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,800
all those good days all that stuff

2321
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:24,439
accumulated to make you you know the

2322
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,199
person you are right and and how and how

2323
01:21:24,439 --> 01:21:27,799
it shaped out you know it's just like

2324
01:21:26,198 --> 01:21:30,238
when you go to even farther back when

2325
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,279
you're a kid and yeah child you know

2326
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:33,839
terrible childhood the whole nine right

2327
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:34,960
chose not to make it an excuse right

2328
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,279
that I'm going to build off of it it's

2329
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,520
going to teach me it's going to teach me

2330
01:21:36,279 --> 01:21:40,559
not to get into harsh drug habit right

2331
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,600
because I know I se seen in my childhood

2332
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,039
what it does right you know and so when

2333
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,520
you get those type of questions like

2334
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:49,600
what kind of advice right I'd rather go

2335
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:51,400
back and and kind of watch and see you

2336
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,360
know right and and reminisce that way

2337
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:54,198
but I don't know if I'd really want to

2338
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:56,000
give my self- advice because I think it

2339
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:57,919
would change my trajectory and the

2340
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,600
things that I do and and it it would be

2341
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,880
a total different outcome those type of

2342
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:04,600
questions are are hard for me because I

2343
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:06,840
really pride myself on overcoming the

2344
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,920
adversities overcoming the stuff that

2345
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,039
you know overcoming the stuff that was

2346
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,319
supposed to take you out you know um I

2347
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:14,119
really value friendships I really value

2348
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,920
a ton of stuff that's why I have some of

2349
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:18,559
the same friends from uh when I you know

2350
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,158
when I went to school Sor to disappoint

2351
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,120
you on that question but no no that that

2352
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:24,559
was a great answer it's funny because we

2353
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:26,319
get this wide amount of you know the

2354
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,360
diversity in the answers is all across

2355
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:30,079
the board and I love that answer I think

2356
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:32,079
my younger self would literally tell me

2357
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:34,319
to [ __ ] off you know what I mean right

2358
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:35,679
ex the language but you know it' be like

2359
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:37,799
beat it beat it old man what are you

2360
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,319
talking about right I got this right

2361
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:43,360
that's the mentality you've always had

2362
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:44,679
like I got this right or or you know um

2363
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:46,920
like even with my partner we joke all

2364
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:49,600
the time because it's like for us to

2365
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,920
kind of inquire like oh extra help or

2366
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,760
something like that right it's just

2367
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:55,000
you're you're stubborn like oh going to

2368
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,920
do it myself right we you know we're on

2369
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,760
that same path but it's like anything

2370
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:00,639
right MH you just you're just going to

2371
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:02,520
do it you're no matter how hard it is

2372
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,960
right you know yeah so it it makes it

2373
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,320
makes it a pretty interesting

2374
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,239
interesting Dynamic but yeah that's uh

2375
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,559
that's one of the things where you when

2376
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:10,799
you when you look at those type of

2377
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,719
questions or those hypothetical

2378
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,320
questions you're like I don't know if

2379
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:15,239
I'd want to change anything you know

2380
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:16,840
yeah save more money you might not end

2381
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:19,319
up in the same position how about you

2382
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:21,560
what would you do so no one's ever asked

2383
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:23,198
me that but if I was to go back and you

2384
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,800
know I would say

2385
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,119
don't worry about the small stuff you

2386
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,520
know one foot in front of the other and

2387
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:29,800
everything's going to be okay I think

2388
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,920
that would be my big answer and you know

2389
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,079

going to be great days and you got to

2393
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:40,679
live in the moment it's not about the

2394
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:43,159
destination it's about the journey and

2395
