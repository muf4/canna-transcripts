from, this is my stomping grounds and

21
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,478
you know, this is where I started

22
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,158
growing weed as a young kid right here.

23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,400
So, it's exciting to be here. Thanks for

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
that. And on the Rosin Techch thing, I'm

just a partner with Sam in that, you

26
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,400
know, partner that Sam's grinding it.

27
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,319
I'm building these other businesses and

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,359
Yeah, that's my homie right there. Yeah,

29
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,199
for sure. Yeah. So, tell us about Soil

30
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,879
King cuz I hear Soil King, soil king,

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
soil king from all over. And there was

32
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,959
this confusion of Kings Mix and Soil

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,478
King and I'm like, wait, is it these

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,039
things? That's a good story. It's a

35
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,719
laughable story. Um, you know, Royal

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,560
Gold are all they're friends of mine. I

37
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,478
love I love the whole crew, you know,

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,320
the owner, my friend, all of them. And

39
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,118
so we used to go up to Sparetime Supply

40
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,199
and do a horseshoe tournament contest

41
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,359
and the Soil King team was just wiping

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,399
the floor every year. We finally, we

43
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,200
lost finally. But that was an inside

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,640
joke was the Soil King, you know, it was

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
like screw you. We're going to come out

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,878
with a the Kings mix, right? As a joke.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
Next thing you know, here it showed up.

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,159
So, out of resp, you know, if it was

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,680
anybody else, uh, you know, I'd be, you

50
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,439
know, who knows? There's plenty of room

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
in the game, but totally, but it felt

52
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,560
good having, you know, that was a good

53
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,239
move. It was definitely a good move.

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
And, and they're definitely a company

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,239
that I ride shoulder-to-shoulder with.

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,560
No doubt. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. I love those

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,159
guys, too. I think there's a good group

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,199
of uh community, especially Humbult,

59
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,519
Menaceino, you know, it's just the

60
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,039
Emerald Triangle and the ones that are

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,759
left, everybody just, you know, we all

62
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,479
smile at each other. Yeah, totally.

63
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,239
Yeah, it's uh it's and it's just not to

64
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,560
get off subject, but I I'm driving

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
through coming here. These are my

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,199
stomping grounds. This is where I I I

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,439
you know, this is where the 13-year-old

68
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,759
boy within right here was coined. And

69
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,959
you know, I was I was growing weed and

70
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,719
Niles Canyon, Wyel Winery, uh Mil Creek

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,560
Road by Aloney College at at 9, 10, 11

72
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,318
years old, right? I was arrested in

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,158
Fremont for the first time in handcuffs

74
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,518
for growing weed in a pine tree. And

75
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,120
this has been my stomping grounds. You

76
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,439
know, I was homeless as a kid. I'm built

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,599
by my stories. So, I'm I don't I'm not

78
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,639
ashamed of anything or, you know, I'm

79
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,719
I'm totally built by by all that in my

80
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,119
life. And so, coming back here and just

81
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,878
kind of reminiscing and seeing, you

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,319
know, where I started from was pretty

83
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,719
cool. And this little whole strip

84
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,878
downtown right here. Yeah. This was

85
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,598
awesome. Yeah, I love it here. And it's

86
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,158
like uh we're a step away from Oakland.

87
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,919
It's a little bit safer. Yeah. You know,

88
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,519
Oakland's a little crazy right now.

89
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,839
Yeah. So, so let's dive into your

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,599
history. Yeah. When did you start

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
smoking? Uh when did you fall in love

92
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,839
with the plant? I was living in in

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,000
Fremont, California. You know, I didn't

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
have a lot of discipline in my life. Uh

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,639
had really no discipline in my life. So,

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,639
I hung out with the older crew, right?

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,958
And there was a stoner crew back then.

98
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,559
And they loved me as a kid. And those

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,080
were my people that, you know, took me

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,000
under their wing. And so I my my first

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
memory is hands in the soil growing

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,919
strawberries. And so my I've been

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,438
cultivating everything since I was a

104
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,078
kid. I still do. That's why my biggest

105
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,199
thing is there's no segregation in

106
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,959
agriculture. I'll say it for the back of

107
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
the room back. There's no segregation in

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
agriculture. Man, cannabis is a

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
botanical just like anything else. And

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,199
you know, botanicals save lives. this

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,199
way they, you know, they segregate this

112
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
and make it a higher commodity and more

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,600
tax is just a bunch of [ __ ] But

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,319
getting back to my hands in the soil as

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,000
a kid, it was about 9 years old, 8 n

116
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,360
years old, I started smoking weed

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
because it was cool. I was hanging out

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,759
with an older

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,040
crowd and I remember one day I was

120
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,360
probably nine nine years old and they'd

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,600
have uh zigzags were around back then.

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm 56 years old, so this is in the 80s,

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,280
right? Yeah. Yeah. and 70s actually and

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,360
going into the 80s. Yeah, it was like 79

125
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,198
something like that. And they're they

126
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,879
Columbia weed was all everything was

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,560
seated back then no matter what. Nobody

128
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,839
complained about seeded weed back then

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,399
because there was no such thing as

130
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,079
nonseed weed back then. So they, you

131
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,159
know, we'd break it up brickweed or

132
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,198
whatever it is on an album cover like a

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Led Zeppelin album cover or, you know,

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,319
and uh this and then you you tilt the

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,918
album cover and you let the you take the

136
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,680
zigzag card and you hit it and all the

137
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,359
seeds would drop on the ground. And for

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
me, you know, I was a little

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
entrepreneur back then and I'm thinking

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
these fools are paying money for lids,

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,400
four-finger lid, remember back in the

142
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,319
day and and I'm like, I can grow [ __ ]

143
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,000
anything already. So that's where it all

144
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,519
coined, man. Next thing you know, I was

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
growing weed and I was selling it to

146
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,639
everybody and had my own four-finger

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,520
lids and you know that's where it coined

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,960
and I was 11 years old growing weed in a

149
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,279
pine tree

150
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:55,120
and the neighbor saw me. I figured if

151
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,719
anybody's going to see weed out, you

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
know, in a field, they're going to see

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,639
me walking out there. But as a kid back

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
then, there was no like Nintendo and

155
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
video games. We want we did forts, we

156
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,839
climbed trees, we did all that. That's

157
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,439
what we did every day, right? And so I

158
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,959
figured if I'm up on a platform so

159
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,560
people would just think it's a fort. I

160
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,758
kind of built it all set up like that.

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,680
And the neighbor I was watering I' I'd

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,199
take, you know, milk jugs and stuff and

163
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,560
pull them up and I was watering and the

164
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,478
water was going through hitting the

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
ground and making noise and a neighbor a

166
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,879
little ways away. He's looking at me.

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
He's looking at me and [ __ ] it was 45

168
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,360
minutes later, man. The cops were there

169
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,399
throwing handcuffs on me. Wow. Yeah. And

170
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,600
so that was when my first uh stint doing

171
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,879
time for this plant. Um the next time

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,319
was one year later, same tree, same

173
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,079
mistake. And that's where I learned the

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,919
outlaw [ __ ] from that point on. You

175
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,599
know, you don't you got to diversify.

176
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,359
You got to figure it out. Switch it up a

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
little. Yeah. Insanity is repeating the

178
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
same thing over and over expecting

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,879
different results. Totally. Yeah. So

180
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,680
that's kind of where where it started

181
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,038
for me, I would say. Well, and I think

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,360
there's something to be said for the

183
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,639
seeds that came out of the the weed back

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,160
then, like the Mexican, the Colombian,

185
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
wherever else we were getting it from,

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
you know, a capoco, you know, all these

187
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,279
different varieties. A lot of the

188
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,639
genetics were actually good. They just

189
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,719
weren't grown to the best of their

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,759
ability. And they grew them with very

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,520
little inputs and they they mashed them

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,160
all up and they pressed them and made

193
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,918
them look ugly. But I think the genetics

194
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,520
were there like you could pop the seeds

195
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,519
like you were doing and actually get

196
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,439
really good flour. Yeah, totally. I mean

197
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,318
there back then was Afghanistan white,

198
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,959
there was Hawaiian, there was uh

199
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,479
Columbia Gold, obviously Ala Alapuka

200
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:41,038
Gold, uh what else was there? Wakan. And

201
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,800
so I still have seeds. Maybe that's a

202
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,839
project we can work on together because

203
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,400
I can't bring him back. But I my uh my

204
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,918
brother Bill

205
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,198
Rogers, not blood brother, but he, you

206
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,799
know, we raised each other together. He

207
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,800
lives in Iowa now. Ma, his mother passed

208
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,478
away about 10 years ago. And and uh as I

209
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,478
went to the funeral, I came out and he

210
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,758
comes down from upstairs and he says,

211
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,918
"I've been keeping this for you this

212
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,840
whole time." And it was I remember Jack

213
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,439
Daniels used to have a tin where you

214
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,359
open it up and the Jack Daniel bottle

215
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,959
was in it. Totally. And so that tin was

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,439
like the most special thing ever. Right.

217
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,959
Those are stash boxes. And And he comes

218
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,959
down. He goes, "You can have this, but

219
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm keeping the tin." Right. And so I

220
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,279
open it up and there's all of my seeds.

221
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,199
Wow. From a kid. He had all of them. So

222
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,959
there's And there's all these notes.

223
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,079
I'll show I'll bring all these out. I'll

224
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,120
send you pictures of them. All these

225
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,439
notes. Super skunky. Right. Yeah. I even

226
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
have notes of like extra seed because I

227
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,279
didn't when I was cultivating back then,

228
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,519
I didn't know. There's nothing to read

229
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,200
about male and female plant. Uhhuh.

230
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,799
Right. There was nothing like that. So

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
really a female plant was always

232
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,439
pollinated with some seeds in it. Sure.

233
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,440
Yeah. And and so I remember growing up

234
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
Mil Creek Road on the side of a mountain

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,320
just crushing it and berries and oak

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
trees and and next thing you know I see

237
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,680
these plants and they're male plants. I

238
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
had never seen a male plant before. I'm

239
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,599
like this thing is no good. Like what is

240
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,560
going on here? And that's kind of the

241
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,080
evolution of of understanding the plant,

242
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,679
you know, at that point. It's pretty

243
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,200
interesting being a young kid trying to

244
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,359
figure that stuff out. Well, yeah. and

245
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,879
discovering all these new things, you

246
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,639
know, and it's when you have somebody

247
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,320
telling you about how to do stuff, it's

248
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,039
so much different than learning stuff on

249
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,278
your own. Yeah. As far as accessibility

250
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,039
to knowledge, it's amazing what's out

251
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,720
there. Yeah. You know, now we have the

252
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,000
internet. We have a lot of people were

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
were able to talk about it freely.

254
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
Before you couldn't talk about it, it

255
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
was like if you did, it was you could

256
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,639
get arrested for talking about it. Yeah.

257
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,599
Yeah. There was no access to knowledge

258
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,600
other than me saying, you know, I'm a,

259
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
you know, I I had a hard up upbringing.

260
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,519
I didn't really have much and I was

261
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,000
homeless as a as a kid as well, too,

262
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,159
living on my own. Yeah. But, uh, I had

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,679
to hustle. I'm a born [ __ ] hustler

264
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,838
when it comes to that. And so, when I

265
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,599
saw the opportunity, I seized the

266
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,600
moment. And, you know, I've made money

267
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
my whole life off cannabis. The only

268
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
time I really didn't is when I got out

269
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,080
of San Quinton and I, you know,

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,440
everybody told me that cannabis was a

271
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,080
gateway drug back into, you know, I'm a

272
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,000
recovered addict and and that would

273
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,560
happen. So, I raised my kids and I, you

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,200
know, for a decade I didn't do [ __ ] and

275
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,679
a little over a decade I quit because I

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
was afraid of of really [ __ ] up my

277
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,120
life or [ __ ] up the kids' life that I

278
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
brought into this world. And what I come

279
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,360
to find out, I'm green and sober today,

280
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,679
super proud. And the plant is my

281
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,600
medicinal side of recovery. I'm not not

282
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,599
pharmacy, not the pharmaceuticals they

283
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,519
throw down your throat. For me, I'm

284
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,079
green and sober and proud of it. Yeah,

285
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,839
me too. Me too. And in fact, I cut out

286
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,439
alcohol the last month and I feel a lot

287
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
better. That's awesome, brother. Yeah. I

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
mean, it's it's not easy to do. You

289
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
know, I got some guys that we follow

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
along on the the podcast. I follow their

291
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,439
podcast that have been clean over for

292
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,800
years and it's it's it's impressive. Uh,

293
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
you know, and it's a social thing. So,

294
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,479
it's not easy to break that trend. But

295
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,759
when you're not going out and hanging

296
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
out with everybody all the time, it's

297
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,278
also a lot easier. It's totally easier,

298
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,039
man. I mean, I mean, you go in a barber

299
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,480
shop, you get a [ __ ] haircut. You go

300
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,159
hang out with the boys in the bar,

301
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
you're getting drunk, right? You hate

302
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,159
you, you know, you wouldn't have this.

303
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,240
If you weren't the type of individual

304
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,879
you were building stuff like this,

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,959
right? You you hang around those type of

306
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,480
people that can lift you up in life.

307
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,278
Yeah. What is there the saying that if

308
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,800
you hang out with uh five smart people,

309
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,399
you're probably the six? And if you hang

310
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,319
out with five stupid people, you're

311
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,958
probably the six. I think that goes on

312
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,278
and on and on. Yeah, for sure. You know,

313
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,399
it's uh you're you're the average of

314
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,600
there's the other one that's you're the

315
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,639
average of uh your your friends. So,

316
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,959
makes a lot of sense. Yeah. In business

317
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,199
for me, you know, I have my my mentor

318
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,119
Dr. Gray Reed who's a million he's

319
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040

329
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,480

I put at the table has to be smarter

333
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,159
than me in a category. Yeah. Right.

334
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,560
Because I can't I can't do it all and I

335
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,519
can't even lie to myself and say I can.

336
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,119
Like I'm good at my [ __ ] and that's it.

337
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,600
You know, you're speaking my words. I

338
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,278
feel the exact same way. Um I'm I'm good

339
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
at what I'm good at, but I work with the

340
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,399
people that are the best at what they're

341
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,879
good at. And together we have the best

342
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
team. Right. Exactly. And that's how you

343
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,399
build businesses. That's how you build

344
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
things that last. That's how you build

345
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,360
things that are successful. For sure. I

346
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,040
think Sam and I, we uh, you know, we

347
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,000
experienced a lot of a lot of this. When

348
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,838
I met first met Sam, my partner from Ros

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,839
and T. He's been on the show. Oh, yeah.

350
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,680
That's right. He has been here. He said

351
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,440
I'd be impressed when I came in here.

352
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,519
Yeah. He didn't he didn't let me down on

353
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,360
that. That's for sure. Yeah. You know,

354
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,759
just talking about the the structure and

355
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
the hardcore business. You know, you

356
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,078
know, Sam's hated me at times. I've

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
hated Sam at times. And I love Sam and

358
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,679
he loves me. And that's just the

359
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:13,039
relationship at the end of the day. This

360
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:17,919
industry destroys relationships period,

361
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:21,360
right? So nobody had the right assets or

362
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,799
or you know road mapap for success

363
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,480
because it never happened and there was

364
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,000
no successful road map to be had. Right.

365
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,079
Right. At the end of the day, you put it

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,159
all in, you live for passion and you you

367
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,919
cross your fingers. And we just happen

368
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,679
to be a couple dudes that are still

369
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,039
standing, you know. Yeah. You got to

370
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,159
understand how to pivot. I think that's

371
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,078
the other thing that like when

372
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,719
something's not working there there's

373
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,559
ways to pivot. Uh and also double down

374
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,160
on what you're good at. Like if you're

375
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,078
good at something, keep doubling down on

376
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,919
that, you know. And I think, you know,

377
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,519
and Sam's Sam's good at business. We do

378
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,919
the dabadoo together. We we did the

379
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,879
event with for Mila and Yeah. I mean,

380
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,599
Sam, we we ran it really well, you know,

381
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,278
for such short notice. Sam came and

382
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,959
saved me for the event to be honest.

383
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,159
Yeah. Awesome. And uh yeah, and we're

384
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,198
looking forward to doing another one

385
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,799
this year. And uh yeah, I just it's

386
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,719
great working with people like Sam who

387
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,078
who are very organized, but also as a

388
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
team player in the sense that he knows

389
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,838
how to manage, but he has guys his

390
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
right-hand man is amazing, you know?

391
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,160
It's like these guys crush it. Paul is

392
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,120
great. Yeah. No, we learned that those

393
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,958
are those are those are hog hard knock,

394
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,639
you know, things situations that you

395
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,719
learn. Again, we started this

396
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,198
conversation at bettering the table with

397
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,160
better individuals, you know, and in

398
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,519
areas that you fall short on. and Sam

399
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,879
and me, you know, we went through

400
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,320
complete hell. And at the end of the

401
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,919
day, we looked at each other and said,

402
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,839
"We can do this together. We don't need

403
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,838
money. Everybody Everybody's at our

404
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,279
throats. Everybody's trying to sue us.

405
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,480
You know, we can fight this. We can do

406
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,159
all this stuff." And we said, "Let's

407
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,039
[ __ ] go, man." Me and him shoulder

408
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,639
and shoulder. And from that point on, we

409
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,439
realized no matter what, we're a solid

410
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,600
team in this industry. And there's a lot

411
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,639
of things coming out. And when I turn

412
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,000
around and I'm scared or not feeling it

413
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,959
or don't know how to get through

414
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,639
something, I can call Sam. Sam with me

415
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,559
and say, "Look, man. This is this is

416
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,159
some, you know, unt untouched waters

417
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,759
right now. You know, this is what I'm

418
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,679
feeling." And Sam's like, "Man, you got

419
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,799
this." Yeah. And we got this. Look at

420
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,319
what we've been through. Look where

421
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,639
we're going. And same thing with me and

422
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
him. You know, I call him. I'm like,

423
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,519
"Bro, you know, I'm proud of you." Yeah.

424
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,120
I'm straight proud of you. Like, you

425
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,519
made it through that [ __ ] that last

426
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,480
jungle with the with a lawsuit on the

427
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,440
Puff Co situation, man. I'm like, balls

428
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,759
deep. My brother Sam, he uh he saw it,

429
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
he went for it, he never gave up, you

430
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,919
know. I would say he out he outplayed

431
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,440
the he outplayed the table, too. You

432
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,679
know, he totally outplayed it and uh he

433
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,480
deserved it, you know. Yeah. It's

434
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,399
interesting with business

435
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,399
and there not being any sort of playbook

436
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,360
and kind of making it up as you go

437
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,958
along. And I think, you know, it's it's

438
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,399
one of those things that like you you

439
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,679
have to believe in yourself so much even

440
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,039
when other people don't believe in it.

441
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,479
As long as you believe in it, that's

442
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,759
what really counts. U it's an amazing

443
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,680
thing. And we're in an amazing time in

444
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
the industry because we have had a lot

445
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,439
of friends fail and we have had a lot of

446
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,599
friends suffer and you know before it

447
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,600
was people were going to prison for the

448
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
plant the government was. that now

449
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,800
they're being, you know, taken out of

450
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,199
the industry because they can't afford

451
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,078
to be in the industry because there's no

452
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:21,679
profit, you know, especially on the

453
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,838
cultivation side. It's really sad some

454
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,439
of the best cultivators out there are

455
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,199
struggling because I would love to see

456
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,040
them be successful. That's why I'm not a

457
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,359
cultivator. I love growing and I think

458
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,879
it's amazing, but I also see that I can

459
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,039
work with cultivators. I can work with

460
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,958
the best cultivators out there and I can

461
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,719
really focus on genetics. That's for me

462
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,559
too. Yeah. Yeah. Living soil and

463
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
producing the best rosins and

464
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,159
solventless and Yeah. in the picks and

465
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,079
shovel side of this and I still own the

466
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,399
cannabis side of it too. I mean, I'm I'm

467
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,638
really

468
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,399
diversified in this industry and and uh

469
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,639
like you said, man, I think I think in

470
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,159
Menescino County back before Prop 64,

471
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
there's over 11,000 farmers in

472
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,480
application to become licensed, right?

473
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,799
We got duped. We got we got totally

474
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,640
taken advantage of. You know, what are

475
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,879
we at now? Dozen. Yeah. Like, come on,

476
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
man. Like, we lost And that's just

477
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
licensed. That's not unlicensed, right?

478
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,439
The whole Emerald Triangle was built off

479
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,918
unlicensed. So, right, you look at the

480
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,679
generational farmers and the family of

481
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,000
people that I grabbed the belt loop that

482
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,679
taught me, you know, everything are no

483
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,359
longer around anymore. Right. And we're

484
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,640
talking about very devotional farmers

485
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,798
that believed in the plant, that

486
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,280
believed in what they did and also grew

487
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,798
really good flour. Exactly. You know,

488
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,399
and that's the sad part is when they

489
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,160
knew everything. Yeah. We grew

490
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,798
everything for Do you remember going up

491
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,798
north and you know like like area 101

492
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,440
where we have these everything was a

493
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,200
barter trade? Yeah, right. I there's

494
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,360
people sell trading leather, there's

495
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,440
people that got raw milk, there's eggs,

496
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,759
there's veggies, there's cannabis,

497
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,320
there's, you know, pottery, there's

498
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,319
edibles, there's just and everybody's in

499
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,918
every it's all bartered trade. It's like

500
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,759
what do you got? Oh, you got that. I

501
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,080
want that. Well, I got this. Next thing

502
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,000
you know, we're walking out of there,

503
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,279
right? That's how it was. So you got

504
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,359
that's how it should be. And that's how

505
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,440
it should be. So these farmers in the

506
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,959
mountains, they they did everything.

507
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,880
Yeah. You know, they didn't just grow

508
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,319
cannabis. They they cultured their

509
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,919
entire life. They didn't have to leave

510
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,599
the mountain because they were, you

511
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,520
know,

512
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:21,439
sustainability was the key. For sure.

513
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,599
And they built a quality community

514
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,558
around what they did. Yeah. You know, I

515
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,038
think uh it was inclusive and exclusive

516
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,599
at the same time. Yeah. Totally. You had

517
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,038
to watch your back for sure. Definitely.

518
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,719
Yeah. You had to watch. She was coming

519
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,919
in. Yeah. Someone had to be the

520
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,839
gatekeeper. Yes. So, you said a a great

521
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,120
quote that I stole and I didn't hear it

522
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,720
directly from you. I heard it from a guy

523
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,639
named OG Steve who's one of my good

524
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,919
friends. Yeah. But when he was going to

525
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,880
your uh farm to pick up some soil Yeah.

526
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,038
years ago, he said, "Pat, I need to get

527
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,480
a big discount on this stuff." Yeah. And

528
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:59,119
he said, "Steve, I really like you, but

529
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I like me more." And that is maybe one

530
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,879
of the best quotes ever. And I've

531
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,679
actually used that. And and I think it's

532
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
it's funny, but you know, it's like it's

533
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,120
a great quote. It's a great quote. It

534
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,959
really is because we have to survive,

535
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,798
you know. So when my numbers of soil, I

536
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,480
my inputs are so expensive because I

537
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,279
source everything at the highest level.

538
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,798
So when it comes to that, I don't have a

539
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,639
whole lot of margins. You don't see me

540
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,160
living [ __ ] you know, I'm like I'm

541
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,919
trying to take care. I'm a farmer taking

542
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
care of farmers at the end of the day.

543
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,600
Well, and you pride yourself in quality.

544
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,439
Totally. With quality. Quality and

545
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,959
consistency. Consistency is super

546
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
important, too. That's just as important

547
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,720
as quality because what does it matter?

548
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
You know, if if you have one good batch

549
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,440
and one bad batch, same thing with

550
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,319
flour, same thing with everything in the

551
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,240
industry, whether it's seeds, soil, any

552
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,480
sort of inputs, it's all about

553
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,798
consistency. It is. And like if I get a

554
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,200
if I get truckload of castings in, if I

555
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,079
get whatever it is that's coming in, I I

556
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,679
I test everything before I make a mix

557
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,759
design. You know how you understand

558
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,480
testing? You know how costly I spend

559
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,798
just in labs? Incredible. cost a lot of

560
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,120
money, you know, and more and more every

561
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,519
year. So, the dollar's worth less. All

562
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,599
this stuff costs us more. And you know

563
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,319
who suffers is, you know, the the

564
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,399
industry as a whole, unfortunately. If

565
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,240
you ain't got passion, you know, you

566
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,320
ain't got purpose. There's just not a

567
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,558
seat at this table left anymore for you,

568
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,639
right? Because if you're here for money,

569
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,000
you know, you I teach branding and

570
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,400
marketing all the time, and the biggest

571
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,679
thing I teach is you brand yourself and

572
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,519
you build yourself now. Yeah. And you

573
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,120
everybody's worried about getting paid

574
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,400
to build the brand. How am I going to

575
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:36,479
make money? Soil King was built a decade

576
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,320
before I made any money. Yeah. Right.

577
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Money didn't start rolling in. I put

578
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,639
million dollars into the brand in order

579
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,038
to be where I'm at today. And that's

580
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,520
just that's just facts, you know? So,

581
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,279
and and the other part of marketing and

582
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,558
branding I really like to hammer home

583
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,319
and educate is brand yourself. Yeah.

584
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,918
Right. The problem out here is we have

585
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,240
all these like corporate companies and

586
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,000
different companies, you know, and they

587
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,240
have all these influencers that work for

588
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,759
them and they're just marketing the

589
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,200
brand they work for and then they

590
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,640
realize they don't have a job and the

591
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,400
brand never gave a [ __ ] about them in

592
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
the first place, right? So even if

593
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,759
you're going to brand your corporate,

594
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,918
get a brand for yourself and collab,

595
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,079
man. Build yourself on that so when that

596
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,120
one falls off, you're still elevated.

597
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,158
Yeah. Totally. Yeah. Branding is so huge

598
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,599
and I think a lot of people

599
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,360
see people that they look up to in the

600
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,719
industry and and all they see is the tip

601
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,479
of the iceberg. They don't see the

602
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,159
struggles that you went through going to

603
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,679
prison typically, you know, then they

604
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,280
see the soil king as somebody they see

605
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,280
James Loud as this guy who's doing this

606
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,558
podcast and all this other stuff. But I

607
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,879
mean, I've been doing this since 91.

608
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,678
I've been smoking weed since 91, growing

609
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,360
since the mid 90s. And I'm here because

610
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,960
of all the steps that got me here. It's

611
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,439
it's so many things and working on the

612
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,120
shoulders of giants, you know. Rest in

613
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,279
peace Sam Skunkman passed away recently.

614
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,678
You know, guys like Sam who really had

615
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,079
impact on on all the breeders out there

616
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,759
whether you know it or not. Sam had big

617
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:04,000
influence and big impact on the genetics

618
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,279
and uh you know it's like we're all

619
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
working on the shoulders of so many

620
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,038
giants that came before us, the guys

621
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,640
that went to prison. You know it's it's

622
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,038
legal to a degree right now. It's not

623
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
federally legal yet, but cannabis has

624
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,960
been going in the direction of legality

625
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,159
because there were outlaws, right? Yeah.

626
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,679
I'm not saying criminals. We're saying

627
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,440
outlaws, right? And I think they're two

628
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,200
different things. And we're outlaws to

629
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,720
pioneers. Yeah. You know, that's what I

630
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,960
coined that, too. And I just love it

631
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,480
because I'm a pioneer. You're you're

632
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,558
you're talking about being in the

633
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,519
industry since beginning of the '9s,

634
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,119
right? You're pioneered, right? You

635
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,119
pioneered this to where it's at today,

636
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,319
even though you grabbed the belt loop of

637
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,839
somebody else that brought you in it.

638
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,839
And this is how this thing works. The

639
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,000
baton has been passed to me. It's been

640
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,000
passed to you. And now we're coming up

641
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,519
to this new generation where we used to

642
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,359
go to, you know, there was you can go to

643
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,798
10 years in federal prison for a couple

644
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,479
seeds. Like that's where it was at

645
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,759
literally. I have friends that went to

646
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,759
jail for seeds. Went to or for clones

647
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,359
and went to prison for seeds. Yeah. You

648
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,119
know, and it's like in Texas going to

649
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,719
prison for seeds, you know, and there

650
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,119
there's seeds, right? And this is Yeah.

651
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,200
It's real. And now they're federally

652
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,959
legal, considered hemp by the farm bill.

653
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,679
So you can ship seeds to any state

654
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,919
anywhere. They can they can be used for

655
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,480
food, they can be used for whatever, but

656
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,000
uh they're federally legal. So different

657
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,440
world. I was in I was at organic

658
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,400
conference speaking a speaking

659
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,480
engagement in outside of Boston and I

660
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,798
was sitting at a table. I don't need to

661
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,759
say names, but uh he was in agriculture

662
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,279
and and you know this one guy who's you

663
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,119
know I don't really rub the right way.

664
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,000
Whatever it's good he's you know I'm not

665
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,079
knocking anything but he's he's

666
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,720
complaining about how he's saying how

667
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:46,519
these [ __ ] cannabis people can charge

668
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,759
$10 a seed is out of my [ __ ] mind. I

669
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,839
got, you know, bags and buckets and

670
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,640
seeds. And he's talking about, you know,

671
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,839
tomato seeds, watermelon seeds, and he's

672
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,400
bitching and complaining. I said,

673
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:01,199
"Motherfucker, you don't go to prison."

674
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,280
Yeah. For a watermelon seed. Yeah. That

675
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,558
10 bucks can give you 10 [ __ ]

676
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,879
years. Like, if you don't think that

677
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,480
that seed is worth 10 bucks where these

678
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,760
breeders have really come from, you're

679
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,319
crazy, man. They gave everything for

680
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,919
this culture and moment. 10 bucks, 10

681
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,240
years. Like, come on. That's the reality

682
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,880
and that's why it's elevated now.

683
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,558
There's seeds everywhere, right? And but

684
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
it's, you know, that's that's our

685
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,000
culture and where it comes from. And we

686
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,798
have to remind people that, yeah, man,

687
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,038
10 bucks ain't [ __ ] 10 years over 10

688
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,278
bucks. Yeah. And I mean, clones $5,000,

689
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,000
but what can it make you, right? Is that

690
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,558
if if you're spending $10 on a seed, it

691
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,159
has the potential. It's still a lottery,

692
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,480
right? with seeds. It's a lottery, but

693
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,640
$10 a seed is not even that much money

694
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,159
if you think of what happens if you get

695
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,320
lucky and you find that next winner,

696
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,000
right? I remember the purple tangi pack.

697
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,278
Oh, yeah. He was there during all that.

698
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,798
Great. Steve found it. I mean, that

699
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,679
changed his life. He has he is the

700
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,679
purple tangy man, right? And he just he

701
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,759
found the seed, right? So, like along

702
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,440
with a couple other guys, but yeah. And

703
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,440
then they cultivated it and saved it.

704
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,278
Like that's even the next level of oh my

705
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,038
god, how did that happen? Like he just

706
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,599
didn't grow it out. Good old OG Steve

707
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,079
Hakati there. He got like four three or

708
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,079
four packs of tangi seeds. Yeah. And one

709
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,158
came out as the purple tangi. Just one

710
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,839
randomly came out. Now now DNA has since

711
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,159
found other ones. They have their blood

712
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,839
orange and Crockett and DNA have their

713
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,360
blood orange. But yeah, that purple

714
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,439
tangi was something special back then,

715
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,038
too. Yeah. And tells you the oneoff. So,

716
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,720
you know, we always talk about F1s are

717
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,278
going all the way down to stabiliz, you

718
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,558
know, stabilizing the genetics. But, you

719
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:41,119
know, I always say, you know, and I get

720
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,599
a lot of flack on this, but for for me,

721
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:47,038
it's super important that breeders, it's

722
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:49,918
it's like I don't walk onto a

723
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,319
construction site, never wearing a tool

724
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,038
bag or being an electrician, and call

725
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,278
myself a journeyman electrician. Yeah.

726
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,558
Right. So, this this entitlement of a

727
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,000
lot of our uh industry now is, you know,

728
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,278
you started messing with some pollen,

729
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,880
throwing on a plant, now you're a

730
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,798
breeder. They're actually taking that

731
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,679
name away from people who gave their

732
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,960
life, went to prison, who put who built

733
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,519
this whole industry, right? I I prefer

734
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,519
the term seed producer. Like you you're

735
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,200
producing seeds. That's truth. You're

736
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,558
breeding. Are you breeding to stabilize

737
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,480
stuff or you just making seeds? And

738
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,480
there's nothing wrong with nothing wrong

739
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,120
at all, you know, but I think breeder is

740
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,519
used very frequently. And you know, who

741
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,199
am I to judge on on some level? But at

742
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,558
the same time, I feel like a good term

743
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,159
if you want to call yourself somebody

744
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,599
who's making seeds, unless you're

745
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,120
actually doing the work. Cuz the

746
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,719
breeding actually isn't making the

747
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,558
seeds. That's the seed production.

748
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,079
Breeding is actually doing selections.

749
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,558
Picking those selections and crossing

750
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,759
them back is is how I look at it. A lot

751
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,359
of guys are like big in calling

752
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,960
themselves breeders and all they do is

753
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,879
take this plus this and they make this

754
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,200
and they're the next big breeder. And

755
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,440
that's okay. What I don't I try not to

756
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,038
judge. I try not to get over I'm getting

757
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,798
older right now so I don't get upset

758
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,640
over [ __ ] that doesn't you know really

759
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,879
directly I'm not knocking that either

760
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,799
you know the purple tangy was a oneoff

761
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,440
right so I mean we need we need the

762
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,119
people that are you know placing pollen

763
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
we'll call it you know and doing

764
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,879
different things and it's cool to do

765
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,640
that but there's a there's a separation

766
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,200
of guys that you know I don't call

767
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,640
myself a breeder and I and I have M80

768
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,880
M1000 mama's cheese 20 you one mama's

769
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,120
mama's boy like I've won and I don't

770
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,520
call myself and I used to pop 1100 seeds

771
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,678
of one variety at a time. I end up with,

772
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,599
you know, four maybe six females and two

773
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,278
good structures of a male. And then I'd

774
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,519
start trying to learn how to stabilize

775
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,839
it. I don't call myself a breeder.

776
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,158
Right. Well, and I think in the Emerald

777
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,839
Triangle especially, you know, in other

778
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,278
places too, but in the Emerald Triangle

779
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:48,158
in the 70s, 80s, early 90s, maybe even

780
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,558
going into the 2000s, a lot of people

781
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,400
got their next crop from the seeds they

782
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,839
made that year. And so they were really

783
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,519
breeding, right? Yeah, they didn't call

784
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,439
themselves breeders a lot, but they did

785
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,960
make

786
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,200
seeds. We did. Yeah, we all did that.

787
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,600
Yeah, that is what got us to where we

788
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
are today, right? A lot of that work

789
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,959
we've piggybacked and you know, we have

790
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,480
all these new modern-day cultivars, but

791
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,880
a lot of the work was done previously

792
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,880
and now we're just seeing the

793
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,960
expressions today of all this stuff. And

794
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,799
very minimal work has gone in to get it

795
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,798
to the point where it's at now compared

796
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,639
to 10, 15, 20 years ago. Uh, and the

797
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,639
cannabis was really good back then. And

798
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,399
I think people don't understand when you

799
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,278
tell them it was good, even the stuff in

800
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,038
the early '9s, like we saw amazing stuff

801
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,200
and amazing outdoor. And there was more

802
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,038
amazing outdoor then than there is now

803
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
on average. So many more people are

804
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,679
growing indoors. But uh and I like good

805
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,839
outdoor. I like a really good outdoor. I

806
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,159
still I I love it. I like good indoor,

807
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,079
too, don't get me wrong. But yeah, that

808
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,679
really sticky where you take a bud and

809
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,439
you stick it to the side of a glass

810
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,159
piece of glass, you know, whatever side

811
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,919
of the bong. Yeah. That's special. I

812
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,159
mean, there's something to be said, man.

813
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,000
I like my I like my oranges kissed by

814
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,919
the sun. I like my cannabis kissed by

815
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,480
the sun. Even Even my depths were

816
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,880
retractable clear and black, right?

817
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Because I I wanted that during the day

818
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,679
kissed by the sun, right? Because

819
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,759
plastic, clear plastic's a UV blocker,

820
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,360
right? So that ultraviolet rays doesn't

821
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,119
ever touch it with a UV. And the reason

822
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,119
why they add that otherwise that plastic

823
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,199
would, you know, shred up in a year.

824
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,599
Yeah. Last five or six years. Well, it

825
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,519
changes the spectrum for sure. I mean,

826
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,439
it's just like cocoa versus soil. You

827
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,639
get different you get a different

828
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,240
effect, different flavor profile,

829
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,120
uh, you know, and it's funny cuz they're

830
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,319
doing all these studies on uh, flavors

831
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,678
and flavorants and flavonoids. Yeah.

832
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,359
And, you know, I was just reading how

833
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,200
flavonoids actually change the color.

834
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,158
It's not related to the flavor in that

835
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,919
sense, but uh, but yeah, the the color

836
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
of the plant has to more to do with the

837
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,240
flavonoids than flavor. I'm excited. I'm

838
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:54,798
I do a KC Canifest on 420, 418 and 19 in

839
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,798
Kansas City, Missouri. I'm hosting an MC

840
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,398
in that. I got soil king legends legacy

841
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,798
panel. I'm taking Swami and Nikki out

842
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,639
there. Awesome. And Swami's pan one of

843
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,960
his panels of flavonoids, right? And so

844
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,360
I'm he's really educated me on some

845
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
things in the last I'd say year, year

846
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,398
and a half on that. It's just so awesome

847
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,319
to watch our culture be educated and

848
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,239
understand and taking next leaps, you

849
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,000
know, and levels because it just keeps

850
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,759
as soon as we think, well, we were

851
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,440
talking tarpen, tarpen, turppines, and

852
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,798
then abstract tech comes out with these

853
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,960
white papers that are like, well, hey,

854
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,879
let's look at flavorants that a lot of

855
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,440
the sulfur based compounds that have to

856
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,399
do with smell. Okay, now now we're in a

857
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,399
different conversation. We were talking

858
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,599
about ths before a little bit, but

859
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,719
they're really hard to measure. And now

860
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,798
all of a sudden we're able to measure

861
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,880
these things. And that's crazy, you

862
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,319
know, and it's amazing, right? When we

863
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,480
think we have it all figured out, like

864
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,678
with HPS lights, all of a sudden LED

865
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
lights come out and they suck in the

866
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,240
beginning, but then they're better,

867
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,399
right? And now they're the industry

868
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,919
standard. Yeah. Totally. So yeah, we we

869
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,519
live in an amazing time. I mean, we're

870
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,799
just still scratching the surface of so

871
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,798
many things that are going to be

872
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,558
stabilized in the next 10 years. Yeah.

873
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,639
And on the on the living soil and the

874
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:02,158
soil and manipulating me minerals,

875
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,559
right? And so I do I do a uh this is

876
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,120
really fascinating [ __ ] I do a micro

877
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,759
green mix and I work with a couple micro

878
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,519
greenery green producers that produce

879
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,720
you know organic to grocery stores but

880
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,278
out in Texas um I I work with one out

881
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,000
there zero point organics and we're

882
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,720
manipulating with minerals on flavors to

883
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,558
fivestar restaurants. It's insane the

884
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,360
pro the process. you really don't

885
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,119
realize that you can take, you know, uh,

886
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,558
so something that's only alive for so

887
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,319
long and you can change the flavor with

888
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,879
minerals because for you guys that don't

889
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,558
understand, like with micro greens, um,

890
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,760
if you're doing microgreens or sprouts,

891
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,678
basically what you're doing is you're

892
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,480
putting them in a flat, uh, like the

893
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,320
ones you guys root your clones in and

894
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,839
you're basically taking a whatever

895
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,839
substrate you use and you're putting the

896
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,158
seeds in there. You water them 7 to 10

897
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,439
to 14 days later, you're cutting

898
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,039
sometimes a little bit longer for

899
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,798
certain things, but and sometimes a

900
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,759
little shorter for others. But you can

901
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:00,319
manipulate the flavor sounds like to a

902
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,158
lot, a big degree. Yeah. And we have

903
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,678
fivestar chefs coming in and they're

904
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,278
saying, "Hey, can you turn this up a

905
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,600
little bit? Can the you know, can you

906
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,679
can you get this uh radish a little

907
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,038
hotter at the end and not so hot in the

908
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,600
front?" And you these are things you

909
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,960
don't really are just like next level

910
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,798
stuff to me in the last couple years

911
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,519
that are super exciting that play a part

912
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,519
in all cultivation. Yeah. Right. It

913
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,278
plays a part in all cultivation. So at

914
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,000
the end, can you manipulate the flavor

915
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,599
of of a tarpin profile? Can you really?

916
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,278
Yes. The answer is yes. We're just

917
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,199
getting to that point like that. Yeah. I

918
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,278
mean, they have special broccoli for

919
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
people that have cancer, the broccoli

920
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,880
sprouts, right? And so there's a special

921
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,278
seed that they've they've discovered

922
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,960
that actually has higher concentrations.

923
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,200
I can't remember the chemical compound.

924
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,399
We'll show it on the screen, but uh but

925
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,919
yeah, it's really impressive. I think

926
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,518
everybody that grows cannabis should be

927
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,200
growing sprouts, too, because I think

928
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,798
any sort of sprouts, they're sprouts,

929
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,640
micro greens, they're super healthy.

930
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,158
They're super good for you. They taste

931
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,759
amazing. You can put them on pretty much

932
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,278
everything. I got them in my truck right

933
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:01,119
now. So, I got yellow or uh yeah, yellow

934
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,679
pea sprouts, right? I eat those all the

935
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,879
time. But the other part was fascinating

936
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,600
learning is the the nutrients the dense

937
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,919
of the density of nutrients in a micro

938
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:15,519
green let's say a broccoli versus you

939
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,200
eating a seed sprout versus a head

940
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,120
you're getting the same benefits from

941
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,798
that seed sprout as you are the entire

942
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,798
head of the broccoli. Totally. And

943
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,319
another thing I just learned is it isn't

944
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,480
the nutrients that grows in the

945
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,319
broccoli. It's the store nutrients

946
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,399
that's in the seed to get it to life and

947
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,759
to get it out and doing that. There's a

948
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,759
whole, you know, it's so And that's why

949
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,000
it's so concentrated. That's why it's so

950
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,599
concentrated. Yeah. And that's why you

951
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
got to take care of your seeds. All

952
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,879
seeds, right? They're like, when you're

953
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,798
growing them, you popping them. That's

954
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,399
why it's so important to grow organic.

955
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,200
Yeah. You know what I mean? I think that

956
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:50,158
growing organic with organic inputs uh

957
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,840
for seed production. Um, you know, and

958
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,039
there's there's arguments to be said for

959
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:54,558
all of it. You know, some people think

960
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,319
seed production should be done outside.

961
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,398
I prefer doing it inside so I can

962
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,558
control all the variables. Yeah. uh

963
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,239
prevent crosscontamination from other

964
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,599
pollen. I mean, you're at that level

965
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,440
right now just walking through here.

966
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,678
It's like it's crazy with production

967
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,358
with seeds. With me, it was I wanted I

968
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,280
cracked everything outside under green

969
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,918
houses, right? I had a 32 foot wide by

970
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,000
120T greenhouse with high ceilings and I

971
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,440
grew everything out and phenol hunted,

972
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,599
jacked them off. That's how I pheno

973
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,119
hunted and got everything down and I was

974
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,960
just clipping them out and at the end I

975
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,559
had, you know, 200 teenagers that I've

976
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,918
sourced all the way down to adding and

977
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,078
they're full they're full growing in

978
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,759
plants getting ready to start flipping.

979
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,039
So you were just taking the best dusting

980
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,520
a little pollen on the ones that you

981
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,519
thought would be the best and then out

982
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,358
of that then I would take those I'd find

983
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,119
the structure of the males that I wanted

984
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,039
and then I'd take the females that I

985
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,879
really liked and the expression outdoors

986
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,119
is totally different than indoors of a

987
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,759
plant. early morning versus midday

988
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,559
versus evening. So all those play a part

989
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,320
in in in sourcing and you know the best

990
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,759
cultivars that you wanted. So I that's

991
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,440
what I would do and then I'd go into the

992
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,000
breeding project after that. Now I had

993
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,440
the structure, now I had the females and

994
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
then I'd start doing my flavors and

995
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,920
that's kind of all where you know M80

996
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,880
and my M1000s and things or or trying to

997
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,480
pull I remember pulling Tai out of

998
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,559
AK-47. That was a cool project, right?

999
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,559
really getting that. And before that was

1000
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,239
even before, you know, I wish I still

1001
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,639
had that because I bet that would be

1002
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,078
really good ice water hash producer.

1003
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,838
Really, really, really good. Yeah. Shout

1004
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,320
out to Simon from Serious Seeds for

1005
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,639
doing the work on the AK-47.

1006
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,440
Yeah, I'm a big fan of Simon as well. He

1007
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,358
he's done amazing work and really went

1008
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,559
back to how breathing should be done

1009
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,719
with isolating stuff, creating F1s.

1010
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,159
Yeah. Um and hybridizing those and

1011
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,000
creating all his varieties, you know?

1012
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,199
It's like that that guy bred stuff.

1013
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,039
That's a breeder. That's what I'm

1014
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:46,879
saying. When when a guy calls himself a

1015
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,358
breeder, even me, because I've done it,

1016
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,119
but I'm not that level. I'm still I

1017
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:54,639
would say what do you call a journeyman

1018
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,200
plumber? I'm what is on my way up there,

1019
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,679
you know, whatever novice or am whatever

1020
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:04,078
it is. But you know, but you look at him

1021
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:06,399
and guys, guys like for sure, those guys

1022
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,440
deserve that title. So whatever that is,

1023
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,519
that plaque goes with work. It goes with

1024
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,440
dedication. Simon made five different

1025
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,119
things in five years originally. You

1026
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,679
know, it's like with the Cali miss, the

1027
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,200
AK-47.

1028
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,159
I'm missing the other good ones, but

1029
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,000
there's, you know, his Yeah. So, he

1030
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:26,719
basically five strains, five years.

1031
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,079
Really impressive. Took and put in the

1032
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,719
effort and took the time to do it

1033
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,960
correctly. And, you know, I think made

1034
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,639
huge impacts on on the world we live in

1035
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,320
today. Guys like me, I mean, I make a

1036
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,319
lot of outcrosses. We do 300 plus

1037
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,320
outcrosses a year. Yeah. you know, and

1038
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,838
so and then besides that with the

1039
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,079
autoflower varieties and we're doing

1040
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,000
inbreeding with those and yeah, there's

1041
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,680
so much work that goes on, but it's so

1042
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,239
beyond me these days. It's like the

1043
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,078
skills are so beyond it can go as deep

1044
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,559
as you want and then you start involving

1045
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,119
testing, you know, and then it just

1046
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:00,400
starts getting expensive. That starts

1047
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:04,559
cutting up. Yeah. The AK was uh so my

1048
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,639
M80 is GDP times AK, right? So, and when

1049
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,358
that when I popped that, it was the most

1050
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,078
beautiful purple, yellow, and

1051
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:11,759
orangehaired, you know, and then I

1052
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,440
started and and then I started working

1053
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,800
on stabilization. I know I didn't have

1054
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,320
anybody teaching me this [ __ ] you know?

1055
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,240
I'm just hearing things back then.

1056
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:23,599
Totally. And then, uh, Meno Perp was AK

1057
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:27,118
times AK was my M1000. And it was these

1058
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:30,000
black hand grenade. I mean, they were

1059
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,800
just hang grenade, right? black with

1060
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,880
yellow and and orange hairs popping out

1061
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,240
of it. Yeah, Meno was wild back in the

1062
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,800
90s. I remember going to pick up some

1063
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,719
Meno purse with my buddy Steve and I was

1064
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,400
driving and we had to go to a parking

1065
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,480
lot and this is before cell phones, too.

1066
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,639
So, we had pagers. I believe we had

1067
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,079
pagers back then, but basically we had

1068
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,679
to go to this parking lot and the guy

1069
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,960
would shine a light and we had to walk

1070
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,039
get out of the car, walk towards the

1071
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,639
light, he'd come behind us and then we'd

1072
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,599
do the exchange or whatever. And this is

1073
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:00,879
like, you know, or 94 93 something like

1074
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,559
that. And Menoper, I don't What was

1075
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,320
Menoper? You know what? I don't have a

1076
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,400
[ __ ] clue. I still ask that question

1077
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,240
today. So, it's like there's been I

1078
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,760
think almost I don't know. And there's

1079
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,679
answers out there. I just, you know, I

1080
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,920
just don't know what I do know. I have

1081
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,440
not gotten a good answer from anybody. I

1082
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,680
can't give you that answer. And it's not

1083
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,519
it's the funny thing is it's not GDP.

1084
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,078
It's not Blackberry Kush. It's not any

1085
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:24,400
of the It's not um So, there was the

1086
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,079
purple cush. It's not purple kush. It's

1087
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,680
its own thing, right? But there was also

1088
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,800
several probably different iterations.

1089
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,879
That's what I'm saying. There was a lot

1090
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
of people called menoper. Meno perb. So

1091
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,880
there was a lot of varietals of menoper.

1092
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,800
So I don't even know originally, you

1093
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,400
know, where my menoper came from. I just

1094
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,560
know that it had great bag appeal and

1095
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,480
was awesome. And it was expensive too.

1096
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,639
Like back in the 90s it was still top

1097
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,240
top dollar. That was when outdoor was

1098
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,719
more expensive than indoor at certain

1099
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,719
times of the year. Yeah. Totally. So

1100
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,159
yeah. Good I mean I now we were just

1101
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:57,919
reminiscing not long ago about price

1102
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:00,559
points and uh you know USVI sending few

1103
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,720
pounds at a time 7500 bucks like that

1104
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,078
was that was hitting up there and I I

1105
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:09,199
remember um it was in the in the almost

1106
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,800
mid 2000s early 2000s getting you know I

1107
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,679
remember when it would dropped to like

1108
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,119
3,800 bucks a pound for indoor and and

1109
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:19,279
it was perp back then and and I was like

1110
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,680
I'll never [ __ ] do this again. I we

1111
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,119
realize how much how wealthy I was, you

1112
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,358
know, because I back then I was young

1113
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,519
dumb burning through so much cash,

1114
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,519
right? The shoe boxes of Benjamins would

1115
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:33,280
like come and go constantly. It was like

1116
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,639
it was like we never went without. Well,

1117
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,880
and I think when you're at a young age

1118
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,639
and you get money so quickly, you don't

1119
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,640
understand the value of a dollar. I I

1120
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:43,679
was kind of in the same boat. Yeah. And

1121
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,879
you don't appreciate what you have. Uh,

1122
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,799
and it only takes one time losing it to

1123
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,240
start appreciating it. And I think that

1124
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,880
then, you know, you lose it a couple

1125
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,639
times. I' I've lost my money several

1126
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,519
times. We I've made money, made good

1127
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,879
money, and then lost it all. Uh, those

1128
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,000
are all good learning experiences. I

1129
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,640
understand the value of a dollar now,

1130
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,239
but I'm also 47, right? So, it would

1131
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,039
have been much nicer had I been, you

1132
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,319
know, 20 and put a lot more away. But,

1133
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,838
you know, these things, it's like it's

1134
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,200
it's life and that's what life's all

1135
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,039
about. And, I mean, it's been a

1136
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,759
beautiful journey. [ __ ] comes and goes,

1137
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,639
man. Long strange trip to say the least.

1138
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,960
Yeah, totally. So, let's talk about uh

1139
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,279
Soil King and where that started, how

1140
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,240
you evolved from growing everything into

1141
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,359
starting a soil business.

1142
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:32,078
I was in it was 08 housing turn, you

1143
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,759
know, uh when when that crashed, I was

1144
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,280
builder developer again. I've been a

1145
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,480
I've been a millionaire multiple times

1146
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,680
in my life and um and I've lost it,

1147
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,800
right? And the '08 downturn, it was it

1148
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,319
was grow food, grow weed. And then as

1149
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,880
soon as that started happen, and I was

1150
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,119
like, and I think my John Jennings, a

1151
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,358
good friend of

1152
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,800
mine, he says he he coined me the soil

1153
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,358
king, right? I don't remember when that

1154
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,720
was 20 2007, I think, something like

1155
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,880
that is when it was Soil King

1156
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:06,239
20067. And I was really passionate. I

1157
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,559
started back I I started a mix line

1158
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,799
called Marley Mix. Nice. had Marley

1159
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,799
Moonshine, Marley Shroom Bloom, and I

1160
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,400
was, you know, it was a good, it was a

1161
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
good mix. And I was sourcing everything

1162
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,480
through municipality green waste of dump

1163
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,880
sites, right? And when and that was

1164
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,880
before I really had an understanding of,

1165
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,880
you know, glyphosates, pesticides,

1166
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,960
herbicides, you know, all this avid

1167
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,440
every all this [ __ ] that was just so

1168
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,599
toxic. And when I started unraveling

1169
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,079
that onion, I immediately just like

1170
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,599
said, "My god, this is this is my

1171
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,400
calling. This is what I need to do." And

1172
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,440
I was back then I I got rid of those

1173
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,280
lines and I'm like I I can't I I got to

1174
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,838
I got to scrap all this and start over.

1175
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,079
And so I started designing Big Root soil

1176
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,159
being, you know, super tested. I tested

1177
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,280
back then for GMO, right? It was like

1178
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:58,639
crazy the testing I did pre Prop 64 and

1179
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,240
pre everybody and to the point where I

1180
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,519
got hated by a lot of people in the

1181
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,439
Emerald Triangle. Uh because I I owned a

1182
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,599
garden center. This is kind of a pet

1183
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,280
peeve in in the industry through the 215

1184
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,760
movement where we all got rich on, you

1185
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,079
know, we can grow 90 up to 99 plants.

1186
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,359
And so I had seven patches in 99. That

1187
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,280
was like the limit with everybody's

1188
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,799
scripts all over, you know, and I'm

1189
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
living in the mountains and I'm and I'm

1190
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,318
doing all this. But I would I was

1191
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,239
growing fully organic and I had

1192
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,318
conscious cultivating and I wasn't using

1193
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,919
Avid. I mean, you know, everybody was

1194
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,440
using all this stuff and I had a garden

1195
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,039
center where people coming in mad

1196
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,800
because they can't buy this [ __ ] from

1197
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:37,119
me. Avid. And so in the 215 movement,

1198
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,079
it's a medical movement, right? We're

1199
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,039
growing medicinal plants and people are

1200
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,119
putting things that are carcen that are

1201
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,759
killing you in the name of medicine on

1202
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,240
the plant to take down the bug pressure,

1203
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,920
right? It was it was insane how much

1204
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,519
people were putting of this [ __ ] You

1205
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,159
know, when you got to put a whole suit

1206
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,000
on and you're spraying your plants and

1207
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,759
you're smoking it, I mean, logic and

1208
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,079
common sense says you're a [ __ ]

1209
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,079
idiot. Yeah. Right. It really is. And so

1210
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,079
the 215 movement was about making money

1211
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,760
in the name of medicine and killing

1212
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,400
people in the name of medicine instead.

1213
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,920
So I was kind of for me I was I was

1214
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,760
coming through that era and I was

1215
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,599
preaching this you know you guys are

1216
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,839
[ __ ] stupid for this. This is what

1217
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,440
you're doing and and I was getting hated

1218
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,679
because ignorance cuz it was just plain

1219
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,318
ignorance. It's like how smoking was so

1220
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,919
accepted in the 40s and 50s and 60s.

1221
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,679
Smoking cigarettes, smoking on

1222
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,559
airplanes, smoking indoors, all that

1223
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:34,000
[ __ ] and how bad it was. It's it's very

1224
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,000
comparable to all the avid Eagle 20.

1225
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,679
Eagle 20 all that [ __ ] that they used to

1226
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,838
use the trifectas that they used to

1227
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,679
combine to spray on their plants that

1228
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,279
they were basically poisoning people not

1229
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:44,879
knowing it with most most of the people

1230
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,079
actually had good intentions. They

1231
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,480
didn't understand that they were

1232
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,318
poisoning their customers. Yeah. I mean,

1233
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,159
when they found a guy like me, they

1234
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,679
realized it real quick as I was calling

1235
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:57,440
them out and and that was kind of the

1236
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,598
downfall was uh you know, I was testing

1237
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,119
when testing was coming online. SC Labs,

1238
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,000
I was trying to get you know, we had

1239
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,039
what was the names out of Steep Hill

1240
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,400
Labs right back and then before Yeah. I

1241
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,079
mean, then then yeah, there was the

1242
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,880
Steep Hill and and there was what's her

1243
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,640
name in Santa Rosa.

1244
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,440
She her and her husband had a lab.

1245
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,279
Anyways, I'm I'm testing for this stuff.

1246
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,039
I'm producing I'm at the Emerald Cup.

1247
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,800
I'm producing product. We're squishing

1248
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,400
it. We're squishing flour back then.

1249
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,280
Kind of where we started, right? Yeah.

1250
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,800
Trying to went from went from CIF to ice

1251
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,480
water hash and trying to figure out

1252
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,318
squishing flour, concentrating

1253
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,240
pesticides, you know. I think Yeah, that

1254
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,759
was it. It's concentrating pesticides.

1255
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,639
So, when I was in Northern I was at the

1256
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,400
Emerald Cup and I was showing testing of

1257
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,078
no pesticide levels and I'm trying to

1258
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,760
get into this and really no lab was

1259
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,839
really accurate, but we're I'm talking a

1260
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,520
lot about this and I had a lot of people

1261
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:50,719
that were angry because they said I was

1262
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:52,480
trying to one up the industry by saying

1263
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,919
this my shit's better because of this

1264
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,318
and there was a lot of knowledge that

1265
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,039
just kind of rejected that look because

1266
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,800
we were making [ __ ] money. Like we

1267
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,920
were making money. It was like we were

1268
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,160
getting paid money per unit and we're

1269
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,240
growing [ __ ] units like right

1270
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,078
crashing it. But in order to get to the

1271
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,719
finish line, it's easy to suit up and

1272
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:16,079
you know and throw some pesticide. Oh,

1273
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:19,118
so many people ship it out. No. And and

1274
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,920
so early on, my mentor and someone who I

1275
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,480
really believed in was my aunt. And

1276
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,838
she's been preaching organics since '

1277
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,440
91, since I first started smoking and

1278
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,440
she always talked about organics, you

1279
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,119
know, from I'm sure from back in the 70s

1280
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,838
even talking about organics and growing

1281
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,920
your own and doing it right and staying

1282
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,599
away from all the dumb [ __ ] So yeah,

1283
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,039
it's Yeah. And there was a lot of people

1284
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,480
like that that were out there that did.

1285
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,400
I mean, Emerald Triangle was full of

1286
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,880
generational family farms that are no

1287
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,960
longer in existence, but it was like the

1288
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,800
the organic, you know, they didn't go to

1289
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,559
the grocery, they didn't go to the the

1290
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,920
hydro store, the garden centers for

1291
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,358
stuff, man. If they needed some, they

1292
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,559
made it right there.

1293
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:01,519
Sustainability, all of it came off the

1294
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,358
farm, you know, and it was it was it was

1295
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,199
a difference. So, organics was always

1296
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,039
there and I could tap into the Swamies

1297
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,799
and Nikki of the world, right? I can get

1298
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,000
into that, but there was just so much

1299
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,760
money being made, you know, of of in

1300
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,039
that. So, I don't know, not to not to

1301
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,359
keep going down that line. Then we

1302
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,440
transitioned into the the prop 64 and I

1303
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,838
was the first, you know, seed to soul up

1304
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,599
in Cloverdale, California, was the first

1305
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:26,880
micro license, if not the very first,

1306
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,800
which I'm pretty sure it is. It's like

1307
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,400
the top one or two that was given in the

1308
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,280
Cal in state of California when

1309
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:37,358
licensing happened. and I prepared my

1310
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,119
city uh for Prop 64 to be accepted. So,

1311
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,279
we were we were the first city in the

1312
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,880
state of California when Prop 64 was

1313
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,160
approved to allow licensing to move

1314
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,000
forward. And that process to me was huge

1315
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,039
because I had to I had to, you know,

1316
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,280
years prior I had to educate my

1317
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,679
community and educate uh the council.

1318
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,280
You know, I had there was a four out of

1319
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,399
five no vote forever. Didn't want

1320
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,920
anything to do with it. And I kept

1321
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,838
showing up at the podium. a few people

1322
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,920
in Cloverdale would come in, you know,

1323
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:07,039
Dorian would would support it and Oh,

1324
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,200
yeah. going back from before to get the

1325
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,358
city, you know, ready to it. Everybody

1326
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,960
said no. The city council said, "Well,

1327
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,960
this isn't going to work." And the c the

1328
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,880
city or the city manager came to me and

1329
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,000
said, "Look, here's here's the deal. If

1330
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,640
if you think you can get your

1331
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,358
constituents in the city to approve

1332
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,639
Props approve legalization of cannabis,

1333
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,159
we can have your back, but we don't

1334
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,159
believe that's where it is." And I said,

1335
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,639
"Good. I'll put Proposition P on the

1336
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,480
ballot. And that was 2016. I put

1337
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,279
Proposition P on the ballot and we got

1338
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,119
over half of our city that approved

1339
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,960
cannabis and wanted it. I walked in and

1340
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,400
said, "Well, we're moving forward on

1341
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,880
this now. You're putting money where

1342
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,800
your mouth is, right?" And and we did we

1343
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,960
did that. And so the city was completely

1344
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,160
in and prepared. And and just take one

1345
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,159
step before that was uh building bridges

1346
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,399
with law enforcement. Chief of Police of

1347
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,159
of Cloverdale, California. He died from

1348
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,358
cancer. Eight rounds of cancer from the

1349
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,279
walkie-talkie on his neck. Right. So, he

1350
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:05,039
came to me. I got arrested. I It's like

1351
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,160
2014. I got arrested for cannabis again.

1352
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,318
And and I had the garden center open.

1353
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,159
And I'm a I'm on the boys and I'm on the

1354
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,159
boys and girls club. I'm on the board of

1355
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,399
directors. I'm a longtime Lions club

1356
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,719
member. I'm a coach in little league,

1357
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,160
you know, softball and doing all that.

1358
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:22,719
And I'm building houses in the

1359
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,159
community. And here I am uh this

1360
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,919
cannabis guy getting arrested for

1361
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,598
cannabis as a garden center. Like

1362
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,838
nothing really made sense. So he came to

1363
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,720
me and said came to me. I remember he

1364
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:34,239
came to me and said look

1365
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:36,558
man why are you so passionate about

1366
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:39,279
this? I said because this is going to

1367
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,680
save lives. I am this is my passion and

1368
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,680
my purpose and I'll never give up on the

1369
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,078
plant not just cannabis but all across

1370
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,639
the board I will put everything. At that

1371
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,599
time I had, you know, my I was my kids

1372
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:53,679
were coming home crying saying that that

1373
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,920
uh you know my dad's going to, you know,

1374
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,919
be in prison the rest of his life. You

1375
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,838
know, all and he's hearing this from

1376
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,079
teachers and things at school. I had the

1377
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,759
DARE program telling my my daughter

1378
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,800
raised her hand in the DARE program and

1379
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,200
said, you know, my mom has uh struggled

1380
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,640
with opiate addiction and cannabis has

1381
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,318
helped her with that. And I witnessed it

1382
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,598
and he laughed, told her to sit down and

1383
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,279
never say anything like that again. She

1384
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,519
didn't know what she was talking about.

1385
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,680
And so I had to I I actually would go in

1386
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,639
and sit into the DARE programs, right? I

1387
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,799
would I would be educating officers on

1388
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,879
what cannabis actually is back then. So

1389
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,559
all this stuff happened and when the

1390
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,079
chief of police came over, he goes, "Why

1391
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,079
are you willing to give up everything?

1392
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,839
Like you you you got money, you built a

1393
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,160
[ __ ] you you built a subdivision

1394
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,358
here, like you're you know, your highest

1395
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:38,799
standards are up, but then you're

1396
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,159
cutting yourself off." I then I told

1397
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,318
him, "Man, I'll never give up on this.

1398
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:44,639
This is my one thing in life that I will

1399
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:47,279
follow through to the end." Yeah. and he

1400
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,799
stepped up from the from the table.

1401
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,079
We're sitting across just like this. He

1402
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,720
stepped up, put his hands out, and he

1403
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,559
says, "How can I assist you?" Right? And

1404
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,558
at that moment, that's bridge building

1405
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,640
101 that came in. And I said, "First

1406
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:03,599
off, we need to quit. You by you you

1407
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:06,639
forcing people to to uh grow weed

1408
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:10,880
indoors with numbers and forcing them,

1409
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:12,879
you are pro you are you are having kids

1410
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,440
doors kicked in and kids taken away from

1411
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,318
the family over this plant and even more

1412
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,000
so you all the electrical fires cuz in

1413
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,239
Cloverdale at that time it was one in

1414
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,639
seven houses that were growing indoors.

1415
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,639
Those are those are huge numbers, right?

1416
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,879
And I said, "Not one of these people

1417
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,920
that you go in and kick their doors in

1418
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,838
has has good electrical. You're you're

1419
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,760
you guys are forcing neighborhoods to

1420
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,078
get burnt down." Yeah. Right. You can't

1421
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,599
call a licensed, you know, electrician

1422
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,200
because he's going to ratch you out. So

1423
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,720
now you got all these ballast and all

1424
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,639
these wiring and all this [ __ ] in the

1425
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:48,480
houses and uh and it's time to to you

1426
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,318
guys are the problem, not us. [ __ ] your

1427
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,800
plant count. let's get growing outdoor

1428
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,960
in the backyard and let's talk about

1429
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,359
pesticides and contaminants. And we

1430
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,440
wrote, him and I wrote the ordinance and

1431
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,358
it was the first ordinance written in

1432
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,280
the world that said in cannabis

1433
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:08,239
cultivation there's no pesticides or

1434
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,240
herbicide use within the city limits of

1435
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,159
Cloverdale. We put that language in

1436
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,239
there and and what happened is now we

1437
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:16,318
ended up allowing six plants to grow

1438
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,000
outdoors. Yeah. So now people were

1439
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,400
growing outdoors. the complaints of the

1440
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,920
neighbors were, you know, he he got it.

1441
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,639
He says, "Oh, well, we can deal with

1442
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,480
complaints over the neighbors or faulty

1443
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,879
[ __ ] wiring in a house that's going

1444
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,119
to burn it down." It was a no it was a

1445
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,200
no-brainer, right? Yeah. Like logic,

1446
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,880
like throw logic out there. And he goes,

1447
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:36,799
"Would you would you help me try to

1448
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,358
figure this out?" So, next thing you

1449
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,359
know, him and I are friends and his

1450
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,279
officers are hating me because of it.

1451
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,519
Oh, I bet. Right. They [ __ ] hated me.

1452
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,319
So, all of a sudden, I told I have the

1453
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,440
garden center in Clover. I'm telling

1454
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,199
everybody, call me up if you're getting

1455
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,358
raided. We're going to figure this [ __ ]

1456
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:55,039
out. So, these officers are kicking in

1457
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:56,719
doors still and their chief's not

1458
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,639
allowing it, right? And it's a it's a

1459
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,879
mess. And I'm getting phone calls and

1460
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,480
I'm running over there and I'm calling

1461
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,480
the chief of police and I'm saying,

1462
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,119
"Man, this is [ __ ] [ __ ] right?"

1463
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,039
And so, they would take pictures of a

1464
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,318
Avid or whatever and they'd send me

1465
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,279
pictures, you know, because there's no

1466
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,719
use of it in Cloverdale, California. And

1467
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,480
then I would go over to the house and

1468
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,078
I'd educate on the house instead of

1469
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,838
instead of arresting them for things. So

1470
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,359
it was a whole educational thing. This

1471
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:25,679
is pre-prop 64. So you know it's crazy.

1472
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,920
It's crazy. It was crazy times to the

1473
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:31,118
point I with the same chief of police.

1474
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,000
He he uh I gave him cannabis and made

1475
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:38,318
RSO on the side. um because I was

1476
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,159
treating his his uh his cancer, but he

1477
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,599
nobody could know about it because he

1478
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,960
would lose his pension and he knew he

1479
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,039
was probably going to die and his family

1480
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,318
would lose all that, right? So, we kept

1481
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:49,920
that on the under. And then I

1482
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:51,440
remember through uh one time when we

1483
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,000
were getting all licensed just right

1484
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,960
before Prop 64 was approved, Beasel

1485
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,440
Dorian was getting raided and all the

1486
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,599
cops were up there raiding him. And I I

1487
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,039
called up uh the chief of police and I

1488
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,440
said, "Man, this just ain't going to go.

1489
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:07,358
You got to call these guys off." And he

1490
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,440
actually radioed in and saved Dorian

1491
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:11,119
from getting raided that time. Wild,

1492
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,440
right? So, I mean, you look at this

1493
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,280
outlaw, you know, from me being a a

1494
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,639
convict to an outlaw to

1495
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,800
pioneering and having to build bridges

1496
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,519
with people I never trusted who always

1497
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,680
were against me. That's big [ __ ] man.

1498
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,599
It's like those are proud mo moments of

1499
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,598
my life to get this industry from where

1500
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,240
it was to where it is. And I played a

1501
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,838
small part, but I did that part. But

1502
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,279
it's all small parts. Yeah, it's all

1503
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:36,960
small part. All of this is all small

1504
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,119
parts. It's all of us doing our part,

1505
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,639
right? I feel like

1506
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,160
the these passionate people out there

1507
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,920
that are very devotional to the plant,

1508
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,279
it's all part of the bigger picture and

1509
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,200
it's all part of moving the plant

1510
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,040
forward. And you know, I think we're

1511
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,039
just stewards of the plant in regards

1512
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,558
like we don't own this [ __ ] We're just

1513
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,920
moving the plant forward. We're we're

1514
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,519
just trying to advance the plant to

1515
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,960
where it should be and where it will be

1516
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:58,880
and where it will be and which is pretty

1517
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,280
amazing. You know, it's like we we saw,

1518
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,240
you know, 215 for people that weren't

1519
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,040
there. 96 that was the first kind of

1520
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:08,719
vision where it's like in California,

1521
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,400
this is going to be legal someday.

1522
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,879
Dennis Peron, man, hammered that one

1523
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,880
down. Y like crazy times back then. It

1524
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,200
was the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco

1525
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,440
and they had the the club, what was it

1526
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,879
called? Where the the where the pot shop

1527
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,200
was. They got people like Jerry Mum from

1528
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,920
Meno Seeds and you know all all them

1529
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,719
were producers of of that. So they

1530
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,720
produced cannabis for the 215 and they

1531
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:34,558
had a house that Dennis Prone used to

1532
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,078
sell weed out of in San Francisco over

1533
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,720
off of the Tenderloin. Not the

1534
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,880
Tenderloin but I forget Poke Street or

1535
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:43,199
whatever it was. And yeah, and that was

1536
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,680
where the 215 movement really came and

1537
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:49,199
and and it saved people's I mean

1538
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:52,318
cannabis, cannabis, cannabis, cancer,

1539
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:54,799
cannabis, you know, uh AIDS, all that

1540
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:57,358
plays a super part. My my mother passed

1541
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,359
away. We from cancer. I carried her out

1542
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,318
of this

1543
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:02,558
world, you know. That's where I don't

1544
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:04,000
know if you remember mama's boy 20 to1

1545
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,839
came in. She didn't really want to smoke

1546
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,358
cannabis. So I came up and I started

1547
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:08,960
working with a few people. Lawrence

1548
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,598
Ringo was one of them. got some of his

1549
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,760
cuts and started working on really on

1550
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,160
with some people on really good CBD

1551
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,839
lines back then and and uh I came up

1552
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,598
with Mama's Boy. Mama's Boy was actually

1553
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:22,639
a squisher that didn't turn to oil. You

1554
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:26,160
can actually wash it and get consistency

1555
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:28,639
of of of rosin. It was crazy back then.

1556
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:31,118
It was and it ranged at 20 to1. And so

1557
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,279
that was my mom smoked that. We made

1558
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,119
tinctures. We did all that. and she she

1559
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,200
didn't take her chemo or anything, but

1560
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:40,160
she lessened herself on the

1561
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,759
pharmaceutical uh drugs, you know, and

1562
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,000
she was able I was able to carry her out

1563
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,400
of this world. So, it works so well hand

1564
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,760
in hand with these things, you know? You

1565
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,440
don't need to die out on

1566
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,599
pharmaceuticals. I mean, cannabis

1567
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,920
[ __ ] really saves lives and makes end

1568
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,400
of death a lot easier. And it makes the

1569
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,760
world a better place. It's hard to argue

1570
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,119
that, you know, it's like there's still

1571
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,280
people that are trying to hold on to

1572
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,798
whatever they heard from back in the 60s

1573
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,040
and 70s and 80s, you know, the the the

1574
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:08,400
war on drugs. Yeah. It makes the world a

1575
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:11,039
better place. And if you if you look

1576
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,358
into it and you actually look into it,

1577
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,880
even guy Sanjay Gupta talking about

1578
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,039
these kids that have, you know,

1579
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,200
seizures, like really bad seizures, and

1580
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,119
how this plant can take away those

1581
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,118
seizures. How can you argue with it's

1582
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,039
it's you can't you can't or you're a

1583
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,798
[ __ ] up person or you're a bad person

1584
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,119
and you might just be a bad person if

1585
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,639
you don't agree that a parent should be

1586
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,160
allowed to give their kid a drug that

1587
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,358
takes away their seizures that has very

1588
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:37,279
minimal side effects. Totally man like

1589
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:39,838
that's where right speaking of Lawrence

1590
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,400
Ringo. Yeah. That's where uh that's

1591
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,759
where the Stanley brothers came in with

1592
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,798
Charlotte's Charlotte's Web and

1593
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,799
Charlotte's Web was actually produced by

1594
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:50,239
Lawrence Ringo. Did you know that? You

1595
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:51,599
probably know that whole story and that

1596
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:53,279
stuff that came down. I have a good

1597
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,920
friend, my friend Eric was involved with

1598
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,319
that mess and Yeah. Yeah. And at the end

1599
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,480
of the day, we all were upset and the,

1600
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,159
you know, Lawrence before he passed away

1601
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,639
said, "If it saves a [ __ ] child, who

1602
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,318
gives a fuck?" Yeah. Saves one child. Do

1603
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,838
you think I care about me being attached

1604
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:09,759
to any of that? No. And how can you

1605
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:12,000
argue that? You can't argue it. It was a

1606
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,000
it was a life lessons from an elder to

1607
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
me that I'm able to process and think

1608
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,798
about as I'm getting older in my time

1609
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,440
and apply that you know respons

1610
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:23,759
responsibility of a mindset to things

1611
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,480
that come up in my life. Like that's

1612
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,280
powerful. Yeah. Like you know he's like

1613
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,679
Charlotte's Web Lawrence Ringo.

1614
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,798
Yeah. Right. Who gives a [ __ ] Did it

1615
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:38,000
save her? Did it help her? Gives a [ __ ]

1616
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:39,679
Yeah. Exactly. That's that's uh that's

1617
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,719
special right there. You know, that's a

1618
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:44,879
lesson to be learned. And now we've got

1619
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,719
Germany going legal. They're not even

1620
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,480
going legal. They are a recreational

1621
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,118
country. They're they're the biggest

1622
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,639
recreational country. Uh but I see other

1623
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,000
countries ready to follow suit. You

1624
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,400
know, obviously there's Canada, there's

1625
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,838
Portugal, there's South Africa, and some

1626
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,798
of those are medical, some of them are

1627
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:03,039
recreational, but uh I mean, you know,

1628
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,719
Canada big big one as well. And and

1629
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,199
we're still not recreational on a

1630
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:09,919
federal level here. That will change.

1631
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,919
Yeah. Hopefully within the next 3 years.

1632
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,358
Yeah. You know, maybe four. We say that

1633
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,798
every three or four years. I know. Every

1634
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:17,440
time we have a new president, it's like,

1635
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:19,119
oh, next four years we'll have it. I I

1636
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,798
would hope that within the next four

1637
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,400
years they have it figured out or at the

1638
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:24,400
very least there's interstate commerce

1639
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,039
allowed, right? Has to be interstate

1640
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,280
commerce allowed. There has to be. and

1641
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,358
the commodity of of you know the

1642
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,079
commodity of agriculture versus the

1643
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:35,759
commodity of cannabis. It just it I mean

1644
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,920
that system doesn't work. Look at

1645
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,720
California, right? Like I I'm invested

1646
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,119
in here. I've lost millions. I'm still

1647
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:44,719
standing and and and the only the only

1648
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,720
success story out of here is the state

1649
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,399
of California. Yeah. Like really that's

1650
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:49,759
the only success story. They put us all

1651
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,240
out of business. Was it purposely

1652
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,799
driven? Absolutely. Was it Were we

1653
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:57,598
ripped off for our votes? 100%. Are we

1654
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:59,920
still being manipulated for votes and

1655
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,720
Yeah, absolutely. Like we're, you know,

1656
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,960
we got overt taxed.

1657
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:08,159
Come on, man. Like, it's ridiculous.

1658
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,720
Why? There's no reason that we shouldn't

1659
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,639
be selling weed at farmers markets. Oh,

1660
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,719
I know. That's that's the silliest thing

1661
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,000
ever, right? That we can't you you or

1662
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:18,159
that you can't go to the farm and buy

1663
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,880
directly from the farmer. No, no sense.

1664
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:23,679
It makes zero sense, you know, except

1665
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,838
for from a taxation standpoint. like,

1666
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:28,399
"Well, we need to tax three times before

1667
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:30,078
it gets to the consumer." I I get it.

1668
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,880
That's that's what they want to do. But

1669
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,720
that's not right. When I was paying more

1670
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,160
in taxes for a pound of weed than I

1671
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,318
could sell a pound of weed for a few

1672
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,399
years ago in my facility, I knew that's

1673
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,239
the problem. Yeah. Right. When the cog

1674
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,039
just didn't work. And and in cannabis,

1675
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:49,039
we've come to a point in business. in

1676
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:52,639
any other business mentality, 10 cents,

1677
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:55,920
you know, an ROI or 10% ROI, you can run

1678
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:58,000
a business on projections of 10%. Nobody

1679
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,599
in their right mind would say, "Well,

1680
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,519
that's a business I want to get into."

1681
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,480
Right. Right. In cannabis, we're seeing

1682
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:05,920
that 10% and we say, "We can make this

1683
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,838
work. We're going to work harder, team."

1684
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,599
Right. Restaurant industry and the

1685
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:10,960
cannabis industry do so well together.

1686
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,200
You know, the people in them, both of

1687
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,079
them. Yeah. 10%. I think restaurants is

1688
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:18,558
like 5 to 7% right now. Yeah. Right. But

1689
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,640
California did pull the cultivation tax

1690
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,240
in June. Yeah. Which is a good thing.

1691
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,318
Yeah. You know, I think there's things

1692
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,759
we're doing we're stepping in the right

1693
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:28,079
direction in a lot of ways, but there's

1694
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,240
also things we need to fix, right? Like

1695
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,200
the fact that they're allowing uh

1696
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:34,639
they're allowing uh cannabis cafes. I

1697
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:36,159
think that's amazing. I think we need

1698
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:38,078
cannabis cafes. We're just not allowing

1699
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:40,159
them quick enough. No. the process of

1700
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,720
it. We the bureaucrats going through the

1701
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:44,239
city approval process and yeah, you

1702
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,399
know, and then getting you have to wait

1703
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,239
for us. Too much red tape for that.

1704
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Yeah. It's just too much too much. But

1705
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:53,358
that's why you moved out of state. I

1706
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,480
love that. Yeah. I mean, I came here and

1707
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:58,558
I had the garden center through co up in

1708
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,119
Cloverdale. And what is that when you're

1709
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,960
a grocery store, you're you can allow to

1710
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,400
be open because you're providing what

1711
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,199
it's there's a word for that type of

1712
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:10,599
business and like a co-op. No, it was

1713
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:12,960
like you're essentual essential

1714
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:14,480
business. Essential business, right? So,

1715
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,000
you were essential during I was

1716
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,199
completely essential because I'm

1717
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,798
teaching people how to grow food in

1718
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:21,199
their backyard and I'm teaching people

1719
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:23,440
how to grow cannabis and I'm producing

1720
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,519
all that. I'm selling veggie starts. I'm

1721
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,280
doing all of it. And the city comes in

1722
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,559
to me and says, "Look, you're going to

1723
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,798
have to shut your store down. You're not

1724
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,519
an essential business, right?" And I'm

1725
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,358
like, "Hey, get the [ __ ] out." Like,

1726
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,039
just shut the [ __ ] up and leave. So they

1727
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,719
came back at the cops coming there too.

1728
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,719
Same thing. I went out threw fit in the

1729
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:42,719
parking lot. Get the [ __ ] out of here. I

1730
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,039
refused to put on a mask. Not that I'm

1731
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,118
that guy, but I refused to be told what

1732
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:49,679
I what I was going to have to do. And I

1733
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,400
was the essential tool in our area. And

1734
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:54,558
I was growing vegetables, you know, [ __ ]

1735
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,960
tons of vegetables and giving it away to

1736
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,160
people like like that is where the move

1737
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,318
needed to be. and and so, you know, I

1738
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,719
that was one of the factors going

1739
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:07,279
through that was one of the reasons I

1740
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:09,118
feel like I didn't I was I didn't want

1741
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,160
to do business in California because

1742
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,240
California didn't have my back. Uh EPA

1743
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,000
being a compost producer and things. I

1744
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,798
you know, it was just so much regulation

1745
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,400
and taxation on me at every angle. And

1746
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:23,199
here I'm trying to be an honest business

1747
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:26,400
where people are dropping $50,000 in a

1748
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:28,318
paper sack for soil and I'm putting it

1749
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,559
in the bank and I'm paying taxes on it,

1750
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,119
you know, and and I'm trying to build

1751
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,119
this business and be that person and and

1752
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,280
you know, California's just and city

1753
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,640
just they just didn't want to be a good

1754
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:43,280
partner. And so I needed to to exit this

1755
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:47,078
plus we had the downturn and we had the

1756
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:50,160
fallout of cannabis. And 2021 my

1757
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:51,359
projection in 2021 when the when we

1758
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,440
started you know the downturn of

1759
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,920
cannabis started happening in 22 I made

1760
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,318
I think I made 5.5 million almost $6

1761
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,400
million in soil sales and my

1762
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:02,318
projections. So, I had to buy inputs and

1763
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:05,440
I'm building up for the next projection

1764
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:08,079
of 2022 at 8 million, right? I made

1765
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,880
$80,000 in sales and my projection was 8

1766
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,640
million. So, immediately, you know, it

1767
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,400
was turning to switch off. So, you know,

1768
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,440
you remember I had the house boats on

1769
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:20,480
Lake Soma, ski boats, you know, all the

1770
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:25,200
[ __ ] I had and buildings and houses and,

1771
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,159
you know, lake houses and all that stuff

1772
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:27,759
went by.

1773
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:30,920
You're not the only one. So many of our

1774
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:33,599
friends, so many people that we know

1775
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,559
basically scaled up uh cultivation

1776
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,480
facilities, bought new locations, bought

1777
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,160
buildings outright because co was so

1778
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,400
good for the industry and we thought it

1779
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,318
was never going to end a lot of us and

1780
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,760
then we got cut off at the knees. And I

1781
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:47,838
did that with seed to sil you know all

1782
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,400
my money I made I built out, you know, I

1783
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,318
built out a cannabis facility. I did I

1784
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,318
had my nursery set up in there. We were

1785
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:58,159
the first uh facility pumping rosin into

1786
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:00,159
the legal market in the state of

1787
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:02,078
California. I can remediate. I started

1788
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:04,000
in there and I was putting all my money

1789
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,798
in building up cannabis at the same

1790
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,440
time. Diver, I was diversified when the

1791
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:11,358
collapse happened and it hit me at, you

1792
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,358
know, at every angle. It really did,

1793
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:17,440
man. It just crushed me at every angle.

1794
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:19,199
And you know so Arizona wasn't so you

1795
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,599
know it was a getting out of California

1796
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,838
is needed for mental my mental health

1797
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,079
for sure at that time you know I went

1798
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:30,880
through I'm 22 I went through suicide

1799
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:34,000
attempt and uh you know I was I lost I

1800
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,480
lost everything and and uh had to go I

1801
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,119
had bankrupt uh my business up in

1802
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:42,719
Northern California on that one and and

1803
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:44,640
it just was it was really hard to there

1804
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:46,000
was no road maps. There's no anything on

1805
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:47,838
how to get through this type of

1806
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,599
industry, right? You can search YouTube

1807
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:51,038
for how do you get through what do you

1808
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,440
you know I'm talking to attorneys. Every

1809
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:56,000
attorney wants $5,000 and they all have

1810
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,358
a different objective of how I'm going

1811
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,760
to get through something and they're all

1812
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:03,038
full of [ __ ] man. Right. And so I

1813
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,880
that's kind of where you know Arizona

1814
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,680
went out there and I'm like I I started

1815
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,160
the bu the podcast my podcast built for

1816
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:12,399
this and it was named out it was named

1817
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:15,118
soil king legends of legacy where I was

1818
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,680
doing panels of discussion panels all

1819
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,440
over the country of uh you know legend

1820
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,598
legends of legacy panels of soil king

1821
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,358
where I'd have influencers out and then

1822
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,838
I was going to start the podcast called

1823
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:29,159
soil king legends of legacy and my my

1824
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:32,400
mentor Dr. Greg Reid, he said,

1825
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:34,000
"Man, he's like, this was a this was a

1826
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,880
year and a half, year ago or so, a

1827
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,480
little over a year ago." He goes,

1828
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,160
"What's the one thing that you wanted to

1829
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,079
do that you haven't gotten off the

1830
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:41,519
ground yet?" I'm like, "Man, I'm just

1831
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,200
trying to survive." He goes, "Give me

1832
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:45,038
one thing." And I'm like, "Well, it's a

1833
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:47,038
podcast." And this was a Thursday night.

1834
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,480
He's my mentor. And he goes, "Good. You

1835
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:52,480
got till Tuesday to have your first

1836
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:54,960
podcast recorded." I had no studio. I

1837
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,719
had nothing. And I hustled and I figured

1838
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,720
it out. And when as the time I was

1839
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,719
figuring it out, I was like, "Do I want

1840
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,318
it to be Soil King Legends Legacy

1841
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,879
podcast? I mean, our artwork is done.

1842
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:06,639
Everything's done." And I said, "Or do I

1843
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,720
really want to talk about the pain and

1844
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,400
grit of what we went through as an

1845
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,798
industry and business owners and

1846
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,400
collapse?" I'm like, I'm all, man, I'm

1847
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:16,159
looking at myself. I'm all built for

1848
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,079
this [ __ ] [ __ ] obviously. And then

1849
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:20,719
that's a coin built for this podcast

1850
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,960
came up and I started hammering on that.

1851
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:26,399
And you know that's what the subject

1852
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,480
line is about is really how did we get

1853
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,720
in any business for that matter cannabis

1854
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,039
or not you know there's you know there's

1855
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:35,439
the biggest people in the world have

1856
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,520
failed number of times but nobody wants

1857
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,280
to talk about how they got through those

1858
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:41,519
lowest points you know I mean like I

1859
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,039
said I I'm a suicide survivor the only

1860
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,199
reason I pulled the [ __ ] trigger is

1861
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,280
cuz I had to watch I had seen a mental

1862
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,919
shot of my kids right so I went through

1863
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,440
some some deep dark [ __ ] and what

1864
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,318
happened is I was able to to uh get the

1865
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,880
[ __ ] out, find myself, and build myself

1866
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,558
back. And today, you know, I'm I'm

1867
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,119
building companies back. I'm coming back

1868
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:07,200
from nothing. And, you know,

1869
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:09,599
spiritually, [ __ ] mentally,

1870
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:12,558
physically, I am the best person I've

1871
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:14,000
ever been in my life. So, you recently

1872
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,599
lost a bunch. I've lost weight this

1873
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,358
year. And you recently lost a bunch of

1874
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,880
weight, too. I see your videos. I see

1875
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,558
your boxing. You're doing some good

1876
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,240
stuff. Yeah, it's hot down there, too.

1877
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,319
So, it's it's it's harder to keep the

1878
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,000
weight on down in Arizona, I'm sure.

1879
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:27,920
But, yeah. How did you do it? It's

1880
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,920
partially it's a mental thing. Like, if

1881
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,240
anybody asks me, it's it's mental. It's

1882
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,680
also diet, but a lot of it is mental.

1883
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,759
Like, you got to get over these mental

1884
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:38,639
hurdles. I mean, that's what it is. So,

1885
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,280
I had to restart my entire life, right?

1886
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,440
I I'm getting beat up from every angle.

1887
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,960
Sam, my partner as well, was getting

1888
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,400
beat up from every angle during this

1889
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,798
time. We had each other in business

1890
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,119
back. And I had Amy in my life who was

1891
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:53,440
really inspiring me to show up at the

1892
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,119
gym and watch her. She's a personal

1893
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,760
trainer and a coach. Yeah, that's

1894
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:01,680
awesome. And so, and when I was younger,

1895
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:04,880
I used to box and and

1896
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:07,598
you know, watching my son is, you know,

1897
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,680
soil king Jr. He's 67 and he was

1898
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,200
wrestling through high school. And so I

1899
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:13,279
started jumping on the match with them

1900
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,439
and wrestling during, you know, practice

1901
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,640
with all these kids. And I really found

1902
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,719
something. I I liked it. So I uh I ended

1903
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,039
up buying a gym and myself, all the

1904
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:24,039
stuff and and Amy and I started, you

1905
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:26,640
know, working

1906
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:28,560
out and then I went into the gym and I

1907
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,359
all of a sudden I started feeling good

1908
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,920
about who I was becoming and I could

1909
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,520
start my day off with I do my I do a

1910
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,520
gratitude list. This is how I start my

1911
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,319
day off. I do a gratitude list and the

1912
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,159
second set is is you know my wants. Like

1913
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,839
ask God for what you want, man. It's

1914
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,519
like this is what I want manifesting

1915
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:47,278
this stuff. this is what I want. You

1916
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,679
know, every day I write down what my

1917
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,199
wants are. And then the third part is my

1918
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,399
give. You know, what am I going to give?

1919
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,399
Well, I'm going to be a good person

1920
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,679
today and I'm going to tell some, you

1921
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,719
know, older person, I'm going to let

1922
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,079
bring him into the front of the line.

1923
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,520
I'm going to do good deeds throughout

1924
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:01,600
the day and I'm going to memorize that

1925
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,839
stuff. And then going to the gym and

1926
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,159
working on myself. And by the time I

1927
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:08,640
started working this all this building

1928
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,639
businesses back that was unreal, that

1929
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,400
could never be done. My head was telling

1930
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,759
me, you'll never [ __ ] be the soil

1931
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,519
king. you'll never make it out of this

1932
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,439
hole. You'll never figure this stuff

1933
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,199
out. All of a sudden, I started

1934
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,678
believing in who I was and I was

1935
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:24,318
accomplishing myself before I started

1936
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:27,279
work every day. Yeah. And man, that just

1937
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,960
was like infectious. And then I I was

1938
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,239
jumping on a treadmill. I was doing

1939
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,920
bikes trying to warm up and I'm

1940
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,639
thinking, "This is the dumbest [ __ ]

1941
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,480
ever. I'll never like to go to a gym and

1942
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,159
jump on a treadmill. It just makes no

1943
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,879
sense."

1944
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:43,039
One day I go, that's a struggle for me.

1945
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,798
It's a struggle, man. So then one day I

1946
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,479
decided I'm sitting and there's this

1947
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:49,439
empty there's a couple bags in this big

1948
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,879
gym in Arizona nobody's ever hitting and

1949
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,759
I walked over to it and I started

1950
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,239
hitting it and I'm like oh my god this

1951
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,800
is what I needed. And so you know four

1952
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,919
or five days a week you know I'm doing

1953
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,920
I'm doing six to eight two minute rounds

1954
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,840
with 20 minutes in between just as

1955
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,800
warming up before I go you know hit the

1956
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,800
pile and start doing some stuff. And I'm

1957
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,279
a whole different person. And I [ __ ]

1958
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,800
love myself today. I am the don't have

1959
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,679
the money, right? Don't have the

1960
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:21,760
properties I used to, you know. I am but

1961
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:24,319
I am 100% the best person at 56 I've

1962
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,760
ever been in my life. I love myself more

1963
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:29,960
than I ever have. Right. I'm going

1964
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:32,480
places, right? And so all that

1965
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,880
wreckage and that empire that, you know,

1966
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:37,279
I retired at 52 and the empire imploded

1967
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,920
and I never worked so hard in my life.

1968
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,439
All that stuff that happened, I trade it

1969
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,279
all right now for sitting here telling

1970
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:45,839
you this story about how I love myself

1971
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:48,238
today just for that. Like there's power

1972
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,840
in that, man. There is. There's a lot of

1973
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:51,359
power in that. Yeah. And then having a

1974
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,800
partner that drives you to go to the

1975
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:54,559
gym. We get to, you know, I get up in

1976
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,480
the morning, we smoke some weed. Yeah.

1977
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,239
If I don't smoke weed before the gym,

1978
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,479
I'm thinking I'm hitting the bag. Bam.

1979
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,479
Bam. I'm going at it and I'm I'm

1980
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:03,599
calibrating my day and what I got to get

1981
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:05,439
done. Well, that's the beauty of

1982
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,520
cannabis. And so for me, it's more

1983
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:09,439
extract. I'll I'll hit I'll take dab.

1984
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,440
I'll take a dab. I take a small dab

1985
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:13,279
before I go cuz when I do the if I do

1986
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:15,919
flower, I feel like I'm more winded a

1987
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:17,599
little bit. The dab opens my lungs up.

1988
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,239
So, I'll do I'll do a nice I do rosin

1989
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,400
pens. Yeah. Yeah. I do rosin pens in the

1990
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:24,559
in the morning. I love the invention of

1991
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,238
rosin pens. I mean, regular pens,

1992
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,000
whatever. Uh, you know, and I'm not

1993
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,399
hating on any other type of extract, but

1994
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,238
rosin pens do it for me. I love, you

1995
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:34,079
know, Rosentech. You know, Sam, they got

1996
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:36,479
a great product. Yeah. But yeah, there's

1997
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:38,319
something special about Rossin carts. Um

1998
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:39,439
I I like the half grammers myself. It

1999
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:40,880
was up to me. They'd all be half

2000
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:42,879
grammers. I feel like the best flavors

2001
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,079
in that first half a gram. Yeah. They

2002
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,480
just didn't I mean it's too much

2003
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,000
hardware for a half a gram. In this

2004
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:49,599
industry, if you make a half a gram,

2005
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,119
you're selling it. They want a gram. And

2006
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,400
if you make a gram, they're asking you,

2007
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:55,920
why aren't you going back to the half a

2008
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,279
gram? Just I want the two gram.

2009
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,719
So like for me, it's like those two

2010
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,119
grams don't make any sense cuz I'm like,

2011
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,319
I want the first half of of the gram and

2012
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:04,000
the other gram and a half. If I don't

2013
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:06,960
want, someone else could have the pen.

2014
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,640
So, so it makes zero sense, but I think

2015
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,800
for flavor, I think the the first the

2016
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,960
first half of the gram hits better and

2017
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,880
tastes better. Yeah, agreed. Yeah. So,

2018
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,000
that's and so for me, it's like when I

2019
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,239
get in that mode, I can focus on skill.

2020
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,158
I can focus on footwork and I can look

2021
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:25,519
at the bag and I can get everything I

2022
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:28,000
possibly can out of without worrying

2023
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,080
about work. Flow. Because flow. Yeah.

2024
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,238
Flow. And that's with with smoking the

2025
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:34,000
rosin pin before I get into the gym. And

2026
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:37,119
and so I don't smoke weed throughout the

2027
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,439
day. Yeah. Until after 4:00, 5:00, you

2028
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,599
know, I'm smoking. Then I smoke a joint.

2029
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,839
Yeah. I train over at UFC. CJ comes over

2030
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,760
there. We train sometimes. And Juan from

2031
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,760
Backpack Boys comes in wreaking of

2032
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,840
joints, man. He He lights the whole

2033
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,000
place up with smell. He's got He's got

2034
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,319
turpps on fire. Like I wish I would I

2035
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,238
wish I was with you guys out here, man.

2036
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,158
U But yeah, I'm more of a I'm more of an

2037
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,238
extract guy. I just feel like it makes

2038
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:02,559
it's more clear. It also gives me that

2039
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:03,919
flow and I'm not as winded. Yeah. But uh

2040
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,000
but yeah, I love it. I love it. Yeah.

2041
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,920
OCPD or whatever that is. That's all

2042
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,760
settling in. I don't do I don't you know

2043
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,600
I don't I don't really do dabs. I only

2044
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,239
way I did dabs is when we were doing

2045
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,079
like we were in the facility and we're

2046
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:18,000
mixing flavors, right? So we're trying

2047
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,800
to come up and I take little hits. But

2048
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,560
I've never been a big dabber. But at the

2049
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,719
rosin pin, I got one in my pot. That's

2050
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,080
what I smoke all day long. and not all

2051
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,279
day long, but you know, that's what I

2052
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:31,039
that's my go to that. I love cool dabs

2053
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:32,960
joints. So, I don't like the hot dabs.

2054
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:35,039
I'm not a big hot dab guy, but I like my

2055
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,640
nice cool dabs that have great flavor

2056
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,079
and then it just coats your teeth so you

2057
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,199
get that flavor for the next half hour.

2058
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:42,399
I I love that. Yeah, you taste that tang

2059
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,399
on the back of your throat. That's what

2060
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:46,319
I That's why I judge good weed in a

2061
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:48,158
doobie. Y like if you ever see me

2062
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,719
smoking the second half of a joint, you

2063
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:53,198
know I found something I like. Period. I

2064
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:54,960
I can't smoke I can't smoke weed that

2065
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,960
doesn't taste good. And you can find

2066
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,000
that White Thorn Rose or you can find

2067
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:02,079
those out there that Johnny has and all

2068
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,679
of a sudden I'm I'm down to the roach.

2069
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,600
And when it's down to the roach, I'm

2070
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,199
going back like I need more. I need

2071
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,840
more. I need more. I love that White

2072
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,119
Thorn. So, I have a ZDP. I don't think I

2073
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,800
have any flour here today, but I'll have

2074
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,760
to get you some. You know, it's special.

2075
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,679
It's the Skittles GDP. It's got some

2076
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,199
other stuff in it, too. But it's really

2077
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,279
unique. But if you like white thorn

2078
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,960
Skittles GDP Yeah. And it's candy.

2079
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:25,519
Interesting. And the thing is is all the

2080
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,279
other phenos that we popped. They didn't

2081
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,199
have it. They didn't have it. They

2082
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:30,800
weren't They had shitty structure. They

2083
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,799
didn't taste quite right. And this was

2084
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,640
like the perfect balance where it's GDP

2085
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,640
dominant with a little bit of Skittles.

2086
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,480
Structure is not great, but it doesn't

2087
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,679
matter cuz like for extract and other

2088
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:41,519
things, I feel like if you like White

2089
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,119
Thorn Rose, it's right up your alley. In

2090
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,400
fact, I'm gifting it to Johnny. I'm

2091
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:45,760
going up there next week to gift him

2092
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,759
cuts of it and he's the only one that's

2093
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,840
getting it besides my cultivation

2094
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,640
partner here. He is the only one that's

2095
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,239
getting it in the whole world. That's

2096
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,560
awesome. So, you know, it's it's it's

2097
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,319
special. Okay, that's great. That's

2098
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,560
super exciting. So, yeah. And I like

2099
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:01,198
Skittles. I like GDP. I like Turpps, but

2100
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,360
I also like Chem Dog. I like Northern

2101
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:05,839
Lights. I like funky stuff. I like

2102
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,679
Hazes. I'm so tired of hazes. Once in a

2103
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,760
while, I get original Haze. That's okay.

2104
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,920
But I'm I have hazed out. It's coming

2105
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,800
back though. Coming back. Yeah, they

2106
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:17,359
came down from the hills in December and

2107
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,719
man it was coming back and I people from

2108
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:21,119
Europe are like what the [ __ ] is going

2109
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:23,279
on here? Like confused. Arian from from

2110
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,960
Greenhouse was like what what's going

2111
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:26,399
on? Like I'd never seen anything like

2112
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,800
that either, just to be honest that

2113
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:32,000
there was so many hazes in one place

2114
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:34,560
that were very tinylene dominant. Yeah.

2115
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And uh yeah, it it was wild. But I feel

2116
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,199
like we need to get away from the

2117
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,520
gelatoes. There's nothing wrong with

2118
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:42,079
gelatoes. GMOs, too. But I mean they're

2119
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,679
good producers in good countries game.

2120
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,960
We need to go away from the GMO, right?

2121
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,960
And I think there's so many other things

2122
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,480
to explore. And yeah, it yields and

2123
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,079
yeah, the yield is great, but let's go

2124
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,238
for stuff that doesn't necessarily yield

2125
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,679
or find stuff that yields that produces

2126
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:55,759
the quality that you're looking for. You

2127
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,600
got Brad from Cowboys California Seed

2128
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,920
Bank just crushing it on the on the

2129
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,920
burgers, right? We did in Rosentech. I

2130
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,840
do love Donnie burger though. Even

2131
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,158
though it's a GMO cross, I feel like

2132
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,480
it's special. I mean, it's built for bag

2133
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:11,279
appeal and it just ended when he when he

2134
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:13,279
when he when he, you know, built that

2135
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:15,119
genetic line. I remember Eddie was here

2136
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:18,639
and it was me, him, you know, Eddie, we

2137
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:20,238
had Brett's and I were the adopted had

2138
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,640
paperwork before Eddie passed away,

2139
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:25,359
signed up, kind of keep his heritage and

2140
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,119
legacy alive. And so Brett and I

2141
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,198
remember they were coming up with a the

2142
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,039
burger name and I laughed at the burger

2143
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:32,639
name. I thought it was the dumbest name

2144
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:34,238
ever that you could do. But now you look

2145
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,159
at it and it's burger this, burger that.

2146
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:38,799
But we were at we were at the facility

2147
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:41,679
looking at returns on, you know, in

2148
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,320
Rosentech and it was the the one that

2149
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:46,800
hit the highest was 7.24% and that was a

2150
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:49,679
Donnie burger and it's insane. Yeah. And

2151
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:52,079
and now Brett has uh he has his new

2152
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:55,760
ones. He's hitting over nine and over

2153
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:59,840
11. Wow. It's crazy. Imagine just

2154
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:01,760
imagine that washing that rosin that's

2155
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,600
coming back. That's a rosin return.

2156
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,920
That's rosin return. Yeah. That's not

2157
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,560
that's not hydrocarbon. That's rosin

2158
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,199
returns. Man, when those uh genetics

2159
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,840
were built, they were built for girth,

2160
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:16,158
yield, bag appeal, and handling, you

2161
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,560
know, outside weather. So, Donnie Burger

2162
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,158
myself, I do not like the flower. I love

2163
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,920
it when it converted. No. So, the first

2164
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:23,759
time I saw it, I I've tried the organic,

2165
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,760
but Flor and Flame had some flour. They

2166
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,679
they gifted me and I was like, eh, I

2167
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,440
don't know about this Donnie burger. But

2168
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,800
then he gave me the rosin and I'm like I

2169
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:34,639
I went to Rean on the river this year

2170
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,360
with it. I was sharing it with everybody

2171
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,440
and uh it it's it's really good. It's

2172
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,679
got good flavor. It's got a good effect.

2173
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:43,279
Yeah. U you know I mean the weed put you

2174
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,520
in the [ __ ] couch. There's no doubt

2175
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:48,319
about it. Just lays me out. I can't keep

2176
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,239
smoking it. Yeah, for sure. It's not one

2177
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:52,399
of those ones, you know, I'd hit once in

2178
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:54,799
a while, but I mean that isn't a that

2179
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:56,879
isn't my daily. There's no way. Going

2180
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,719
back to the White Thorn Rose. It's

2181
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,640
feelgood weed. Yeah, it's feel I

2182
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:03,119
remember I brought I brought Johnny up

2183
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,039
to the Gonier campus. Yeah. For the

2184
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:07,439
first time, right, with bags of weed and

2185
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,679
I had it was like our third class coming

2186
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:11,519
through and so we put it all out there

2187
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:15,359
and we did our, you know, our approach

2188
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:17,280
on on White Thorn Rose. It blew

2189
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:20,238
everybody away. It was like, it was

2190
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,920
crazy. And it was Yeah, it was awesome

2191
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,919
to see that. But then that's where it

2192
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,319
was like I I touched in with Johnny

2193
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,840
before that. Yeah. A few years on it and

2194
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:31,599
I was like super impressed with it. It's

2195
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,800
just crazy man. So it's just crazy how

2196
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:37,679
we we evolve and being part of the you

2197
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,960
know the original member uh of the

2198
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,319
ganier was the way we built that thing

2199
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,319
that was that was yeah it's pretty

2200
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:45,840
impressive. I feel like you know the

2201
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,439
there was Oakster Dam and then you guys

2202
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,679
have your own thing with tasting and

2203
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:52,079
Gonier is about flavor pairings and

2204
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,840
understanding profiles. Totally. Yeah.

2205
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:56,158
About really understanding the layers,

2206
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:58,079
right? Layers are super important. like

2207
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:59,439
you when you when we're working about

2208
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:00,880
when we're talking about Appalachians

2209
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:03,198
all around the world and wine and food

2210
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,760
and different things,

2211
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:07,359
you know, you can actually taste when

2212
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,440
you study it and you taste it and you

2213
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:13,519
really have to identify this from the

2214
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:15,519
smell to the dry hit to the light to how

2215
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,360
how it tingles on the back. Like I can

2216
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,440
tell when weeds grown in, you know, if

2217
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:22,238
it's grown in Northern California just

2218
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:24,158
because of the soil mushroom layer that

2219
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:26,158
comes with it versus if it's grown

2220
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:28,719
somewhere else. So you can kind of these

2221
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,238
identifiers are are super cool. Like you

2222
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:32,719
can tell if they're seagull [ __ ] or bat

2223
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,799
[ __ ] Yeah. I mean I mean no doubt about

2224
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,079
it. Especially if you're from up north

2225
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,000
it's like you can tell the guys that

2226
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:40,238
used the seagull. Yeah. Versus the

2227
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,319
banana. Yeah. And uh the seagull

2228
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:44,399
actually worked better when cultivating.

2229
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,559
Yeah. Actually it actually when Seabroo

2230
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:49,119
Seagull came out it was like oh this

2231
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,159
stuff's pretty cool. Yeah. It's amazing.

2232
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,640
Yeah. I work for a company called

2233
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:54,319
American Culinary Chefs Best. Yeah, we

2234
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,239
work with like Yo Play and other things

2235
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:58,799
and I worked on tasting panels. This was

2236
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:01,039
20 years ago almost and we would get

2237
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,159
Doritos chips or Fritos or whatever and

2238
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:03,679
then compare them to all the other

2239
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:05,039
things that are similar to them. We'd

2240
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,960
have to break down the flavors and they

2241
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:08,960
would try to trick us with stuff and we

2242
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,800
did we did these panels and uh basically

2243
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,520
they would certify products as American

2244
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,279
Culinary Chef's best with stars that

2245
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,440
they could put like a little emblem that

2246
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:18,800
they got to put on like Yelp Play. That

2247
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:20,799
was the big one that you always saw in

2248
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,320
the grocery store. But yeah, I learned a

2249
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,840
lot about taste being a chef and it's

2250
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,399
like there's so many different layers

2251
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,279
and it's also subjective. Totally

2252
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,639
subjective. Subjective to the

2253
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:32,238
individual. You have stuff. We're all

2254
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,159
individuals. Yeah. And and you have

2255
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:37,198
memories from childhood that can spawn

2256
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:38,719
something rhubarb pie for me. Rhubarb. I

2257
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,039
remember rhubarb from when I was a

2258
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,640
little kid. And I love rhubarb. Where's

2259
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,238
that strain? That's a good one. We need

2260
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,920
to come up with a rhubarb. I think

2261
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:47,919
somebody has a rhubarb, but I I smelled

2262
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,119
it and it wasn't very rhubarb like and I

2263
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,560
was like, "Okay, somebody was just

2264
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,640
trying to and maybe that's the thing

2265
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:55,039
with phenotypes is it could be an

2266
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:57,119
expression that laid was laid on by

2267
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:59,198
either the nutrition or the environment,

2268
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,880
right? So like phenotypical variation

2269
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:02,158
can change. So when somebody grows it

2270
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,239
because it's called rhubarb and maybe

2271
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,000
the first time they grew it, it was very

2272
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:07,519
rhubarb. Next guy gets it and it's more

2273
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,800
raspberry." Yeah. I haven't tried I

2274
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,480
haven't seen a rhubarb. That'd be

2275
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,520
interesting. You need some rhubarb. You

2276
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:15,599
need some rhubarb. Green tea, rhubarb.

2277
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:18,000
Sweet tea. Green tea. Green tea. Yeah,

2278
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,440
green tea or sweet tea. I mean, I think

2279
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,198
that's the beauty of this plant is

2280
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,759
there's so many directions we can go and

2281
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:25,759
you will find rhubarb. You will find

2282
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,679
green tea. You will find sweet tea. It's

2283
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,760
out there. You just need to Yeah. Start

2284
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:32,399
looking for it. Yeah. Totally. And start

2285
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:35,920
with the right genetics. Yeah. Yeah. I

2286
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:37,679
was when we built when we you know I'm

2287
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,600
the one of the I'm one of the original

2288
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:42,239
council members for the Gonier and and

2289
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,960
just the the history and being part of

2290
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:47,519
that whole process of us you know we had

2291
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,760
Oaksteram and then we had we had we were

2292
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,719
coming out with our program and so we

2293
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:55,199
had Frenchie Canoli right Swami like

2294
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,039
Nick was in there we had uh there's so

2295
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:59,919
many there was like originally it was 12

2296
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:02,880
then it went up to I think to 18 wow but

2297
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:06,359
we'd go to an Airbnb in Marin in big

2298
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,279
house and we'd stay there and it was the

2299
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:12,399
most craziest time because we'd all come

2300
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:15,679
together and and we'd argue between I

2301
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:17,559
remember Frenchie and and Nicotia at the

2302
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:21,039
time and you

2303
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:23,039
know nobody can call it hash. Hash is

2304
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:25,439
ancient. You can't use that. You can't

2305
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:27,600
use ice water hash. Frenchie was

2306
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:30,638
throwing a fit. He was going to quit the

2307
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:33,120
program if you call it icewater hash. We

2308
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,279
own hash, right? Hash is history. I'm

2309
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:37,439
teaching the history of of cannabis.

2310
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:39,039
Well, I'm teaching the history of hash.

2311
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:40,638
You can call it sift. You can call it

2312
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,079
whatever the [ __ ] you want, but you're

2313
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,239
not calling it hash. I remember these

2314
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:46,079
arguments we would have, right? And you

2315
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:49,279
know, and what we ended up having to do

2316
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:52,000
is we have because we all had our

2317
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:54,639
individual personas of ourselves, right,

2318
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,960
of public figure status. Sure. And so

2319
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,639
we're all head tight and not really.

2320
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,600
we've been running and you know kind of

2321
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:03,199
creating our own way bulldozing our way

2322
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,560
through it but in this whole thing we

2323
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:06,879
really had to come down and really

2324
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,639
listen to one another. So once I stepped

2325
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,279
back and started really listening I was

2326
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:12,880
being educated and we all did that and

2327
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:15,198
we all came together and then we built

2328
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,359
this program called the Ganier program.

2329
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,319
It was all that entire time we were

2330
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:22,719
building it. It was uh you know it was

2331
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,799
uh whiteboards and and PowerPoint

2332
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,800
presentations and video cameras and

2333
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,199
producers and everything. Filmed the

2334
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,760
whole thing at oneoff and it was really

2335
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:34,399
an exciting time in my life to be a part

2336
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,639
of that. It really was, man.

2337
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:39,439
Yeahingiting. You guys have a a special

2338
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:41,440
program. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

2339
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,599
But education is so important these days

2340
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,919
on so many levels and there's there's a

2341
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,560
lot of miseducation that's available

2342
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,840
online. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's it's

2343
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,280
hard to know what's right, what's wrong,

2344
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:54,719
and you know, I think we learned from

2345
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:56,000
elders growing up. It was always elders

2346
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,760
like somebody that taught us. And and

2347
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,679
it's not available to everybody that's

2348
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,320
passionate about this plant. And so

2349
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,760
having programs like Oaksterdam and and

2350
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:05,119
Clover Leaf and all these things for

2351
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,520
people that are interested, especially

2352
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:10,079
to break into learning more about if

2353
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,440
they can afford it. Yeah. You know, and

2354
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,039
there is information, there's podcasts,

2355
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:14,638
we talk about stuff, but it's like you

2356
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,158
can you you can really dive deep when

2357
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,440
you go into these classes. Yeah.

2358
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:19,439
Totally.

2359
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:21,238
We got Yeah, there's I've been working

2360
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:24,399
on another project called

2361
01:24:21,238 --> 01:24:26,479
Canender. Um I got a whole AI protocol

2362
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:28,158
and some cool stuff that I'm releasing.

2363
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:29,599
I got a couple different AI tool

2364
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:31,839
protocols that are out there right now.

2365
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,360
One's called the probiotic farmer. Yeah.

2366
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,319
The other one is Soil King. So, it's

2367
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,920
just a whole Q&amp;A and it goes down to,

2368
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:42,000
you know, the probiotic farmer was

2369
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:45,520
really good. We took um Alan Atinson and

2370
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,760
um Tim McCormack from Culture Biologic,

2371
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,520
you know, back then he's now uh you

2372
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,239
know, probiotic farmer is our business

2373
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:54,400
we started. And so we took with Allen,

2374
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:57,279
we took all of the curriculum, if you

2375
01:24:54,399 --> 01:25:00,079
remember the Facebook PFA. Yeah. So the

2376
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:01,679
PFA was like 13 years worth of dialogue,

2377
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:03,760
research books, you know, teaming with

2378
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,239
microbes, all the all the literature

2379
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,000
from 30,000 members across the world

2380
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:09,759
that put into this thing, all the

2381
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,399
research. We were able to take all that

2382
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,639
research and upload it into our AI. Wow.

2383
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,879
So our AI directed it into it. And then

2384
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:20,239
we taught the AI not to do fallacies to

2385
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,880
check for, you know, for false uh

2386
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:24,399
identifiers. And and now the probiotic

2387
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,159
farmer is really like we're getting

2388
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:27,519
ready to just right now getting ready to

2389
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:30,719
launch that. It's going to be app on

2390
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:33,040
your phone and it talks everything, you

2391
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,039
know, Korean natural farming, uh, you

2392
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:36,880
know, all of it. All of it that goes

2393
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:39,198
into it, the research. So, it's super

2394
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,440
cool because, you know, you can you can

2395
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:43,198
ask it anything and it'll give you like

2396
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:46,079
how to make your own bokashi. It'll give

2397
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:47,759
you all the research on I do I do I dive

2398
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,800
into minerals, right? I dive into

2399
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,480
minerals on it and how minerals can

2400
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,920
convert flavors, right? You ask it these

2401
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:55,839
questions and it comes up with all these

2402
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,520
different types of minerals that can

2403
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,360
take the job to where you need it to go.

2404
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,560
Like it's a [ __ ] tool, man. It's

2405
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:02,639
amazing some of this stuff that's coming

2406
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,880
out. We should do a We should do a James

2407
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,800
Loud Seed one. I can I'm ready. I'll

2408
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,239
talk to

2409
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,840
you. I'm doing a course with Oaksterdam.

2410
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:11,638
We're going to have a a course that

2411
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,840
we're doing, a certificate course for

2412
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:15,440
breeding. Um, so that should be a lot of

2413
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,360
fun. But yeah, I'm down. I'll talk I'll

2414
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:19,279
talk to I'll hook you up with our guy.

2415
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:22,000
He's working at NASA building stuff for

2416
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:24,559
AI right now. But he can take all your

2417
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,840
book right now and he can, you know, put

2418
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,000
everything in your book and all the

2419
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,239
curriculum that you want in addition to

2420
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,639
what AI will find on its own and do its

2421
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,879
own research. The key with AI, you have

2422
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,800
to direct it. Meaning, you don't want it

2423
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,400
to wander in areas like for me on the

2424
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,800
soil kingdom one. I'm not trying to go

2425
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,638
towards synthetic farming, right? So I

2426
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,400
I, you know, put blockers in there so

2427
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,920
it's not identifying that direction.

2428
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,599
It's staying on this side of the path

2429
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,679
that I believe in. Nice. On the

2430
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:54,079
organics. Yeah. So we'll we'll

2431
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:55,840
definitely Yeah. I'm so cool. Yeah.

2432
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:58,800
Yeah. So if you had one piece of advice

2433
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,960
for your younger self Yeah. I don't know

2434
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,719
how much younger. Let's go like 14.

2435
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,520
Yeah. What would that one piece of

2436
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:07,119
advice be? Man, I love myself today. And

2437
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,159
I talk about, you know, part of my story

2438
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:13,198
is the 13-year-old boy within. At 13

2439
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,839
years old, I went home and uh I looked

2440
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,919
in the door, looked in the windows, the

2441
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,039
house was moved out, and my mom decided

2442
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,880
to move out and leave me. So, I was

2443
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:24,719
homeless. And because of Niles Canyon,

2444
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,359
and because of growing weed, I was able

2445
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:29,840
to support myself. I lived and I was

2446
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:32,799
homeless trying to get myself to uh

2447
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:35,279
Mission High, Mission, you know, Hopkins

2448
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,880
Junior High, washing my hair in a creek,

2449
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:38,639
and I realized just school wasn't for

2450
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,119
me. So, we talk about this 13-year-old

2451
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:43,440
boy within. I embrace him and it's the

2452
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:46,238
best part of my life. I'm built by the

2453
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:49,039
story. I ended up I ended up buying my

2454
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,638
first house at 19 and starting my first

2455
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:52,399
plumbing company at 18. And that's

2456
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:54,079
because I didn't go to high school,

2457
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:56,158
right? It's because I went straight to

2458
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:58,238
work and I grew weed on the side as a

2459
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,000
side hustle and I made side hustle money

2460
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:02,479
going to the only reason I went to the

2461
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,238
high school was to sell dubbies. Yeah.

2462
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:07,359
Right. And I and I did really good at

2463
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:10,279
that, you know. So the advice for myself

2464
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:13,359
would say would be stay solid to who you

2465
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:15,920
are, you know. And with with who I am

2466
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,599
today, you know, I found I found a a

2467
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:20,079
power greater in myself. I choose to

2468
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,560
call God. And I would say that that

2469
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,880
would be just to tap into into faith

2470
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:27,440
over fear and anxiety, right? To go back

2471
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,960
into that. Just keep driving that [ __ ]

2472
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:31,119
happens and your life's going to be

2473
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,600
great. Quit worrying about it. Yeah. The

2474
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:35,840
one thing constant is change. And I feel

2475
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,280
like when times are good, they're good.

2476
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,119
And they're going to be bad, but they're

2477
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:41,039
also going to be good again. The bad

2478
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,760
times build the great times. That's how

2479
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:45,600
it is. Never appreciate the good times

2480
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,600
if you don't have the bad times. Like

2481
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,280
literally, if you've never had bad

2482
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,120
times, you're you don't know how good it

2483
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:54,559
is when it's good, you know? And I'm the

2484
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:57,279
best for myself right here, right now

2485
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,600
because of the bad times. Yeah. Right.

2486
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:01,599
And I didn't quit. Yeah. The bad times

2487
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,840
make you who you are and they, you know,

2488
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:06,400
how you deal with things in those bad

2489
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,480
times defines you as a person. Yeah. So,

2490
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:10,799
yeah. Well, uh, if people are looking to

2491
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:12,559
find out more about Pat King, Yeah.

2492
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,639
where can they go? I mean, you just

2493
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,320
Google the soil king. Yeah, there's so

2494
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:18,079
much stuff that I'm and I'm doing, you

2495
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:20,319
know, I'm building out licenses in New

2496
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:23,198
York. I I teach uh, you know,

2497
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:25,119
regenerative agriculture on on uh on

2498
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:27,678
agriculture scale, food scale, as well

2499
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:30,079
as cannabis. And, you know, we're I have

2500
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:32,000
some of the best farmers. I consult uh

2501
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:34,238
for the some of the best cannabis farms

2502
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,238
all across the country here on living

2503
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:38,238
soil, indoor, greenhouse, and outdoor.

2504
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,638
And we're just crushing it at every

2505
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:43,359
level of success. You know, I'm known as

2506
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:45,359
the sourcing guy that I check. I've

2507
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:47,439
always been the one that's sourced clean

2508
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:49,039
products. I test for heavy metals. I

2509
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:51,839
when I build soils or inputs or

2510
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:54,719
fertilizers, biologics, everything I do,

2511
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,400
I pre-source before I build. And I'm

2512
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,079
part of a successful tool in the

2513
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:59,920
licensed market. Now, there's a lot of

2514
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:03,760
failures. The hardest thing in this

2515
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:06,480
industry is watching a lot of money go

2516
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,920
into converting into living soil. Yeah.

2517
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:09,919
And then and then at the end of the

2518
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,560
year, they fail for heavy metal. They

2519
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,319
fail for something. And that is just

2520
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,719
because they trust the wrong partners,

2521
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,719
right? To to get to there. With my

2522
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,239
cultivators and my farmers, they aren't

2523
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,158
experiencing that. We're going three

2524
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:23,839
years in license without any fails.

2525
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:25,920
Yeah. You know, and it's super important

2526
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,079
to be part of that team. And the hardest

2527
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,158
thing is to watch that same farm that

2528
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:31,679
goes to living and fails convert back to

2529
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:33,439
synthetics because it's easier and

2530
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:35,840
there's dollars to be made. It didn't

2531
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:38,000
have to be like that. It had to be like

2532
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,239
that. Consulting, you know, hit me up.

2533
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,039
Organic King Consulting is still here.

2534

the show today. Thank you so much. I

2540
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,480
look forward to doing this again. We'll

2541
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,960
uh Yeah, love to do this sometime. Yeah,

2542
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:03,919
this is a great moment for me on here

2543
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,000
because this is James Loud's podcast.

2544
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,920
Like, you know, this isn't somebody that

2545
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,039
came out a year ago with a podcast and

2546
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,880
his zing. guy is an OG in the industry.

2547
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:15,119
You look at his genetics and what he's

2548
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,719
done with the expressions and just

2549
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:18,319
coming into this facility. I mean,

2550
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:20,079
you're a pioneer and you're a leader,

2551
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:22,519
man. For me to sit on the other side of
