00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,198
a

2
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,600
[Music]

3
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,079
how's it going everybody welcome to

4
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,960
another episode of the James Cloud

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,198
podcast and today our special guest is

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,039
Chris frell the author of this book 100

7
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,799
gram per square foot amazing how are you

8
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,198
doing today doing well man doing well

9
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,640
thanks for having me thank you for

10
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,718
coming out uh we met originally at

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,920
Emerald cup earlier this year and you

12
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,239
are also self-published correct uh so

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,118
you and I can uh talk about all the

14
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,640
crazy things that it it means to be

15
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,000
self-published and the the process I

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,519
think there's a lot of stuff we can pass

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,319
on to people that are interested in

18
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,039
publishing but also I wanted to get into

19
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,158
your book and talk about 100 grams per

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,560
square foot let's do it that's pretty

21
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,920
amazing we both have books that came out

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,719
around the right time because I feel

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,399
like there's a need for someone to write

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,158
a book on how to get better yields right

25
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,840
and just like for breeding I feel like

26
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,439
we're way overdue for a breeding book

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
that had a lot of detail on breeding um

28
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,519
that was detailed you know I was excited

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,640
to write a book and then self-publishing

30
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,000
I was like I'm going to do it I thought

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,359
it was going to be a lot easier how you

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,840
feel about it very very similar

33
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,560
experience you know what we thought was

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,600
going to be a year and a half two-year

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,359
project you know quickly unfolded into

36
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,718
three and a half years and then you know

37
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,078
trying to pull things together at the

38
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,640
end and you know we're still trying to

39
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,279
work on marketing for ourselves so it's

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,118
still just a you know it's a long

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,079
process so three and a half years from

42
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:09,318
start to finish correct yeah that's

43
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,639
really good mine was five five years and

44
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,159
I thought I could do it in one because I

45
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,479
had like this big ego in the beginning

46
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,079
I'm like dude I could knock this out in

47
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,679
one and originally I thought it was

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,640
going to be uh 30,000 words and we ended

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
up with

50
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,639
115,000 and I had over 20 people that

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,640
contributed to the books whether it was

52
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:28,159
photographs videos chapter on tissue

53
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,000
culture a chap chapter on uh

54
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,000
intellectual property and

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,598
law uh so it unfolded and turned into

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
this thing that was much bigger than

57
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:41,039
myself uh which I think a lot of times

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,959
books do 100% man yeah same same over

59
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,120
here you know uh what we thought would

60
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
be a short process you know took a lot

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,878
longer especially when you start getting

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,959
other folks involved you start getting

63
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,639
those critiques it makes you think and

64
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,719
you honestly end up learning more

65
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,119
throughout the process yeah I learned so

66
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:58,519
much from start to finish about breeding

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,519
and a lot of things changed uh with

68
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,560
cultivation and L DS and stuff that had

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,280
I not taken five years and put the book

70
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,598
out five years ago would have been

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,199
outdated by the time 20124 rolled around

72
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,479
you know there was so you know with LEDs

73
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,280
and doing reversals and my

74
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,560
experimentations I I did a lot of

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,959
experimenting with LEDs and HPS and you

76
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,039
know I wasn't getting good reversals

77
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,400
with LEDs whereas HPS I got this amazing

78
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,438
reverse like reverse plant that looked

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,239
beautiful right and and dumped out

80
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,560
pollen whereas I get 20% reversals with

81
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,200
LEDs and so the difference is the far

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,840
red right that's one of the differences

83
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,639
the heat the far red there's a couple

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,920
different things but uh HPS for the win

85
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,318
especially for reversals now in this

86
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,079
modern world a lot of us are using LEDs

87
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,798
I use LEDs for uh pheno hunting because

88
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,480
a lot of my customers that buy seeds use

89
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,920
LEDs so what's your take on LED versus

90
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,039
HPS H I think that you can grow a great

91
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,438
flower under both lights honestly I

92
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,239
think there's also something to be said

93
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,479
about having you know more sophisticated

94
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,759
LEDs you know take the company fo for

95
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,639
example they're really taking things to

96
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,120
the next level with the Spectrum tuning

97
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,078
capabilities I mean there's a couple

98
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,200
companies doing it but I work with them

99
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,640
and I work with science so you know it's

100
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,519
like yeah Spectrum tuning is legit like

101
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,319
it's great the potential for spectrum

102
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,639
tuning and the future of spectrum tuning

103
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,120
we're just scratching the surface with

104
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,840
it and it's like there's so much

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
potential for it oh I agree man I agree

106
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,879
completely so and I think some of the

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
stuff is really going to be cultivar

108
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,038
specific which lighting is kind of

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
anyway because you can just look at HPS

110
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:37,439
versus LED and you go Blue Dream HPS all

111
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,918
the way you put it under LED and it gets

112
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,719
a different expression same thing with

113
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,519
like the ogs now I I haven't run that

114
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,960
many ogs but I've heard from a couple

115
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,799
people that are growing the best OG that

116
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,599
I smoked that CMH is actually the best

117
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,520
Spectrum yeah I've had similar

118
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,759
experiences I've got some strains some

119
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,519
cultivars rather that you know they'll

120
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,400
dump uh you know 80 90 grams of square

121
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,758
not finicky at all under HPS before I

122
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,519
made the transition and now putting them

123
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,639
under you know more intense lighting

124
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,399
they just they just don't like it

125
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,439
they're they're super finicky yeah they

126
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,758
just don't take as well Skittles

127
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,120
Skittles I feel like the Skittles that

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,960
my friend grows under LED is way better

129
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,918
than my HPS Skittles that I was growing

130
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:17,359
in 2018 like leagues above it it's also

131
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,439
he just experimented the living soil we

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,919
smoked it a couple podcasts ago we're g

133
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,079
to smoke some today really good stuff

134
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,918
but I feel like it it just and it's like

135
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,279
dialing in the cultivar for the

136
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:32,038
environment yeah different nutrient

137
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:34,239
regimens uh regimens ppfd is comes into

138
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,680
play I think you go into that in your

139
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,199
book quite a bit uh the importance of

140
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,000
ppfd is and basically crop steering

141
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,199
absolutely man yeah there's I mean crop

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,680
steering is everything that's happening

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,360
in the room right from climate to your

144
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,759
fertigation and substrate

145
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,080
management uh literally everything

146
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,759
surrounding the plant is is crop

147
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,079
steering it's not just you know a lot of

148
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,960
people get this confused it's not just

149
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,478
you know what are you doing in the

150
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,399
subrate it's you know how are you

151
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,800
tailoring your VPD right you know your

152
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,198
light levels it all comes into play when

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,560
you're steering something as certain way

154
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,560
in that either high stress environment

155
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,399
or that low stress environment to you

156
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,000
know promote uh ripening flowering fruit

157
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,198
development and then uh vegetative

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,720
growth well and VPD is a tricky one too

159
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,000
because I think a lot of people they

160
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,639
have the troll master and they're like

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,598
well it's in the range of the VPD and

162
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,439
then they're not accounting for surface

163
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,560
temperature of the leaf right and I

164
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,160
think that's the big thing right I mean

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,680
at least I think it is yeah and you know

166
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,960
so there's so many things that are you

167
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,759
know there's a learning curve still

168
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,000
where people are like oh I just used

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,160
this chart and it it's it's all UNC in

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,598
it works and it's like well it'll work

171
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,560
but you're not optimizing the VPD in

172
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,000
those situations for sure yeah there's

173
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,598
definitely no one siiz fits-all and

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,519
having those IR sensors going into the

175
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:43,680
canopy which not a lot of folks use will

176
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:46,598
definitely help you dial that part of

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,240
that process totally yeah it's like the

178
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,199
technolog has just come a long ways in

179
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,879
the last 10 years it's pretty amazing

180
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,840
and then guys like Josh and Ramsay that

181
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,839
have kind of uh moved the needle forward

182
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,198
and you know especially with crop

183
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,598
steering and then books like this coming

184
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,280
out to where the information's

185
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,279
accessible you don't have to just know

186
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,839
the right person now you can buy a book

187
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,359
because I think in the beginning it's

188
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,318
like oh well who do you know that's

189
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,759
going to share their secrets with you

190
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,800
yeah yeah literally I mean that was the

191
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,360
whole uh thought behind the book right

192
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,120
it's like we all since you know starting

193
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,759
getting into what we all do now is it's

194
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,598
always been this search for for good

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,800
information you know because it's 90% of

196
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,478
it's bad right and bringing it all

197
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,120
together in a digestible manner where

198
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:26,639
you can look through it's very textbook

199
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,959
style but wanted to give it coffee table

200
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,038
Vibes too it's it's very easy to go

201
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,359
through and figure out out you know

202
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,918
which one of these Cardinal parameters

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
am I having issues with and then you can

204
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,000
just go through the steps of your

205
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,038
troubleshooting right yeah I've had two

206
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,759
friends steal the book already and I had

207
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,598
to go back and get it from them but uh

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,120
yeah it's a great book I feel like it's

209
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,120
it's easy to digest whereas like some

210
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,319
textbooks are like super complicated and

211
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,918
they go over your head and you have to

212
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,879
keep on going and but you can actually

213
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,519
pick it apart chapter by chapter or you

214
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,158
can go to specific stuff that you're

215
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,560
interested about I feel like I wrote a

216
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,759
book similar in that sense where it's

217
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,158
like there's a lot of Gable information

218
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,240
and there's something for everybody in

219
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,199
there and if you read it you're going to

220
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,519
learn something 100% I actually started

221
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,879
reading your book recently too man I'm

222
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,758
digging it so far you could tell that

223
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,039
there was a ton of work put into it

224
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
thank you yeah yeah yeah we we really

225
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,598
did you know so I wrote the book about

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,360
five times and threw away the first four

227
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,158
versions of it and then the last time

228
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,680
the last draft was kind of a start to

229
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:23,279
finish and I wrote it pretty quickly

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,840
based on the other things and then I

231
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,758
brought an editor in named Angela Baka

232
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,519
she basically picked it apart and was

233
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,000
like no we need to rearrange it this way

234
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,559
I was like well I want to do and she's

235
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,599
like no no I think it would make more

236
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,399
sense if we go from here to here to here

237
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,919
so it's very linear in that sense and

238
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,360
then people can understand it better and

239
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,519
she she had a lot of good points and so

240
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,879
sometimes it takes the outside

241
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,240
perspective looking in to go okay well

242
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,958
this is how you should do it 100% I did

243
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
the same thing I uh I brought in a bunch

244
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,958
of former colleagues uh steuart wiox

245
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,959
former COO of cure Leaf I wanted that

246
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,879
high level

247
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,679
perspective you know does it read well

248
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,360
for for folks that are you know at that

249
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,000
upper Edge Lawn of companies is going to

250
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,079
be you know able to provide value to

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,879
them I brought in some folks uh my

252
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:05,719
buddies at groan John jerich kovic went

253
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,480
through Reddit gave me good feedback

254
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,079
yeah uh Liam Spencer who's actually

255
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,360
working for a science LED for a while I

256
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:12,159
think he's actually a crop specialist

257
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,800
for a Roy and now real good kid I love

258
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,278
him probably five other guys I'm

259
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,120
forgetting right now but yeah that

260
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,519
alternate pers or additional perspective

261
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,320
is what really turned that book into

262
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,480
something great yeah totally yeah I mean

263
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,240
the more people that touch the book The

264
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,839
the bigger it becomes in a lot of ways

265
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,079
and then it just outgrows you and you're

266
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,040
part of something so much bigger than

267
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:33,559
yourself and it's like and these books

268
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,078
you know they have value they could last

269
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,159
a lifetime I feel like there's just so

270
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:39,199
many things but let's talk about yield

271
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,838
for a second because I love the title of

272
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,320
your book but also what is the largest

273
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,079
yield you've gotten largest yield I've

274
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,519
gotten probably around 130 grams a

275
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,958
square which is like five pounds of

276
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,120
light give or take yeah yeah so pushing

277
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,239
that five pound envelope with quality

278
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,879
yeah I believe it's quality man we uh we

279
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,519
use great inputs we've got a great team

280
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,078
we do all our crop work on schedule we

281
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,320
don't you know we don't cut Corners

282
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,599
anywhere throughout our processes and um

283
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,240
I think that goes a long way with the

284
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,120
final product at the end of the day

285
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,159
right totally most recently don't mean

286
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
to interrupt we hit 110 grams uh two

287
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,719
weeks ago that was really exciting

288
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160
anytime we we do something good like

289
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,839
that we always take the team out you

290
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,480
know got to make sure the team's taken

291
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,200
care of because those are the folks

292
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,519
really making it happen and what kind of

293
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,079
scale is this at I'm sure a lot of

294
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,959
people are curious about that so this is

295
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:29,439
right now I'm running, 1500 foot rooms

296
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,759
of canopy wow I've uh you I've run 100

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,040
of thousands of square feet of canopy

298
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,838
working for cure Leaf in different

299
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,679
states right but uh currently I'm

300
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,639
running, 1500 foot rooms nice that's

301
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,958
great just small enough to still kind of

302
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,560
be craft it's not too big to control and

303
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,679
then rockwool is your substrate of

304
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,838
choice uh love rock wool we're running

305
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,039
that in our perum gr right now and uh

306
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,959
seeing great results there but I do like

307
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,480
Coco I love Coco there's a bit more I do

308
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:58,838
too I think cocoa flavor I mean rockwool

309
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,920
probably has the best look I think Coco

310
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,240
probably

311
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,319
is the most dynamic and soil I think has

312
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,560
the best

313
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,360
flavor uh and you can get great flavor

314
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,479
out of rockwool don't get me wrong but

315
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,720
and rockwool is you know Rockwall is

316
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,680
probably the the as far as like being

317
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,440
able to control you can have a lot more

318
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,319
control with rock wall 100% yeah smaller

319
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,240
substrate to manage you can get quicker

320
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,720
responses yeah and feedback and if

321
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,000
you're going I feel like it's a little

322
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,160
bit more accurate too when you're trying

323
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,240
to like uh you know because we do like a

324
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,360
10% dryback overnight and then 3% per

325
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,799
hour and then you know at least that's

326
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,039
what we do here uh and everybody has

327
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,359
their own way of doing it but I feel

328
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,360
like the rock wall you can really die

329
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,639
that in Cocoa it's like it'll it'll vary

330
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,839
from pot to pot a little bit more for

331
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,480
sure yeah a lot more variability which

332
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,440
sometimes requires more sensors but yeah

333
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,879
yeah to get more averages and then once

334
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,560
you have the average you can dial it in

335
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,039
a little bit more exactly you're only as

336
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,439
good as the or your decisions are only

337
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,399
as good as the data sets you have to

338
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,519
make them from so right well how many

339
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,759
sensors do you feel like you should have

340
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,759
uh in a room uh in a room I don't really

341
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,399
go by per room per se but I go about you

342
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,879
know per square foot I'd say about One

343
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,799
sensor per 150 square feet of canopy

344
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:13,720
okay there you go yeah nice and then

345
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,120
what sensors do you think work the best

346
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,199
uh it depends on the substrate right

347
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,159
like you have the gross sense which

348
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,078
obviously probably you know that's what

349
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,639
I use is gross sense I use gross sense

350
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,039
for dryb backs right but then we also

351
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,560
have agretech so we have redundancy so I

352
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,679
use more than one redundancy is key yeah

353
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,919
yeah I like a Royo though I've been

354
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,759
working with them for a couple years now

355
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,439
uh great platform easy to read and

356
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,679
interpret the data to make adjustments

357
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,240
and then you also have the redundancy

358
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,719
builtin with their climate stations and

359
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,560
such so you can compare that to whatever

360
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,680
your uh you know existing building

361
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,000
management system was before you

362
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,159
implemented that into your uh operation

363
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,639
right yeah and actually have a royya

364
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,759
sensors here too we just don't have the

365
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,000
aoya system anymore but like I feel like

366
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,559
I would like to go back because we all

367
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,159
about AB testing so I want to I would

368
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,679
love to compare the data between aoya

369
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,519
and grense because I feel like they're

370
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,838
both good and so you know it's like how

371
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,879
how much off is each one what's the

372
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,920
difference is am I getting better

373
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:07,198
results with one than the other know we

374
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,599
do that with everything from the

375
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:10,799
irrigation skid that I showed you

376
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,199
earlier that's what keeps me excited

377
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,439
every day I come in I'm like okay well

378
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:15,599
it's almost like I can play with this

379
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,040
stuff but it's also data driven and so

380
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,920
I'm trying to do it in a productive uh

381
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,599
scientific way to where we get actual

382
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,519
data that's valuable instead of just

383
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,120
playing around right right so because a

384
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
lot of people they like to play around

385
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,480
yeah thousand ways of skin a cat you

386
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,479
know for sure well with cultivation it's

387
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,440
like harvest date depending on the

388
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
cultivar uh what do you like do you want

389
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,079
more candy do you want more gas do you

390
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,799
want it stronger do you want it more

391
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,078
mild are you using it for extract yeah I

392
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,719
mean all those things come into play and

393
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:45,838
we're planning our rims out so it's for

394
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,160
for us at least it's always a

395
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,800
collaborative effort right like what's

396
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,879
doing well at the retail level that you

397
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,439
know goes back to the lab our production

398
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,799
team our extraction team what do we need

399
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,279
to formulate different products whether

400
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,120
it's aive or as a gummy that we need a

401
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,399
specific flavor profile for so we'll

402
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,720
make sure we have an allocation in the

403
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,039
room for things so we'll send just a

404
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,120
fresh frozen yeah what cartridges are

405
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,599
doing well in terms of live resin pens

406
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,759
same thing there allocations for that

407
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,519
and then you know what finished flower

408
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,759
do we really want what which one of our

409
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
stores right well yeah and you're in the

410
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,720
cultivation space so you're doing the

411
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,879
Lord's work it's a challenge these days

412
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,600
uh I just do the nursery we we don't

413
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,879
have any we don't sell flour or anything

414
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,120
like that but we do feno hunt we do

415
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:28,039
testing uh and the nursery model which I

416
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,000
love uh licensing genetics clones all

417
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,278
that stuff we're about to go direct to

418
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
Consumer with the Clones I can be a

419
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,879
consumer I'd love to get some ear Cuts

420
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
yeah absolutely and I feel like we're

421
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,320
we're looking for people to partner with

422
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,320
in other places so I think that that

423
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,199
could be an interesting conversation

424
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,879
should have an R&amp;D room coming online in

425
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,799
a couple of months up in perum so nice

426
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,240
yeah should do some fun things out there

427
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,479
yeah and I love testing things in

428
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,000
different environments and seeing what

429
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,720
kind of results people get and comparing

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,679
coas but also comparing opinions on

431
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,399
flower you know because I think

432
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,919
different regions and different places

433
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,399
have uh different desires as far as what

434
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,278
kind of end product works like

435
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,679
California the Bay Area La purple candy

436
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:11,439
gas is like really what they want and it

437
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,919
can go more gas it can go more candy it

438
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,360
can go more or less purple but it's

439
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,759
really kind of in that like you might be

440
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,759
able to sell some Sour Diesel or some

441
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,759
blue dream these days it's surprising

442
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,199
blue Dreams made a huge comeback uh and

443
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,278
maybe it never left completely but like

444
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:28,599
now it's it's popular everywhere again

445
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,799
people really love it I think it's

446
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,120
interesting because the effect yeah it

447
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,479
definitely lost some steam and I

448
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,078
remember buddies you know running all

449
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,120
their garages and houses and up up in

450
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:38,198
the pter canyon just blue dream never

451
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
had any problem getting rid of anything

452
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:43,399
for years you know then probably two

453
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,720
2016 2017 came around and then that's

454
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,480
when you guys the readers started really

455
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,920
getting creative with stuff and yeah and

456
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,680
I mean we had it in the early early to

457
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,360
mid 2000s and it that's when it had its

458
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,879
day and then as soon as the Clones got

459
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,519
out the price dropped on it you know it

460
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,159
was like one of the worst years of my

461
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,480
life because I was like so focused on

462
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,919
growing blue dream and then Christmas

463
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,720
came around and I had all these packs it

464
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,240
was a long story but uh once the market

465
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,680
got flooded with it it was so easy to

466
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,519
grow and that was the first thing that

467
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,799
was kind of like oh it was easy to get

468
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,039
over two pounds of light for almost

469
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,359
anybody you know and then now people are

470
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,078
like oh two pounds of light isn't good

471
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,240
enough we need to hit three to be

472
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,799
successful not everybody but like at a

473
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,198
commercial scale I think a lot of people

474
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:25,599
are looking for that three pound of

475
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,240
Light number yeah that that all boils

476
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,920
down to your margins and costing right

477
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,519
like taking that lean approach

478
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,078
eliminating steps and I mean having a

479
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,519
plant that can yield heavier is just

480
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,919
going to bring your cost down across the

481
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,679
board yeah I mean I have some friends

482
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,360
that run double stack in they they have

483
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,318
a wreck road down the street and they

484
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,318
have a double stack and their cost per

485
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,799
pound to produce it is they get over

486
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:51,318
three pounds of light is like $280 per

487
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,879
pound indoor and that you know 600 was

488
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,318
the average for the longest time I think

489
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,120
the average is now probably five maybe

490
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,639
475 or something like that but in wreck

491
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,759
we have high electricity here too it's

492
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,640
super expensive you know we're not like

493
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,038
Washington State at s cents a kilowatt

494
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,880
we're like 39 cents a kilowatt yeah

495
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:12,919
we're at 12 cents a kilowatt up in uh

496
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,640
Vegas areas yeah nice we're also Hing I

497
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,839
think right around dollar per gram after

498
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,559
dry trim cure testing everything yeah

499
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,318
not in the package but no but that's a

500
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,399
good that's a good number to hit I feel

501
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,720
like anybody is getting below that is

502
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,439
doing some Miracles you know to be able

503
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,319
to get those numbers and you know the

504
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,000
double stack plays a huge role and then

505
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,240
cul of our selection is huge everything

506
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,599
boils down to genetics genetics is now

507
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,079
and will forever be the backbone of

508
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,959
every operation you know you're only as

509
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,798
good as your your weakest guy right so

510
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,679
if you have strong genetics you're G to

511
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:47,200
have strong crops Pest and pathogen free

512
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,038
good genetics it's like and it's such a

513
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
big thing now I think uh for the longest

514
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,038
time we really didn't talk we were

515
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,159
worried about spidermites and then it

516
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:58,558
was rude aphids and maybe

517
00:17:54,159 --> 00:18:00,200
some uh broad mites and russet mites uh

518
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,359
but now it's like we got to worry about

519
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,159
pathogens like significant they do

520
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,839
significant damage oh yeah and uh if

521
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,840
you're if you get your blinders on still

522
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,519
you're gonna get burned you're gonna get

523
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,000
you're gonna get hit oh yeah you know if

524
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,440
you're trading Cuts with everybody like

525
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,640
it's no big deal you know that's like

526
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,480
having sex in the 80s without

527
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,880
protection that's right man it's all

528
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
about getting that good quarantine

529
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,080
having them come from reliable stores

530
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,558
going through all the pathogen testing

531
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:27,480
and yeah yeah viroids are a problem like

532
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:28,839
uh you know if you're not managing your

533
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,679
stub straight correctly you know you can

534
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,918
get real bad fum Moxy sporum problems by

535
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,200
just giving him that perfect

536
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,919
oversaturated environment yeah and I

537
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,400
think ferium is a thing we don't talk

538
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,799
about enough because we're so focused on

539
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,480
Hop plate and ver but ferium is a big

540
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,720
problem and it's out there everywhere

541
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,839
that's another one that I'm seeing

542
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,000
everywhere with stuff and a lot of

543
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,199
people will say no that's H plate and

544
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,480
it's like no it's not you could it looks

545
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,759
like feran yeah yeah cut it open totally

546
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,200
exactly so yeah so how did you get your

547
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,079
start in cultivation and everything that

548
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,279
you're doing now yeah so I was I was in

549
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,158
the Marine Corps infantry for five years

550
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,200
and uh I mean prior to that I was a

551
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,080
river guide on the shanado and patomic

552
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,840
rivers and uh just always been real

553
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,119
fascinated by plant medicine you know

554
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,240
mushrooms fungi adaptogenic herbs

555
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,439
cannabis obviously yeah grew a little

556
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,519
bit of weed sold a little bit of weed

557
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,798
back then nothing of scale or anything

558
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,158
of note but uh that that was the initial

559
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,759
thing that kind of perked my interest

560
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,799
and then after getting out of the Marine

561
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,038
Corps moved out to Colorado had some

562
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:26,759
buddies that were running caregiver

563
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,720
operations did a lot of work with them

564
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,440
was real fortunate to learn a lot from

565
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,400
from those guys and uh that was my start

566
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,120
I probably spent about 3 years uh

567
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,038
growing in Colorado up in the pter

568
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,639
canyon Fort Collins native roots and uh

569
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,400
Denver Colorado nice then uh East coat

570
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,320
Market started opening up took a move

571
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,640
East did some Consulting uh rewrote some

572
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,839
curriculums for the Cleveland School of

573
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,360
cannabis for their commercial

574
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,119
cultivation operations course and their

575
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,678
cannabis cultivation course then I got

576
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,639
picked up by cure Leaf helped them

577
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,880
design some facilities start some

578
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,159
facilities uh kind of in a regional

579
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,120
capacity there for about a year and a

580
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,520
half while the first facility in Ohio

581
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,798
was getting built and uh yeah was with

582
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,359
them for about 3 years and then uh

583
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,960
wanted to move back home to Colorado and

584
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,798
then ended up uh being reached out to

585
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,840

been with them now for three years wow

592
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,399
done a lot of good things so when you

593
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,400
were in Fort Collins did you get to try

594
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,240
that Fort Collins cough the Fort Collins

595
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,240
cough where is that coming from Fort

596
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,359
Collins Colorado a specific store

597
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,240
breeder no it was so that's a nl5 haze

598
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,599
cross that's uh extremely special I I

599
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,798
did some breeding with it a couple years

600
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,558
ago and I love it and it's just thing is

601
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,960
is like the outdoor Growers they

602
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,599
struggle with it because it gets so tall

603
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,880
it'll go right over your fence line and

604
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,759
it just keeps getting taller and taller

605
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,720
and taller even even in the end it's

606
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,279
still you know it's still growing

607
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,480
throughout flower and uh but yeah it's

608
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,599
it's it's hazy it's funky it's got a

609
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,319
real strong Funk to it sounds like I

610
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,439
missed out on something yeah yeah that

611
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,079
that's a special one and I feel like I

612
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,480
haven't seen I haven't seen it grown

613
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,918
indoors I've heard about people that

614
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,159
grow in indoors I've seen pictures on

615
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,400
Instagram of it grown indoors but most

616
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,039
of the time I've seen it is outside and

617
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,559
I grew it outside myself nice I was

618
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:21,599
running uh probably three things

619
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,879

never grown it or anything like that but

650
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:41,000
I I really like the cultivar I like the

651
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:43,679
expression I like the effect too oh yeah

652
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,759
great plant structure great yielder and

653
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,038
great great flower yeah yeah Colorado's

654
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,200
got some good stuff I don't think they

655
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,000
get enough credit all the time I don't

656
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,558
either man now they got Adam done in his

657
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
podcast ruining it all for everybody so

658
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,119
yeah he's a good friend of mine but yeah

659
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,159
he's uh he's got some good genetics he's

660
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,839
do did some sage and saour Crosses

661
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
together and that's another one that's

662
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,678
my favorite or one of my favorites sour

663
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,079
is my favorite catus is my favorite

664
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,000
don't really get to see them too often

665
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,879
anymore they catus definitely not sour

666
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,519
I've just reconnected with sour uh the

667
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,400
reg on the river this year so that's

668
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,158
that's one of our local favorite

669
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,240
varieties all right so you have any here

670
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,760
um no but we do have some Skittles you

671
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,880
like Skittles I do like Skittles nice

672
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,158
yeah we got some Skittles and then we

673
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,760
got some crippy uh we're calling this

674
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:38,039
stuff Uncle Rick's crippy and it's like

675
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,599
this old school OG variety that's super

676
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,720
gassy super special in my opinion

677
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,719
different than everything else that's

678
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,558
going on right now super Frosty but it's

679
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,919
sticky loud like extremely like pungent

680
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:51,678
where it burns your nose but it's OG and

681
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,320
you just don't see gassy stuff like that

682
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,038
anymore not really not really we've got

683
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,278
uh we probably have two I mean we get we

684
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,558
get a little a little bit of gas from

685
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,480
our uh our gorilla goo but not not like

686
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,200
the old we talking about that yesterday

687
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,360
it's funny how we have these reoccurring

688
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,240
things like Gorilla Glue keeps popping

689
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:14,000
back up and you know I like Gorilla Glue

690
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,960
for what it is it it kind of like came

691
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,519
in and I'm one of the guys who got the

692
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:24,360
cut from uh Josie Wales in

693
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:26,759
2013 and I believe it was 2013 at the

694
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,719
cup in La it was either that or 2014

695
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:33,558
right at the end there of 13 or early

696
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,399
part of 14 at the cup in San Bernardino

697
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:37,519
and they were they did the best thing

698
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,319
ever was they gave the cut out to

699
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,278
everybody and that blew it up they had

700
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,158
won the cup and they gave out clones to

701
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,278
everybody and then it just spread like

702
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,278
wildfire I gave it to a bunch of my

703
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,119
friends uh we made moms of it and momed

704
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,960
it out and gave cuts to everybody and

705
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,918
then it replaced Sour Diesel within

706
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,798
about a year of all the people that were

707
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
growing sour diesel for not not all of

708
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,839
them but a lot of

709
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,080
them uh especially up on the hills in

710
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,959
somoma meno humble that were growing

711
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,960
sour it was like get something that's

712
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,120
gassy it's better yields and finishes

713
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,079
earlier so you don't have to worry about

714
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,000
rain you don't have to worry about

715
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,918
Bettis and PM and all these other issues

716
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,558
big big flowers on that planet big

717
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,600
chunky and it's like it's got some

718
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:20,440
chocolate notes in it too it was like

719
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:23,480
really funky gas with chocolate notes it

720
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,880
was complex oh for sure for sure and

721
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,120
strong and like the effect was strong

722
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,840
yeah you can't you can't really find

723
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,798
those cuts anymore not at least not the

724
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,359
the stable ones I've tried the a few

725
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,240
times now and most of the ones I picked

726
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,119
up just Herm for gorilla yeah oh dude we

727
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,240
I can get you a gorilla cut we can get

728
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,959
the gg4 no problem like that's that's

729
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,480
another one that's it's in culture so it

730
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,120
takes a few months but yeah that one's

731
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,159
around uh we got we got a good amount of

732
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,158
stuff chem 91 is coming out of culture

733
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,679
right now I'm about to give that back to

734
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:57,480
Greg uh yeah good I like chem 91 that's

735
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,440
that the 91 chem dog is extremely

736
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,919
special in my opinion it's like it's got

737
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,480
its own kind of gas you know it's that

738
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,278
burnt Tire chemi kind of you know the

739
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,720
structure is not the best on it it's got

740
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,480
decent structure but it's it's soft the

741
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,600
the buds are soft and they're they're

742
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,880
nice big buds it's like open bra but

743
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,398
it's not like uh not like sour diesel

744
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,840
where it completely fingers out where

745
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,199
you got these stacked bracks or fox

746
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,720
tails that you know and Sour Diesel

747
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,000
doesn't always fox tail like that but a

748
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,839
lot of times it does yeah I feel like a

749
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,038
lot of the uh not a lot of them but a

750
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,879
fair amount of some of the older

751
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,000
genetics fox tail a good

752
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,000
bit yeah and I think that can be a

753
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,960
quality thing too I'm okay with fox tail

754
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,398
as long as it's fire yeah

755
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,200
like but I come from a time where it

756
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:45,879
didn't matter as much what it looked

757
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,200
like it was all about the loudness and

758
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,200
the effect which I think people are

759
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,880
going to start going back towards I feel

760
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,319
like with white Thorn Rose hitting the

761
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,679
market as strong as it did this year I'm

762
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,960
not sure if you're familiar with that

763
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,840
one but white Thorn hit hard and that's

764
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,000
from Huckleberry Hill Farms and it's one

765
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:06,439
of those feel-good strains it's not the

766
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,919
strongest in the world but it just makes

767
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,278
you feel great it's all about the effect

768
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,360
the the trips are good too but man that

769
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,119
effect is what's up yeah I I'm

770
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,359
anticipating something similar with with

771
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:19,879
a market shift like that most bang for

772
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:21,839
your buck mentality you know how much

773
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,960
can I get in a bag with the highest THC

774
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,079
with the lowest cost I think that's

775
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,600
going to you know I'm sure it'll always

776
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,839
be there for certain consumers but I

777
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,759
think there's going to be a different

778
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:32,519
you know demographic that's going to

779
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,679
come out similar to folks that like wine

780
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,200
and you know good drinks like good mixed

781
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,278
drinks where people are just looking for

782
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,798
specific flavor profiles things to pair

783
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,440
things with flavor Chasers we got lots

784
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,398
of flavor Chasers out there and now with

785
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,919
the potential I mean we're kind of

786
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,398
talking about making salads the other

787
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,960
day about mixing up different flour

788
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,398
definitely rosin can be easily Blended

789
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,120
where you can take 25% this we're going

790
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:56,918
to do Skittles 75 and we're going to

791
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,798
throw in something else to make it

792
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,519
special you know or whatever 5050 you

793
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:03,558
know I think you can really you know the

794
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,839
options are Limitless on the directions

795
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:08,960
you can go with blending especially with

796
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,959
stuff like rosin or

797
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:14,480
extract tell me what you think of

798
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,960
that should let you dry hit it that's

799
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,200
the dirt

800
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,558
Skittles uh soil grown so we did an

801
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,399
interesting test where we took Skittles

802
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,918
grown in soil and Skittles grown in

803
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,918
cocoa that was the only difference

804
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,080
throughout the whole cycle same light

805
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,038
same nutrition United

806
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,839
nutrients and uh the only difference was

807
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,640
the

808
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,158
substrate so versus cocoa and then we

809
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,919
smoked them side by side we did it on

810
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,880
the show with hi from Humble seed

811
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,640
company and it's like so significant

812
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,840
flavor-wise I I agree this the best best

813
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,759
food I've ever smoked was definitely

814
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,278
living soil blueberry diesel like

815
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,599
probably 2016 or something yeah I like

816
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,440
that blueberry diesel that's a good one

817
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:03,000
too so good so that's the best thing

818
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,360
you've ever smoked nice yeah it's funny

819
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,398
cuz like from batch to batch I've smoked

820
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,519
amazing things all over Skittles the

821
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:11,759
best batch of Skittles that I ever

822
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,679
smoked was this one right here um yeah

823
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:17,119
and it really dude this stuff coats uh

824
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:20,200
the ash yeah I rolled this one too this

825
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,398
is a fatty i r four four gramers I feel

826
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,798
like you get better flavor if you're a

827
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,038
flavor

828
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,319
Chaser not the bigger the better always

829
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,200
but there's that sweet spot it's

830
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,079
depending on the tip too you're using

831
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,480
like a 12 or a 10 uh it it hits

832
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,759
different you get better air flow and

833
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,720
you get more

834
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,359
TPS so and everyone's got their own

835
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,919
thing going on you know some of and this

836
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,319
this ash isn't looking as pretty today

837
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,399
as it did yesterday but we'll smoke some

838
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,918
of the other ones too I mean dirt

839
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:50,319
Skittles something special about it love

840
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,278
Skittles oh yeah this one's

841
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,119
coats it's got a good coat but yeah I

842
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,759
think I R so the thing with that I'm

843
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,158
learning with hand rolls we call them

844
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,359
hand rolls instead of pre-rolls but with

845
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,080
the hand rolls uh you want to smoke them

846
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,119
fresh too after you roll them they start

847
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:08,240
to even if you put them in a joint

848
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,759
tube they're not quite as good a week

849
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
later as they would be for the first

850
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,119
couple days and they're good this is

851
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,319
still amazing but it's just a little bit

852
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,158
more mouth coating I feel like you're

853
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,038
getting more TPS yeah yeah they're

854
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,360
volatile you know evaporate off at room

855
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,720
temperature yeah so and each cultivar is

856
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,719
different some cultivars are good for

857
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,240
months they're exactly once they hit

858
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,960
their Peak they're good and you could

859
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,159
put them in a tur Block Bag or whatever

860
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,919
we just have those guys on but love

861
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,240
those bags me too I absolutely love them

862
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,320
they're they're a game changer in my

863
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,679
opinion uh they change my life and also

864
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm like one of those guys who doesn't

865
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,399
believe things are good A lot of times

866
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,038
and there's so much snake oil out there

867
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm like yeah right another myar bag

868
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:46,759
that's better cool it's thick but no if

869
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,319
you actually do your your homework and

870
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:49,519
you you do any trials with them you'll

871
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,960
see that they're better especially

872
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,759
better than turkey bags better than

873
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,240
mason jars I mean mason jars your buds

874
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,519
don't get smashed that's the only

875
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,798
benefit um and I think using a

876
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,278
controlled environment where it's cool

877
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:03,480
then you don't have to the guesswork you

878
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,599
pull the guesswork out if you're using a

879
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,798
trip blck especially like in that curing

880
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,439
phase where you don't have to burp it

881
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:13,638
because a lot of people they screw it up

882
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,399
within that you know post Harvest uh for

883
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,199
the week after two weeks after three

884
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:19,879
weeks after they're not releasing that

885
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,278
CO2 out of the bag and uh if you don't

886
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,200
release it then moisture gets trapped in

887
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:27,599
the plant and that's what tur blocks do

888
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,480
exactly exactly and you know from uh you

889
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,278
know operational perspective it just

890
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,440
makes sense for you know efficiency

891
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,278
right because then you're not having you

892
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,399
know a couple of guys that are strictly

893
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:37,319
just running around depending on the

894
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,798
scale right popping toads popping

895
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,119
buckets popping turkey bags well and

896
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,879
that when we were talking about this

897
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,038
yesterday but then it be when you got

898
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,840
people man manually doing it uh it

899
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:52,240
becomes an art where you have to be

900
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:54,158
skilled you put it in a turp blck it's

901
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,319
it's uh mechanically done instead of

902
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,320
manually done and then okay it does it

903
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,720
itself like you just you don't have to

904
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,678
worry about that that's one less thing

905
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,159
you have to worry about and the less

906
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,240
things you have to worry about that you

907
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,679
know we're going to be successful the

908
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,919
better your end product is probably

909
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,278
going to be oh yeah 100% then you could

910
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,200
focus the you know your efforts you

911
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,159
would have spent on that somewhere else

912
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,319
totally yeah I'm all about efficiencies

913
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,840
it's all about efficiencies at the end

914
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,000
uh especially when you're getting into

915
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:20,319
scale and cost efficiencies where you're

916
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,480
trying to save money because at the end

917
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:25,119
of the day you know especially with guys

918
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,960
that are producing flour it's like such

919
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,199
a competition and race to the bottom of

920
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,639
you're in the middle if you're creating

921
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,319
a superior product not so much the race

922
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:35,319
to the bottom but you still have to be

923
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,960
conscious of your price absolutely I

924
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,599
mean price compression is hitting

925
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,679
everybody you know at a national level

926
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,079
you know with the exception of a few

927
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,759
states that are just you know opening up

928
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,038
with medical markets but just a matter

929
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,278
of time being cognizant of that from the

930
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,839
very beginning having the right you know

931
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,679
mechanical equipment in place the right

932
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,959
workflow having the right people there

933
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:55,120
to get things done the right way goes a

934
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,038
long way it goes a long way having good

935
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,518
staff is everything and good work

936
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,960
culture like

937
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:01,599
you know that's that's everything too

938
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,319
people want to you your people want to

939
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,439
come to work they enjoy working it's

940
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,038
like they wouldn't want to be anywhere

941
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,919
else that's when you got to a winning

942
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,519
recipe oh yeah yeah if you're not

943
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,360
involved in the Kickball the Kickball

944
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,200
teams the softball leagues and the the

945
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,678
mud volleyball and all that stuff with

946
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,679
the team you should be yeah yeah well

947
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,080
it's those little things like uh that

948
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,038
make a huge difference because it's

949
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,678
stressful a lot of times even you know

950
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:28,679
the little jobs can be stressful at

951
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,759
times you know we don't do any hand

952
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:34,278
I'm done with hand watering um we will

953
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,960
handw water in a tent but like that's

954
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,679
another one I I've had friends that were

955
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,200
hand watering forever and finally have

956
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,440
switched over in the last couple years

957
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,200
and it's like man you just have so much

958
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,840
time for other things and it's one less

959
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,360
thing you you don't have to worry about

960
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,959
and you don't have to train somebody on

961
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,959
and hope they're doing it correctly

962
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,480
exactly you get that consistency yeah

963
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,519
and it's repeatable like it's one of

964
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,798
those things is repeatable time and time

965
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,038
again and if you're doing five harvests

966
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:58,359
a year out of that room you know the

967
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,839
watering is going to be successful

968
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,519
because you got sensors it makes life

969
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,839
easier I want it I want those things to

970
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,279
be easy because there's so many other

971
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:11,119
things that'll stress you out yeah no

972
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,918
kidding so yeah like the market yeah I

973
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,519
mean everything's kind of volatile right

974
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:18,799
now but what state are you in again

975
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:21,119
Nevada Nevada nice so yeah and Nevada is

976
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,760
volatile too and you guys have you know

977
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,800
wreck has been introduced for the past

978
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,359
couple years but you guys have like one

979
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,280
of the largest dispensaries in the whole

980
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,639
world Planet 13 out in Vegas

981
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,960
yeah yeah they're they're a partner of

982
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,800
ours oh nice yeah they're crushing it oh

983
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,960
yeah Planet 13 does real well they also

984
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,760
have a great breakfast spot right across

985
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,838
inside that same building nice highly

986
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,639
recommend checking that place out yeah

987
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,759
so tell me one of the biggest things you

988
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,039
learned from writing this book probably

989
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,440
adjusting uh my own expectations of

990
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,159
things like uh you know kind of going

991
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,480
back to how we uh we started our talk

992
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,160
just being being patient with the

993
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,719
process more or less

994
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,078
yeah you know cuz and that and you know

995
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:04,799
don't let good get in the way of uh or

996
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,560
don't let perfect get in the way of good

997
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,079
right like me me and my co-author LC

998
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,320
Journey went back and forth a few times

999
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,560
like oh it's ready it's ready and then

1000
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,800
I'd like you know sit down read a

1001
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,599
chapter be like we could do better we

1002
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,720
could do better yeah or I'd read I'd

1003
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,800
read an article and be like H I feel

1004
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:19,319
like I feel like I should you know mix

1005
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,720
something from this into a certain

1006
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,960
section just because I think it's super

1007
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,838
important so it it's just like every

1008
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,159
time we thought we were about done there

1009
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,920
was just more and more and more I know

1010
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,279
that feeling yeah and it's funny cuz if

1011
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,920
you've never written a book you probably

1012
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,720
wouldn't relate to it as much but like

1013
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,240
mine I feel like there was information

1014
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,519
coming out at the last minute where we

1015
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,199
abstracts tech for instance wrote a

1016
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:41,559
white paper actually multiple white

1017
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:43,559
papers on flavorants which are they they

1018
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,279
did a bunch of research so flavor

1019
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:49,000
molecules like THS and sulfur based

1020
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,720
compounds volti surfur compounds oh yeah

1021
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,880
and so I had to include that in my book

1022
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,239
so we had to like add this to the Bild

1023
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,838
right before we going to layout we're

1024
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,799
like no we need to add this this has to

1025
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,318
be I talked to Angela and I'm like what

1026
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,359
do you think about this she's like yeah

1027
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:02,800
we should probably figure out how to

1028
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,759
include it it's like pretty gamechanging

1029
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,240
and you know I I actually read all the

1030
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,720
papers I showed them to a couple other

1031
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,239
people and we were like yeah this needs

1032
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,399
to be in the book like if we don't put

1033
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,159
in the book it's going to need to go in

1034
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,639
the next version but it's out right now

1035
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,399
and we haven't finalized everything even

1036
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,118
though we felt like we'd finalized

1037
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,599
everything and there was a whole bunch

1038
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,838
of little things like that and then

1039
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,160
photo placement where are we going to

1040
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,078
place all the photos that was kind of

1041
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,598
tricky yeah that that's a lengthy

1042
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,359
process man and then picking those

1043
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,160
photos too you know like you'll probably

1044
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,358
have five for each section you want one

1045
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,358
and then going through and well I like

1046
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,920
this one but she likes that one and you

1047
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,159
know Paul likes this one and then you

1048
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,639
know trying to come together and figure

1049
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,440
out you know what what's going to be the

1050
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,199
best for each section yeah I mean we had

1051
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,880
two photographers that did a lot of

1052
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,919
heavy lifting and then on top of that we

1053
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,838
had Arian from Greenhouse we had a seeds

1054
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,838
contributing photos we had so many

1055
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,799
people contributing photos um Kevin

1056
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:58,159
jodrey got me some uh there's a bunch of

1057
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,359
people in the industry that kind of were

1058
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,199
very helpful that we like yeah I'll help

1059
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:05,358
contribute to your book and uh you know

1060
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,759
Mojave Richmond is another guy

1061
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,559
contributed some really cool stuff we

1062
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,599
did case studies in my book too nice

1063
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:14,239
nice yeah we we tried to keep ours as uh

1064
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,318
as tighten it as possible you know a lot

1065
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,479
of previous books we had read not going

1066
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,440
to name any had uh you know tons of

1067
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,519
advertisements you know use this use

1068
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,760
that use these lights use these

1069
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:27,159
nutrients I won't do it yeah for that I

1070
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,560
feel like that it be it moves away from

1071
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,118
being textbook to being a magazine

1072
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,719
exactly we wanted to like preserve the

1073
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,119
authenticity and just have like you know

1074
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,719
raw you know usable information that's

1075
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,160
going to be applicable to you know the

1076
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,199
reason why folks should buy that book

1077
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,559
not like a hey you know shout out to

1078
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:43,318
this compan yeah where you're pushing

1079
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,799
people in any One Direction for products

1080
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:46,400
I just want to put the facts out there

1081
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,039
and let people make their mind up and

1082
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,079
yeah we do talk about some products but

1083
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,719
I I try to make it as non-biased as

1084
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,880
possible and just telling people the

1085
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,078
facts and you know that's that's the

1086
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,358
best way with the textbook it's supposed

1087
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,240
to be information for people to digest

1088
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:02,000
it's not supposed to be a magazine

1089
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,959
exactly I love that about your book too

1090
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,318
thank you thank you yeah I mean we

1091
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,280
mentioned a few products as well you

1092
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:08,000
know like Flor flex and Jack just for

1093
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,160
Simplicity right like from a costing

1094
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,559
perspective yeah can't beat you know one

1095
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,920
and a half cents per gallon start to

1096
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,880
finish on average Jax is the blue stuff

1097
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,119
right uh it's yeah white blue it's blue

1098
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,358
blue uh powder right yeah yeah yeah Jack

1099
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,838
I my buddy used Jack for a long swore by

1100
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:27,078
Ja I haven't used ja but uh I've seen

1101
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,318
some stuff growing with it it's all

1102
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,920
right yeah for for Simplicity yeah I

1103
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,039
would agree that's it you can't beat a

1104
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,559
one part yeah

1105
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,759
exactly and and the costing too you know

1106
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:38,880
like a lot of the nutrient lines

1107
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,960
nowadays 7 to 14 cents a gallon

1108
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,880
depending on you know how much you're

1109
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,720
ordering but yeah you just you know it's

1110
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,200
like that's why dry rather than by the

1111
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:51,239
gallon it's like using dry is like so

1112
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:53,358
much more economical and also like the

1113
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,439
carbon frit we got sold the idea that we

1114
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,559
need liquid fertilizers I mean it's so

1115
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,358
crazy CU you look at any other form of

1116
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,880
bag they're not they're not loaded up on

1117
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,358
these liquid 5 gallon concentrate

1118
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,880
bottles that they can you could get

1119
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,400
powder of oh yeah you know when you're

1120
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,880
buying a thousand pounds of salts versus

1121
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,200
uh you know the equivalent into liquid

1122
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,480
you're talking about you know tens of

1123
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,439
thousands of dollars and like Freight

1124
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,039
charges associated with that too not

1125
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,800
crazy yeah it's crazy once you start

1126
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,880
penciling it out like the difference in

1127
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,920
price uh just by the weight of the water

1128
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,680
exactly so yeah and I mean they have

1129
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,200
stabilizers and and the thing is is

1130
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,759
maybe we didn't have as good quality

1131
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,759
stuff before they didn't done all the

1132
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,680
R&amp;D for uh buffers and stabilizers and

1133
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,599
things like that and now we have that

1134
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,960
technology so it's very easy people

1135
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,079
understand it a lot better I mean

1136
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,800
there's only a handful of companies that

1137
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:44,400
actually make the dry powder for

1138
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,680
everybody anyway yeah so yeah and then

1139
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,480
there's the Cannabis tax because a lot

1140
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,440
of times you can go to the a world and

1141
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,400
get stuff for a that's Pennies on the

1142
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,800
dollar from the Cannabis stuff right I'm

1143
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,680
not hating on any nutrient companies I

1144
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,800
love you guys all I love I love all of

1145
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:58,799
the nutrient companies I agree I agree

1146
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,480
you used of them from advance to House

1147
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,000
and Garden to Cana uh yeah front row

1148
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,159
front row oh yeah I I like front row I

1149
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,119
like yeah I like Cana I got the Cana hat

1150
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:15,639
on today I I do I like uh Cutting Edge I

1151
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,760
like United is what we're using now uh

1152
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:20,239
Athena's

1153
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,880
fine uh dude I've used so many GH I've

1154
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,559
used GH I've tried a bunch I still use

1155
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,000
GH ph up nice yeah for the longest time

1156
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:32,159
I was doing this uh Botanicare with

1157
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,960
Floren Nova was the secret recipe it was

1158
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,920
like this super complex recipe that you

1159
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,639
could never use with dosers it it would

1160
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,800
because there was 18 different things

1161
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,039
and it's like uh yeah and it was

1162
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
complicated and it grew really good

1163
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:47,400
flour but uh man it's like those old

1164
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,199
recipes is the weed better or was the

1165
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,800
weed better back then with 18 things I

1166
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,078
don't think so no I don't either no I

1167
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,318
think you're over complicating stuff now

1168
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,400
I get at you know certain flesh recipes

1169
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,679
yeah you're going to have some different

1170
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,240
stuff and we have a special flush recipe

1171
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:02,759
that we have that was developed by one

1172
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:04,039
of our friends that that works

1173
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,119
phenomenal and it's got a bunch of

1174
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,679
components in it I was like looks like a

1175
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,358
lot we have to hand flush everything but

1176
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:15,000
but you get white ash and you get really

1177
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,559
good flavor so at the end of the day the

1178
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,039
proof is in the pudding yeah it's all

1179
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,960
about the flavor yeah so what do you

1180
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:22,719
think about flush flush uh I I talked to

1181
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,720
Bruce Bugsby about this actually before

1182
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,279
speaking on a facility design at the

1183
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,199
Cannabis business times conference like

1184
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,680
a year or two ago yeah and uh you know

1185
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,039
from a plant physiology perspective it

1186
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,279
doesn't make any sense to deprive the

1187
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,679
plant of nutrients up until Harvest and

1188
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,319
when people do flush depending on what

1189
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:38,960
you are flushing right if you know some

1190
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:41,679
people who do just Ro or just tap water

1191
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,358
or phed water you know if you de your

1192
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,519
plant of calcium you know that'll result

1193
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,239
in Bettis you know if you do it for too

1194
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,679
long are you actually flushing the

1195
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:50,358
flower anyway like when you look at the

1196
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,919
plant what's deficient the flowers

1197
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:53,199
aren't deficient the the foliage is

1198
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,440
deficient right so you'll see that fade

1199
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,799
in the foliage but it's not really

1200
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,200
affecting the flow yeah so there's a you

1201
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,599
know 10 ways to look at it and break it

1202
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,879
down is it's something you're doing for

1203
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,760
a costing perspective you know in terms

1204
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,880
of a year you know 56 chops cut out you

1205
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,560
know four days that could be some

1206
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,280
savings depending on the uh the scale of

1207
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,838
the operation but yeah as far as uh you

1208
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,160
know quality of the finish product goes

1209
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,199
I think there's something to be said

1210
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:19,558
about like uh you know how the

1211
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,679
chlorophyll can break down and uh you

1212
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,400
know how that flour can cure Yeah by

1213
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,759
removing some of that well and then

1214
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,000
calcium I think a lot of people are

1215
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,720
using calcium to get whiter Ash

1216
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
um and I think I hear different opinions

1217
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,679
on calcium and the benefits of actually

1218
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,679
calcium is it uptaking a bunch of that

1219
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,039
calcium is it not but I'm seeing better

1220
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,558
better Ash with

1221
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,279
calcium so yeah and then you know I

1222
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,240
think molasses is another big one

1223
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,040
putting sugar in there oh yeah carbal

1224
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,399
some carbal load some sweet oh yeah some

1225
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,920
of those simple and complex sugars yeah

1226
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,800
I I think that's great I think it's

1227
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,960
great I mean at the end of the

1228
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,920
day if you can improve the flavor why

1229
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,720
not do it yeah I agree so and also make

1230
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,559
it more smooth if there's ways to make

1231
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:05,598
it more smooth increase the flavor I'm

1232
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:07,839
all for it same it's all about that that

1233
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,599
end user experience right right well

1234
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:09,920
because at the end of day you're

1235
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,160
providing experience for the customer

1236
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,240
it's just like a chef would for uh

1237
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,519
someone dining at their restaurant you

1238
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,039
know and flower is no different it's a

1239
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,480
fresh product and it comes out slightly

1240
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:24,800
different even at scale even the the

1241
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,599
best environments there's still uh

1242
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,559
slight variation because there's so many

1243
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,440
things that go on it's not exactly the

1244
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,640
same product that comes out every

1245
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,519
Harvest um yeah you can get a lot more

1246
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,879
similar the more dialed in your system

1247
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,599
is especially like using like rock wool

1248
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,960
you know you start talking chemotypes

1249
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,359
you can get tighter chemotype

1250
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,159
Expressions uh but it still is a living

1251
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:48,000
product it can change from time to time

1252
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,039
and also you get some systemic bacteria

1253
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,159
in there you can get a totally different

1254
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:55,079
expression or you get some stressors

1255
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:57,159
some thrips some mites whatever it is

1256
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,200
you know it's like induce those jasmonic

1257
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,558
Pathways get some different responses

1258
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,679
mhm yeah stressors will make the plant

1259
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,800
more turpy that's just a known fact oh

1260
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,000
yeah so I have friends that have thrips

1261
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,280
and their their stuff is super turpy and

1262
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,119
they're like what's cool and I'm like

1263
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,599
well don't ever come to my facility but

1264
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,160
yeah yeah I mean they might have a point

1265
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,519
to a degree so and I think there is a

1266
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:22,318
couple there is a couple compounds or or

1267
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:24,880
uh brands that are making uh things to

1268
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:28,279
foler that actually act as stressors

1269
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,119
yeah yeah harpon proteins yeah yeah

1270
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,960
really cool definitely yeah and I mean

1271
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,838
we're still learning about the plant I'm

1272
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,480
excited about Innovation always learning

1273
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,838
about the second you stop learning

1274
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,039
that's that's where you know your

1275
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:44,239
improvements of uh any kind of quality

1276
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,079
stop right so as far as data collection

1277
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,000
how much data collection do you guys do

1278
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,400
uh we do a lot I couldn't off the top of

1279
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,519
my head probably give you a data point

1280
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,800
number but I mean many different data

1281
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,920
points from the substrate the

1282
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,318
environmentals the climate ppfd readings

1283
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,119
uh we get a lot of data points just from

1284
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:00,239
like an efficiency perspective with our

1285
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,760
shift reports from all of our

1286
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,719
supervisors you know what's getting done

1287
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,040
how long did it take right we're also in

1288
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:08,598
the middle of building a very robust uh

1289
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:10,079
addition to our uh cultivation

1290
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:11,480
management software now where we're

1291
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,640
adding costing in so we're going to

1292
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,679
actually be able to you know apply true

1293
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:17,239
cost to to everything like how long did

1294
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,039
it take you know down to the milliliter

1295
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:21,399
of everything used to the to the hour of

1296
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,239
Labor yeah that's a yeah I mean that's

1297
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,480
how you get efficiencies you improve oh

1298
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,358
yeah more data points do you guys

1299
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,639
measure your plants going

1300
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:34,719
into for for for growth on a weekly or

1301
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:36,078
daily basis ever um I used to for for

1302
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:37,759
different things when I start new things

1303
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,119
out you know like measuring inter noal

1304
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,000
spacing and stand diameter all that

1305
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,480
stuff but I've kind of moved away from

1306
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,400
that to where it's not as beneficial

1307
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,838
information after a period of time

1308
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,440
exactly yeah and then dialing in your

1309
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:52,639
ppfd what is the best way to dial your

1310
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,920
ppfd in really looking for plant

1311
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,519
responses you know as you're photo

1312
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,760
acclimating things if you you know see

1313
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,119
an adverse plant response where it's

1314
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,880
like oh you know obviously the plant's

1315
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,280
got too much light because you know it

1316
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,480
has that slight it's not turgid right

1317
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,079
the turgidity of the plant with the

1318
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,199
water pushing on the S walls just isn't

1319
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,359
happening they're not praying as

1320
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:10,000
everybody calls the leaves you know you

1321
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:12,039
you want to see that turgidity like if

1322
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,519
your VPD is dialed in a room you'll see

1323
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:15,759
your turgidity like if your light's good

1324
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,159
your BPD is good yeah you know you got

1325
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,160
good pressure in the root Zone that's

1326
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,199
what you're going to see yeah you want

1327
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:23,440
happy healthy plants right whether

1328
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,879
you're cutting clones whether you're

1329
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,679
flowering whatever yeah you you want

1330
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,519
praying plants yeah that just being

1331
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,558
cognizant of those those light levels

1332
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,199
right like certain certain ones can take

1333
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,559
more than others and just knowing that

1334
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,279
going into the game you know not trying

1335
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,599
to use that cookie cutter to every

1336
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,480
single one of your rooms every single

1337
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,720
part of your room going in and knowing

1338
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,800
that you know old school limits if we

1339
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,598
can get over 600 micromoles in here it's

1340
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,318
not going to like it yeah then your gush

1341
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,760
M you can hit with you know 1,00

1342
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,039
micromoles it's wild you know it's gonna

1343
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,520
throw down five a light yeah yeah you're

1344
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:57,119
going for that same thing with the super

1345
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:58,960
boo yields like crazy exactly so yeah

1346
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,599
and do you see the future of people

1347
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,599
pushing even higher uh numbers per

1348
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,079
square foot it depends on how you look

1349
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,000
at it I actually had some conversations

1350
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:09,119
with some of my uh my gran buddies

1351
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,639
recently and they were talking about the

1352
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,358
setup in Amsterdam where they

1353
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,039
essentially had like these it was like

1354
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:15,440
Ean flood style clone tray where it's

1355
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,318
like right from clone flipping into

1356
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,639
flower right and they were boiling down

1357
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:20,880
the cting per square foot with the yield

1358
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:22,719
you know if you look at it as like a

1359
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,240
stacked square foot you know I'm sure

1360
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,318
there's creative ways to go about doing

1361
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,159
it yeah you know if you you bed your

1362
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,400
plants you know anything longer than

1363
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,679
three and a half weeks I'm sure you can

1364
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,240
get more but then you know you're have

1365
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:33,480
to account for that in other ways in

1366
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,759
your room like you're have to increase

1367
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,280
your deification capacity your cooling

1368
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,440
all of that so there'll just be other

1369
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,240
things set have to grow with that yeah

1370
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,838
what are your thoughts on underc canopy

1371
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,719
underc canopy I think it's great for uh

1372
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:48,400
for a lot of uh applications you know

1373
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,000
like there's a lot of different parts of

1374
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,280
the plant that can accept light that can

1375
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,280
benefit the plant you know and a lot of

1376
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,119
the lights that are out there now don't

1377
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,760
get as much penetration through the

1378
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,440
canopy right like uh certain ones do you

1379
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,040
know like the uh the fos 3 eyes I'm

1380
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,800
using now I can get you know upwards of

1381
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,159
three to four hair micro mols after a

1382
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,839
good defa down run those lowers you know

1383
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,000
I'll get soft balls top to bottom but

1384
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:12,799
you know if you don't have something

1385
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,119
like that under canopy would definitely

1386
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,960
be something advantageous to implement

1387
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,119
and you typically thin uh multiple times

1388
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,318
throughout flower and and through veg or

1389
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,559
what's your process for thinning

1390
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:28,039
typically so for for def falling I'll do

1391
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:31,839
like a light Def and uh like veg and

1392
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:34,000
then day 21 between days 21 and uh 28 we

1393
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,119
go through do a light skirt pull the

1394
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,079
lower third off and then uh hit about a

1395
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,838
60 65% def top to bottom nice yeah and

1396
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,039
then we get a final deall probably you

1397
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:47,000
know seven week seven nice yeah really

1398
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,440
strip them oh yeah like if it's not

1399
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,519
Sugar Leaf it goes at that point yeah

1400
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,880
well makes harvesting easier all that

1401
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,400
stuff and it's not necessary to have

1402
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,480
those leaves on for a yield at that

1403
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,838
point exactly yeah and then for you know

1404
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,039
anything biomass and makes it to

1405
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,039
extraction you know we're not going to

1406
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,159
have you know 14% testing trim the trim

1407
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,519
is going to test just as high as the

1408
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,719
flower and that translates into you know

1409
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:08,480
improved costing for everything

1410
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:10,358
Downstream in our production lab as well

1411
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,159
totally yeah that's a good way to look

1412
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:15,838
at it for sure let's talk about drying

1413
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:17,279
and curing because I think uh you know

1414
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:20,318
what is your preferred method for

1415
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,920
drawing and caring low and slow man 6060

1416
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,358
tried and true like I know a lot of Ops

1417
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,920
might not have the real estate to to

1418
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:29,159
hold things this long right but but if

1419
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,880
you do loan slow is the way to go yeah

1420
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:32,960
and some people don't have I've I've

1421
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,680
seen this a lot where their AC's don't

1422
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,798
go down to 60 they can only go down to

1423
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:41,039
65 or 62 62 is fine 65 is pushing it

1424
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:42,440
yeah you don't want to you don't want to

1425
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,079
let perfect get in the way the good

1426
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,838
sometimes things like that you know if

1427
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,839
you have an extra day yeah not gonna not

1428
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:52,000
going to defeat you yeah and then curing

1429
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:54,798
TPL blocks you guys use Turlock bins do

1430
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,239
you guys use 100 like the we have the

1431
00:49:54,798 --> 00:50:00,679
liners and our our 37 gon tots throw the

1432
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:03,118
Bas in there you know just for

1433
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:04,919
redundancy and then once we actually lot

1434
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,559
things out they go into the five pound

1435
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,680
lot grow bags Turlock so yeah with the

1436
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:11,040
Bita yeah that's great I've never heard

1437
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,000
of that before that's actually that's

1438
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,119
new to me that's that's an interesting

1439
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,838
concept I like redundancies though I'm

1440
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,440
all about redundancies so that's you

1441
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:21,039
know it's like my life is built on

1442
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,079
redundancies oh yeah yeah gotta think

1443
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:23,639
about that when you're planning the

1444
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,760
operation out too you know if something

1445
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,078
goes down you know how are we going to

1446
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,200
make sure all these rooms get watered

1447
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,680

not the right not the right kind of

1465
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:08,920
Golden Goat exactly yeah completely

1466
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:12,000
golden plants it looks like a a field of

1467
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,838
wheat literally crispy crispy that's the

1468
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,440
worst not even not even biomass worthy

1469
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,838
that makes my stomach churn a little bit

1470
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,920
just because I've seen it before and it

1471
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,838
just yeah I feel for the people that it

1472
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,838
happens to

1473
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:29,440
MH we're not even touching this thing

1474
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,559
have to put some work in yeah yeah tell

1475
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,920
me about the first time you started

1476
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,680
smoking cannabis I was living in South

1477
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,960
Carolina at the time my uh was one of my

1478
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:41,078
friend's older brothers he uh had had

1479
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,679
some weed uh we tried it didn't get high

1480
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:44,559
the first time tried it again like a

1481
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:46,798
week later and just I love the way it

1482
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,599
made me feel you know I had a bit of

1483
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:50,559
anxiousness to me kind of always have

1484
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,440
and every time that I ingest smoke

1485
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,400
cannabis you know whether it's an edible

1486
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,079
or tincture like it's it seems to

1487
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,760
mitigate that completely for for me so

1488
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,880
it was uh it was love it second smoke

1489
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,440
for me yeah yeah I feel like a lot of us

1490
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,480
do the same thing it's like the first

1491
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,559
time you smoke you don't know how to

1492
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,280
smoke or you don't know how to inhale

1493
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,960
properly and you get caught up in

1494
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,599
everything and then you don't get

1495
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,079
high and uh Edibles can fix that real

1496
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,440
quick oh I've been humbled by some

1497
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:21,680
Boulder bars oh man I've been humbled by

1498
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,679
Edibles too I just I like raos and

1499
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,798
gummies I don't do too much the Edibles

1500
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,279
these days it's just uh they're for me

1501
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:30,480
they're so strong but I can smoke all

1502
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,160
day long no problem but then when it

1503
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,639
comes to Edibles they just they take it

1504
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,960
seems like they take forever to kick in

1505
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,000
then once they kick in I want them to be

1506
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,079
like more

1507
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,679
mellow sometimes or I take too much 50

1508
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:44,880
milligrams is too much for me which a

1509
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:47,239
lot of people that's fine you know I'm

1510
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,838
more of like the TW it it depends too it

1511
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:51,358
really depends on what it is and who

1512
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:52,880
made it and time of day time of day what

1513
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:54,400
I'm doing if I'm at a concert I'm not

1514
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,280
thinking about it yeah it's totally fine

1515
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,960
or if I'm flying and I'm going to sleep

1516
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,319
exactly yeah I think my sweet spot's

1517
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,039
probably right around 40 to 50 as well

1518
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:05,639
but I got some friends that are like 500

1519
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:08,159
milligrams give it to me I'm ready you

1520
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:09,838
know and I'm not I'm not that guy so but

1521
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,960
roll me up a fat joint and we'll smoke

1522
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:15,920
it we'll smoke two you know hanging out

1523
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,119
uh and that's what I enjoy I enjoy

1524
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,639
sitting I also enjoy the experience of

1525
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:20,960
hanging out with my friends and smoking

1526
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:23,000
you know it's

1527
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,159
it's part of the whole experience where

1528
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,239
you can talk to somebody you can hang

1529
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,440
out and smoke and you get to know new

1530
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,558
people people feel like over a period of

1531
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,280
a big joint in an hour you can learn a

1532
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,119
lot about

1533
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,760
somebody you know and there's funny

1534
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:38,599
things like you can tell about people if

1535
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,000
they gum the joint and get it all wet

1536
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:42,280
you know what I mean or if if they make

1537
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,719
the joint run because they hit it too

1538
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,720
hard it's like all these little things

1539
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:48,078
it's like character flaws I can spot the

1540
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:51,439
character Flaws by the way they smoke

1541
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:55,359
The Joint true

1542
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,920
so you know I don't hate on anybody but

1543
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,318
so it's gross to have a joint it's all

1544
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,159
wet oh I agree are you going to be

1545
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:04,279
working on another book or another

1546
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,399
version of this book in the near future

1547
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,599
I I would definitely like to I think uh

1548
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,920
my

1549
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,720
biggest imp well the biggest Improvement

1550
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,519
that I think that we could make you know

1551
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:19,480
uh for me at least is uh the

1552
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:21,159
illustrations I spent uh probably weeks

1553
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,679
reaching out to different Botanical

1554
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:25,159
artists on LinkedIn trying to you know

1555
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:26,719
try to network and find folks had a

1556
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:28,798
couple artists with them my friend but

1557
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,199
it just like wasn't their their ballpark

1558
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,920
oh I got the guys and uh I got the guys

1559
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,798
when you're ready perfect we ended up

1560
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,680
going with uh I forget the website but

1561
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:39,119
is essentially like you know one of

1562
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:40,480
those uh like workb type websites where

1563
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,640
you have folks that have different skill

1564
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,480
sets you go on they're like hey I need

1565
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,118
these made by this and ended up paying

1566
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,760
like you know 50 bucks an illustration

1567
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,240
and I think they came out well they're

1568
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,359
very practical and it's easy to tell

1569
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,199
what we're you know depicting with

1570
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,199
different sections but right I think a

1571
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:55,798
Botanical artist that was gifted and was

1572
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:57,439
C passionate about cannabis could put a

1573
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:59,000
whole different been on the book and it

1574
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,079
would change it yeah and now with

1575
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,639
technology it's amazing what you can do

1576
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:06,280
with with art and with incorporating

1577
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:08,118
those type of things in books so yeah we

1578
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,079
got a really good layout hery did the

1579
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:13,160
layout in our book and she's just

1580
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,318
amazing but then we had we had multiple

1581
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:16,598
people do illustrations which was great

1582
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:18,880
because we were on a deadline to get it

1583
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:20,720
done I was told by somebody not going to

1584
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,200
name any names but you know who you are

1585
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,558
said that there's no way I could get

1586
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:25,919
this book done in a year and so that lit

1587
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,440
a fire under my ass and I was like

1588
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,519
there's no way I'm going to listen to

1589
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,119
this guy I can do whatever I want and I

1590
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,000
can get this book done and so I got the

1591
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:37,318
book done in way less than a year um I

1592
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
had my draft and it was done in into

1593
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:41,440
print uh you know it didn't get done as

1594
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,559
quickly as I was hoping but it was done

1595
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,119
in less than a year how long did it take

1596
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:47,920
for you to find the printing company for

1597
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,960
like the page the quality the you know

1598
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,760
binding well I wanted to go with the US

1599
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,559
company and yeah we had to go through

1600
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,760
you know and see what I knew I wanted on

1601
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,480
the cover was I wanted something

1602
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,119
different I didn't want another grow

1603
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,559
book I wanted a they had a big plant

1604
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,039
with a black background because

1605
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,519
everybody had that and that's why I love

1606
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:06,799
your book too that's another thing is

1607
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,038
like okay well this it's not just

1608
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:10,719
another grow book that has you know a

1609
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,280
beautiful Bud on the cover with a black

1610
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,358
background so we put a seat on the cover

1611
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,839
of mine and then I wanted soft touch

1612
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:18,038
those were like the two things that I

1613
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:19,318
knew that I wanted and then it was like

1614
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:21,160
thickness there's so many different

1615
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:24,079
thicknesses and the first printing I did

1616
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:26,798
we got a smaller run we did a run of 420

1617
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,359
and it was a thicker page and so it was

1618
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,358
a thicker book and I like the thickness

1619
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:32,519
of the book but when it comes to

1620
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:35,038
shipping we had talked to Khalifa

1621
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:37,119
genetics and a couple other people U and

1622
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:39,400
decided to go with a thinner book that

1623
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,079
it was easier to flip through the pages

1624
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,318
and it was slightly it wasn't it was

1625
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:45,839
still it's still a heavy book it weighs

1626
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:46,960
a kilo right or or 1.75 pounds or

1627
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,558
something like that so it's not quite a

1628
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,720
kilo but it's

1629
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,160
heavy but for shipping it's cheaper than

1630
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:56,279
something that weighs 2.5 kilos so we

1631
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:57,920
went with something thinner it made more

1632
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,720
sense for shipping and it's easier to

1633
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,960
read so yeah and your book was put it

1634
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:03,679
feels like a textbook it feels like

1635
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,400
something I would buy in college for

1636
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:08,118
$300 uh but yeah I think your your book

1637
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,240
what is the retail in your book oh it's

1638
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:12,000
retailing at 200 we went with like the

1639
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,519
highest quality materials for everything

1640
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,798
we we tried out a number of different

1641
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:18,960
things including Amazon Printing and so

1642
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:22,038
for me I I really thought Amazon print

1643
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,400
on demand was going to be the ticket or

1644
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,760
uh there was a couple other companies we

1645
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,880
were looking for I don't need to name

1646
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,760
names but I thought man that was going

1647
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,240
to be the way to go I could just pay for

1648
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,319
it but they'll give me a percentage by

1649
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,358
the each but it was way too expensive it

1650
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,440
didn't make sense that's the other

1651
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:37,798
reason self-publishing it's like a lot

1652
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,079
of times these Publishers will give you

1653
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:41,280
you know like my book 55 it's a little

1654
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,160
more expensive than it probably should

1655
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,000
be but I self-published it and so we

1656
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:47,038
have to buy smaller runs of it same

1657
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,199
thing with yours it's like it's maybe

1658
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,839
more expensive than people think it

1659
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,919
should be but it's because you had to

1660
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:52,119
pay so much more because you're buying

1661
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,639
smaller runs and you're doing it all

1662
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:56,480
yourself exactly right and so I didn't

1663
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,199
want to only make a dollar a book and

1664
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,358
probably not make any money for two or

1665
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:02,759
three years till the book had paid for

1666
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:04,558
itself uh and that's why you a lot of

1667
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,200
times what happens guys when you use

1668
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,640
Publishers is you go to the publisher

1669
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:10,038
they pay for all the books they do the

1670
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,679
heavy lifting in that regard with the

1671
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:14,240
money and then you get a royalty on your

1672
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:16,519
book and a lot of times it's a very

1673
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,798
small royalty or you might not get any

1674
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:20,639
royalty if your book's not good enough

1675
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,440
to ever pay for itself right but if you

1676
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,199
do it yourself it's all on your

1677
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,880
shoulders if your book fails it's your

1678
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,279
failure it's not the fail failure of

1679
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,079
some somebody else or their money it's

1680
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,400
your money and I love that it's like I

1681
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm willing to die for my book y same

1682
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,760
same yeah it just didn't make sense to

1683
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,679
work with anybody else cuz you know the

1684
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,000
book cost to print you know would be

1685
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:41,399
more than whatever that percentage would

1686
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,119
have ended up being as well so it was

1687
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,519
almost a yeah as you were saying yeah

1688
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:48,200
you would have had to charge 150 or 175

1689
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:50,280
on Amazon just to be able to make a

1690
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:51,439
profit exactly and that doesn't make

1691
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,839
sense and not that there's anything

1692
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,480
wrong with that some people might be

1693
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:57,199
okay with that but it's like you want

1694
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,920
something that's somewhat affordable to

1695
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,519
people but also you're you're putting

1696
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:05,559
good information out there so and your

1697
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:08,159
yours does work as a coffee table book

1698
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:09,720
um also as a textbook you know I think

1699
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,719
there's GNA there's going to be a need

1700
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:14,000
for textbooks in colleges on cannabis

1701
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:15,318
you know with the way things are going

1702
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,358
and the amount of jobs that are out

1703
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:20,239
there as far as medical and wreck in how

1704
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,038
many states are legal yeah I agree

1705
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,919
there's uh there's definitely not a lot

1706
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:25,079
out there like it that's for sure so if

1707
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,760
someone's young and they're coming in

1708
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:28,680
the industry what's the the best way for

1709
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,319
them to get started in your opinion best

1710
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:33,078
way to get started uh you know without

1711
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,038
any experience at all no hom grow

1712
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:37,039
experience or you know any kind of

1713
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,440
relevant transferable skills like uh you

1714
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,799
know working in a kitchen I would uh

1715
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,639
either you know try to apply for an

1716
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,280
entry-level job with a with a company

1717
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,838
that has a good reputation for having a

1718
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,039
positive working culture and they you

1719
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:51,358
know compensate and take care of their

1720
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:53,480
employees fairly and well that route or

1721
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,880
alternatively going in uh one of those

1722
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,199
different programs they offer you know

1723
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,280
Oaker Dam or uh Cleveland School of

1724
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:01,318
canibas I know both of them work at with

1725
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,119

very established and have a great

1731
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,318

1737
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,760

1738
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:25,599
big fan of culinary schools but I do

1739
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,760
like xer Dam I just taught my first

1740
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,680
class to Oaker Dam a month and a half

1741
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,400
ago or something like that and uh yeah

1742
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:35,038
and we're going to be doing a breeding

1743
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,838
course through Oaker Dam eventually here

1744
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:39,799

1745
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:41,038

people that are doing the Lord's work I

1754
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:57,038
feel like they're really passionate

1755
01:00:55,239 --> 01:01:00,118
about the plant and passionate about

1756
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:02,880
education and finding a way to make the

1757
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:05,280
world a better place and so we need

1758

okay so let's talk about the genetics

1762
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,358
section of your book since I'm a breeder

1763
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:19,318
I do I work with genetics I think your

1764
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:22,000
genetics section is great I feel like

1765
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:24,318
it's a good overview you go into uh

1766
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,239
phenotypes and genotypes a little bit

1767
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,038
how do you feel about the genetic

1768
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:29,679
section of your book who's really one of

1769
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:32,559
the funnest parts of the book to write

1770
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,000
you know just trying to put a foundation

1771
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,720
for people to have a good understanding

1772
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,400
of why it's so important how it came

1773
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:39,719
about what to look for yeah you know

1774
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,079
it's like I said before it's the

1775
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:42,439
backbone of you know every good

1776
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:44,359
successful cannabis cultivation

1777
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,079
operation so yeah it's everything's

1778
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:49,199
built on genetics that's our our slogan

1779
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:50,359
is everything has a beginning genetics

1780
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,798
are so

1781
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:55,239
foundational uh to what you do and I

1782
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,599
feel like it it could not only could it

1783
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:59,358
will make the difference between great

1784
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,400
and good flour and you can't have good

1785
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,880
flour and be successful anymore you know

1786
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,240
10 years ago you could have mediocre or

1787
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,720
good flour and you would still be able

1788
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:11,558
to sell it for a good price and still be

1789
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:14,318
able to make money whereas now you're in

1790
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:16,760
with the stuff that nobody wants that

1791
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,440
they won't pay a lot for and you're

1792
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,839
competing for price with people that can

1793
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,519
produce it for a lot

1794
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:26,480
less so and as far as genetics what are

1795
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,880
you looking for in a good

1796
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,440
our yeah something uh commercially

1797
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,400
viable you know it's got to check all

1798
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,599
the boxes for uh you know not just yield

1799
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,440
quality bag appeal you know from a

1800
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,798
Grower's perspective is it something

1801
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,200
that's easy to work with is it something

1802
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,199
that we have issues with in the Clone

1803
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:44,318
room you know issues with it anywhere is

1804
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:46,719
it pest resistant is it you know disease

1805
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,679
and pathogen free yeah I mean going into

1806
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:50,959
commercial viability I think commercial

1807
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:52,480
viability these days is extremely

1808
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,199
important especially with the business

1809
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,119
and its scale uh but as far as like like

1810
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:59,879
bud structure where are you like nested

1811
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:02,400
bracks you like open bracks you have a

1812
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,440
preference on that yeah I mean I like to

1813
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,960
have open bracks right because when

1814
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,880
you're growing you know thousands of

1815
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,278
plants in a single room yeah you don't

1816
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,278
want to have things too too close

1817
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:13,798
together I mean I don't mind tight buds

1818
01:03:12,278 --> 01:03:15,559
for some stuff but I like my buds to

1819
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:17,960
have shape you know at the end of the

1820
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:20,920
day too and I feel like trimming those

1821
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,679
it's low Leaf to Bud ratio is super

1822
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,039
important I think trimming being able to

1823
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:26,879
trim the weed fast if you grow it proper

1824
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,640
and then as far as trimming what do you

1825
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,798
guys do for trimming do you guys use

1826
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:34,358
traditional scissors are you guys doing

1827
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:36,639
any advanced stuff mechanical separation

1828
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:38,038
or we do a combination of things so we

1829
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,480
have some uh some tumblers some

1830
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:42,359
Terminator XL dries which uh certain

1831
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,639
strains we can push through and it

1832
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:46,880
doesn't look any different from a

1833
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,358
handrim flower there's other things that

1834
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,480
uh you know break up a bit easier and

1835
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:52,639
for those well you know old hand trim

1836
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,400
those yeah I'm I'm a big fan of the

1837
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:58,239
canab brush so and finger trimming I

1838
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,680
think that there still uh places and

1839
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:02,000
applications that work really well even

1840
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:03,519
though it's not generally used by

1841
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,920
everybody but I think the can of brush

1842
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:06,920
and finger trimming is a great way to go

1843
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,200
if you can do it but that's another

1844
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,760
controlled environment you got to be

1845
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:12,118
able to go around 6060 let's talk about

1846
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,200
cloning for a little

1847
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:18,200
bit what do you feel are the best ways

1848
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:20,759
to execute cloning um and the important

1849
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:23,719
things to watch out for uh you know

1850
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,720
starting off with good robust vigorously

1851
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:27,038
growing healthy mother plants yeah you

1852
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:29,519
you know obviously having good genetics

1853
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,960
goes without saying uh keeping things as

1854
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,599
clean as possible you know starting off

1855
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,278
with something like rock wool that has a

1856
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:40,880
good you know oxygen to U water ratio

1857
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:42,719
with inside within the the stone wool uh

1858
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,920
using a good rooting

1859
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,118
hormone uh maintaining the right light

1860
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,519
levels you know what do you consider a

1861
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,838
good root hormone uh the the rooting

1862
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:54,519
hormone is is there ones that you prefer

1863
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:57,558
over other ones yes I use uh I use

1864
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:59,719
clonex IBA the endo3 betra acid you get

1865
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:01,680
a high five for I'm all big on clonex I

1866
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:04,838
use clonex too but I do like hormex as

1867
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,159
well okay uh for for different scenarios

1868
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:08,119
but if you're trying to get really fast

1869
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:10,480
Roots hormex is great clonex is the most

1870
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:12,039
consistent yeah I agree I've been using

1871
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,400
them for you know almost 10 years now

1872
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:16,520
and yep grodan Stonewall with clonex

1873
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,079
great combo works really well together

1874
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:22,239
it does it does how about domes and

1875
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:24,519
humidity and temperature humidity domes

1876
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:26,038
with vents you know typically it'll

1877
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:28,599
start hardening off around like day

1878
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:30,200
three you go like open them a third open

1879
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:32,160
a little more each day start burping

1880
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:34,679
whole trays for like 30 minutes or until

1881
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,159
a sign of wil after like day 8 yeah

1882
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:38,879
should have uh you know fully rooted

1883
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,798
trays day 14 completely hardened off

1884
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,278
temperature- wise humidity wise you want

1885
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:46,480
like you know 7580 inside the Dome have

1886
01:05:43,278 --> 01:05:50,559
a room that's at least like 65 and then

1887
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:52,838
uh temperature you know 77 78 degrees

1888
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,720
Yeah we push ours a little warmer and

1889
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:57,880
but everybody's got their own Tech and

1890
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,959
then maybe like uh 100 150 micro moles

1891
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,160
yeah right there you don't want to push

1892
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,039
them too high no you can get away with a

1893
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:04,558
lot less too and get great results but

1894
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,680
totally yeah I mean we're actually

1895
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:10,200
testing uh mats right now heat mats to

1896
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:13,318
see if we can get more roots or faster

1897
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:16,358
Roots um just as my partner believes my

1898
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:17,960
my TC partner Justin we'll have a future

1899
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:20,199
episode where we discuss if the heat

1900
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,960
mats actually worked but uh he wants to

1901
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:25,078
do trials he claims that they'll root

1902
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,559
faster they're better uh I'm open to it

1903
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:28,240
I want to see the side by side we're

1904
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,559
going to do side by side racks and

1905
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:34,959
really compare cultivar to cultivar heat

1906
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:36,240
mat no heat mat uh and yeah we'll see

1907
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,480
those are like some of the things I love

1908
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,719
doing with AB testing yeah love it man

1909
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,400
gota always always be traling things

1910
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:46,239
figure out uh best practices right yeah

1911
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,798
for sure well and never never rest on

1912
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:49,879
your laurels and expect that what you

1913
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:51,199
have is the best that you can ever get

1914
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,880
oh never I mean that's how we go to

1915
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,159
these these conferences you know totally

1916
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,039
everyone yeah there's so many and

1917
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:58,440
especially the size of mjbiz there's

1918
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,319
always someone who's got something new

1919
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,960
something Innovative I mean I'm looking

1920
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:05,358
for a new rolling machine this year that

1921
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,720
can provide me with a partial hand roll

1922
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:07,798
where we can at least get the shape or

1923
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:10,480
something like that to speed up the

1924
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:13,358
process because I really want a hand

1925
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,278
handrolled joint but I want to be able

1926
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:18,278
to automate part of the process or speed

1927
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:21,039
up the the process if we can to where we

1928
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:22,880
can get something quality but as as I've

1929
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,839
seen so far there's nothing that beats a

1930
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,000
handrolled joint that's 100% handrolled

1931
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:29,519
no I agree a lot of the uh the Packers

1932
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,719
that they have now there's you know

1933
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:33,119
always something wrong with them even if

1934
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,959
it's a small amount of them at a out of

1935
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,838
a large batch you know one a run yeah

1936
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,960
yeah that won't happen with a good

1937
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:40,078
handroll yeah it won't and consistency

1938
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,240
is so important especially with a

1939
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:42,519
product like that that's going out to

1940
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:43,919
the market you can ruin someone's

1941
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:45,559
experience if they get a big old run

1942
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,639
halfway down their joint that's the

1943
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:48,480
experience I want to share with the

1944
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:50,838
world is like the experience that I get

1945
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,838
from smoking if I can share that with

1946
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:54,960
everybody I feel like more people would

1947
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:57,278
smoke you know especially when it tastes

1948
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,358
good it Burns right you get the effect

1949
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:03,199
you get the the experience it's all

1950
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:04,400
about the flavor and the experience yeah

1951
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,159
well and then that makes you want to go

1952
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,798
back for that experience again you know

1953
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:09,239
just like if you're cooking a good meal

1954
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:10,798
and it's it's great they want to come

1955
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:13,159
back and they expect to get a great meal

1956
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:15,400

1957
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:19,719
