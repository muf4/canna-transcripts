55
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,719
some mushrooms with the best friend of

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,958

58
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,239
experience um went to a concert danc

00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,000
like it was

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,319
1992 and he was just like you know I I

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,479
remember like you grew weed in the 90s I

62
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:28,119
was like I did like I bet you gr

63
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,639
mushrooms so it was like a dare yeah I

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,759
was like take that challenge all right

65
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:38,559
so I read I studied micology for a year

66
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,598
and then finally did it and um then the

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,640
pandemic hit and up until that point I'd

68
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,039
been working um for billionaires as a

69
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:50,919
newborn care specialist in private Chef

70
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,799
oh wow so that work kind of died right

71
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,439
in that moment even the wealthiest of

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,519
the wealthy were not having anybody in

73
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,719
their homes right so I was like well I

74
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,400
just learned the skill of growing

75
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:04,799
mushrooms let me let's do this

76
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,200
and um one of the ladies that I was

77
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,439
working with she's um one of the

78
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,039
original Black Panthers and she said you

79
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,318
know your medicine is the cleanest

80
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,519
medicine I've come across in Oakland wow

81
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,958
you what a great time to be in Oakland

82
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,599
you know cuz they had decriminalized

83
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,479
mushrooms yes and psychedelics uh most

84
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:26,719
psychedelics um not most but selective

85
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,000
ones and um she was like I'm going to

86
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,158
take you into the streets of Oakland and

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,598
we're going to get this medicine out

88
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,120
there so she took me into debast Oakland

89
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,359
I'd never been out that far wow and

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,438
started doing

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,640
sashes yes and it just bloomed from

92
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:44,158
there it was just a word of mouth spread

93
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,639
around the country I was going to

94
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:50,239
national conferences letting people know

95
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,839
that um you know the benefits of

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,799
psilocybin and the healing properties

97
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,319
right and um so many people came back to

98
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,120
me with the Positive immediate results

99
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,679
of their use of psilocybin and I started

100
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,039
doing more research and I realized this

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
is something that's going to be

102
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,878
transformative for everybody and it

103
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,479
shouldn't be relegated to just a select

104
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:15,598
few people that can afford it yeah and

105
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:19,680
so that's when I started to think about

106
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:22,399
paths to getting medicine to people and

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,800
um doing it in a legal way in a way that

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,918
um celebrates the medicine and a church

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,478
seems like the best path totally so it's

110
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,079
a community space

111
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,079
it's a space where people can come and

112
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:39,198
get education celebrate the medicine

113
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:42,359
find Spiritual Awakening and in an

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,240
autonomous way yeah that's beautiful

115
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,639
yeah I'm a big proponent of psychedelics

116
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,439
I actually took psychedelics before I

117
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,038
smoked cannabis I was afraid of cannabis

118
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,478
when I was 14 but there is this little

119
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:58,000
paper in my friend ad them they said you

120
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:00,560
know the Ki it was LSD right and these

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,600
little tabs uh

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,879
and I'd done that probably 10 times

123
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,160
before I smoked and I'm like that's an

124
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,360
opposite way such the opposite of most

125
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,360
people uh I was running cross country I

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,680
was worried about my lungs okay and

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,120
smoke okay and I was I mean I guess I

128
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,120
wasn't that smart as a kid but uh you

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,959
know I tried different things and uh

130
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,680
that was definitely like the the

131
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,918
psychedelics opened me up to everything

132
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,800
else uh and the possibilities of other

133
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,159
stuff and I just it's an amazing thing

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,280
and I think used correctly it can be a

135
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,000
life-changing experience and siloc cybin

136
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,399
and the thing is is especially siloc

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,399
cybin and LSD and some of these other uh

138
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,519
compounds I feel like it's

139
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,159
transformative right away like you get

140
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,198
direct effect that can be life-changing

141
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
once you go there you can never go back

142
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,240
right and I think that can be a really

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
amazing thing especially fear and

144
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
anxiety and some of the things that you

145
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,800
can get over with it uh 100% especially

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,079
with people with s depression yeah um

147
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,639
I've had multiple people come to me and

148
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,918
just cry at the table and like you saved

149
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,120
my life like I literally wanted to die

150
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,959
that day and someone gave me some of

151
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,160
your capsules and It reversed my entire

152
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,638
way of thinking yeah and when you have

153
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,120
something that transformative and that

154
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,240
immediate um there are so many people I

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,639
mean we see it here in the streets of

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,439
Oakland every day the level of

157
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,800
desperation um the lack of mental health

158
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,399
treatment for a lot of people how can

159
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,520
you look at that and just turn your head

160
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,799
and when you come to the realization

161
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,799
that soloc cybin is something that's

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,960
going to heal a lot of people why would

163
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,680
you deny that absolutely I mean I feel

164
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:54,279
like it was just like you know all this

165
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,360
stuff we even CBD was kind of looked at

166
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,000
negatively uhuh you know until sanj

167
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,919
Gupta came up and said look these kids

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
are getting cured but for for instance

169
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,959
mushrooms I have a friend he has severe

170
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,160
migraines and the only cure is

171
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,359
psilocybin mushrooms right literally the

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
only cure and he has to take a pretty

173
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,919
big dose but he he does it he he

174
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,680
actually knows how to regulate it so

175
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:16,000
when it's coming on he takes it before

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,160
it hits him hard and then he doesn't get

177
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,240
the severe migraines and how can you say

178
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,160
that's wrong you know that's that's my

179
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,759
big argument is how can you say that

180
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,599
somebody's Health shouldn't be in their

181
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,400
own hands if it's not hurting anybody

182
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:30,878
else right and it's beneficial how can

183
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,239
you say that's bad right right right and

184
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,919
there's studies that now I mean from ivy

185
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,598
league institutions and other reputable

186
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,240
universities around the world that it

187
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,878
regenerates neuron growth and so we live

188
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,960
in like this fear-based culture of like

189
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,400
don't you know don't hurt yourself by

190
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,519
doing just anything anything can do that

191
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,878
so finding out that psilocybin reverses

192
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,839
it and actually um regenerates neuron

193
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,520
growth it's huge it's huge for people

194
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:04,038
with um CTE and NFL ERS with brain

195
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,878
damage right um people with Alzheimer's

196
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,240
people with postpartum depression people

197
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960
with you know I mean it and we're just

198
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,800
scratching the surface no I mean then

199
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,918
that's the thing it's like it's it's

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,319
incredible like we still have so much to

201
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:20,918
learn y there's so much potential for it

202
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,000
and so what we do know is that it helps

203
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,959
people with addictions and it helps

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,279
people with um depression and that's the

205
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,758
main thing that we're dealing with in

206
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,758
the United States right now right so

207
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,320
well we live in a fear-based society and

208
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,519
I think a lot of religions are uh

209
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,399
founded around fear and uh unfortunately

210
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,038
right and so we live in this fear-based

211
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,879
society that you got to be AF you should

212
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,720
be afraid of stuff and you should be

213
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,759
Afra you know I think well D Western

214
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,000
Western religions Western religion yeah

215
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,519
for sure Western

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,200
religions um unfortunately yeah and so

217
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,679
and I don't think all of those religions

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,480
were founded and meant to be like that I

219
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,359
think that it evolved to be like that

220
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,759
over time mhm cuz it's a control

221
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,360
mechanism it's a control mechanism for

222
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,559
the masses right and the same with you

223
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,839
know government control over plant

224
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,359
medicine period yeah because they want

225
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,920
to push their own agenda right and so

226
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:22,120
they they ins still fear into people

227
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:24,360
fear for profit right 100% And so I've

228
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,120
made it my mission to create this safe

229
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:32,320
space where um I don't push an agenda I

230
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,919
don't push um a

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,040
Dogma um I'm not um pushing a specific

232
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:42,159
you know philosophy um it's a space

233
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,838
where people can come and find their own

234
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:49,000
spiritual path where they can find their

235
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,760
own um healing uh we just provide the

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,360
cleanest medicine for you to do that and

237
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,319
we also have Avenues if you're looking

238
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,959
for a therapist or if you're looking for

239
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
um a ceremony I I love the fact that

240
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,199
it's self exploration right at the end

241
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,359
of the day we all need to explore what

242
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,040
works for us because our body

243
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,399
chemistries are so uniquely different

244
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,319
and I feel like there's no one-sized

245
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,000
fits-all solution for any of our

246
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,760
problems because we're all so uniquely

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,879
different and it's beautiful if you can

248
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,919
go and start exploring what works for

249
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,600
you and find you know finding out what

250
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,719
doesn't work is a great way to find out

251
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,680
what works process of

252
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,160
elimination but with that you have to be

253
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,000
careful too extremely careful but that's

254
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,000
why you know having a guide or having

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,240
somebody who can help help show you the

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,679
way and you know I think micro do is now

257
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,680
a thing and when I was a kid there was

258
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,919
no micro do we used to eat e of

259
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,078
mushrooms pretty regularly yeah and

260
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,519
quarters of yeah the most it was a

261
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,000
quarter when I was a kid we didn't weigh

262
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,120
it we just picked them and made tea and

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,759
drank it or we just eat it right out out

264
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,159
Forest tea I I like tea the best though

265
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,600
for me personally I like the tea because

266
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,039
it doesn't mess up my stomach as much

267
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,120
whereas if certain types of mushrooms

268
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,000
really mess my stomach but I like

269
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,480
mushrooms for public speaking believe it

270
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,759
or not I think it's a great way you know

271
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,039
I've done micro do and I've done a

272
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,559
little bit more than micro do and I

273
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,480
learned that you know you got to tone it

274
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,599
back um I got a little religious at MJ

275
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,600
Biz one the time talking so well you

276
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,519
know I get really excited about stuff

277
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,040
but what I like about psychedelics is

278
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,440
specifically mushrooms for public

279
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,319
speaking is I don't have to use memory

280
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,680
recall uh that goes away and I start

281
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,639
talking from the heart where it just

282
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,319
flows and I'm able to get my point

283
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,000
across and I'm not really thinking or

284
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,040
trying to process what I should say next

285
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,679
I'm just saying it right it's like a

286
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:40,078
very clear stream of Consciousness where

287
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,278
it's not um disconnected it just kind of

288
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,439
flows well and then I feel like it comes

289
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:46,720
across as more authentic and so some of

290
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,160
these shows I take micro does some of

291
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,160
them I don't it just depends on the

292
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,639
individual show right so and I love that

293
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,078
and that's you know the self-exploration

294
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,200
side where I'm like exploring what works

295
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,519
for me and what doesn't and there's so

296
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,360
many compounds now before we had like

297
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,679
three or four right and now there's 50

298
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,759
yeah yeah so yeah it's we're in a

299
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,919
beautiful time we are I mean we really

300
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:13,720
are and I think um with the church and

301
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:17,639
allowing people to keep that control

302
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,440
within the individual is so important

303
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,680
it's it's sacred that you have your own

304
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,320
ability to choose your own path of

305
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,559
healing and the mode of and speed that

306
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,440
you want to do it yeah as is so

307
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,799
important um I don't really agree with

308
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,360
the

309
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:40,399
um the therapeutic like the the the

310
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,039
whole model of people sitting in a room

311
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,679
with eye masks on and a blanket and

312
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,120
holding the hand of a therapist um that

313
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,039
to me

314
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,839
is isolating and also borderline in

315
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:58,198
appropriate in my opinion um I I can't

316
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,199
think of a time in my personal

317
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:03,919
experience in therapist office where

318
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,759
anyone would ever touch you so I don't

319
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,078
see how that is appropriate especially

320
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,519
when someone's under the influence and

321
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,838
you've opened someone's mind completely

322
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,839
right if they're going to do it certain

323
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,440
ways and there has to be very strict

324
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,399
protocols and um unfortunately I think

325
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,000
they kind of failed on that aspect yeah

326
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,078
um they don't even do background checks

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,919
on people wow I spoke at a at a

328
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,239
conference and

329
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,240
they didn't even

330
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,399
know where you would look for somebody

331
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,198
that's like where you would look up

332
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,240
someone's name that was sex offender and

333
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:42,719
I'm like that's okay well and it's

334
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,600
because it's been gray area and it's not

335
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,120
accepted by the masses I mean it's

336
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,399
starting to be right I think there's

337
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,639
been you know it's Leaps and Bounds from

338
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,399
where it used to be you know and and

339
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,519
same thing with cannabis cannabis was

340
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,559
very much against the ma the majority of

341
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,159
people were against cannabis right and

342
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,719
now than 50% I think it's closer to 70%

343
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,879
now or Pro cannabis especially for

344
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,600
medical use and I think Dennis prone

345
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,198
said it's medical whether you believe in

346
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,800
it or not but I feel like psychedelics

347
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,198
are the same way like they can be

348
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,719
therapeutic and and medically beneficial

349
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,159
especially you know for your psyche

350
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,278
right right right just for your whole

351
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,679
feeling of connectedness to the world

352
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:29,720
and and Trauma right we have so as we

353
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,758
you know we talk about filters I talk

354
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,800
about this on my show quite often but

355
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,039
the filters that go over from every

356
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,198
experience you have you have a filter

357
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,559
that goes over your eyes and that's how

358
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,599
you see the world from the time you're

359
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,919
born you develop these filters and it's

360
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,920
great to take some of those filters off

361
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,319
and see the world how it really is again

362
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,559
right and that's almost the only way I

363
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,600
think there's you know meditation and

364
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,958
there's Buddhist monks were you know

365
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,240
they were able to tap in to their inner

366
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,319
DMT too right right right so but I think

367
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,879
that stuff it's it's amazing and I feel

368
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,800
like it's gaining momentum the fact that

369
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,600
it's decriminalized in several States or

370
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,359
places uh cities I guess more than

371
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,639
States but it's going in the right

372
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,680
direction oh it is absolutely I mean

373
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,560
when you have um articles in Vanity Fair

374
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,679
and you have mothers talking about

375
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,879
starting Market Rosen groups in the

376
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,719
midwest I mean you've kind of touched

377
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,000
the spots that really needed it's

378
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,759
spreading it's spreading really quickly

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,039
when people take it and they realize

380
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,240
that they're not going to be tripping

381
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:33,039
out that it's actually like um it's

382
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,959
almost like a what how I describe it is

383
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,039
like a natural volume yeah without the

384
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,198
fogginess without saying yes to

385
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:43,719
everything you're just calm and you're

386
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:46,958
in a place of Zen and you can navigate

387
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,199
the world from a place of just more um

388
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,239
grounded thinking and just

389
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,039
feeling yeah I think the awareness

390
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,560
aspect of it is so

391
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,159
amazing U because a lot of us aren't

392
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:58,518
aware and we're not living in the moment

393
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,039
either and I kind of feel like a lot of

394
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,519
us either live in the past or they live

395
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:05,639
in the future or both at different

396
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,759
moments in time and with psychedelics

397
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,240
you can really go into the moment

398
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,680
without even having to think about it

399
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,120
you're in the moment right you know

400
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,679
we're all in the moment all the time but

401
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,198
to put us there

402
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:20,399
mentally uh it's an amazing thing and

403
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:24,399
for a lot of people it's a big breath of

404
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,480
relief yeah yeah yeah and that's that's

405
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,278
that's kind of the the danger with it I

406
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,000
won't say danger but things that we need

407
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,399
to be cognizant of is that you shouldn't

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,360
be using psychedelics as just an escape

409
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:42,720
from your current sit current reality um

410
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,639
it should be used in a way that um opens

411
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,120
you up and so that when you do come back

412
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,959
to reality you have a better

413
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,600
understanding of it yeah and um I do see

414
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,119
some people in the community that use it

415
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,040
as a way of escape and um I don't

416
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,360
necessarily agree with that but at the

417
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,519
same time like I don't judge people and

418
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,038
I don't dictate how people use it right

419
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,720
um because everyone has their own path

420
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,078
yeah we all make mistakes and we

421
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,798
hopefully learn from them you know I

422
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,240
think that's the beauty of life too is

423
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:16,798
like making mistakes so you can learn

424
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,480
from them and the beauty of psychedelics

425
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,279
especially like mushrooms is it's a lot

426
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,000
safer than even cannabis to where you

427
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,359
can take a heavy dose and you can feel

428
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,400
pretty scared but you're going to be

429
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,558
okay yeah yeah and and there's no level

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,200
of addiction to it none um and once

431
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,279
you've done a heavy toast you know that

432
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,440
there's no level of addiction you know

433
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,558
it's like that's all you need is one

434
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:44,600
good heavy do yeah true during Co I was

435
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:45,480
with Marlon and we ate 16 grams of some

436
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:48,480
golden

437
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,759
teachers that's a lot I don't recommend

438
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
that and I don't recommend that to

439
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,599
anybody either and and Marlin is a yeah

440
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,640
he's a mushroom

441
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,558
connoisseur and we had maybe was over 16

442
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,159
Gams it might have been 17 or 18 but

443
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,759
either way it was it was a still it

444
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:06,240
still Beyond a heroic do yeah and it was

445
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:10,359
over a period of a good amount of time

446
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,759
and we were at like the worst ree show

447
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:14,038
that I felt so bad and he we started

448
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,558
eating mushrooms then we mov back to the

449
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,759
house and uh we hung out and we were

450
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,119
laughing so hard but we we put on TV and

451
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,839
the first thing that came on was UFC and

452
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,519
both of us looked at each other like no

453
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,798
we can't watch this this has to go and

454
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,319
so we were trying to like we were

455
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:30,519
probably spent like minutes trying to

456
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,319
find something to watch and I'm like

457
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,558
Disney has to have something that we can

458
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,519
watch and we stumbled on this show

459
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,639
called pickle and peanut and pickle and

460
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,440
peanut was designed and must have been

461
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,759
written by somebody who uses lots of

462
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,240
psychedelics Na weed definitely

463
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,279
psychedelics they incorporate animation

464
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,038
with like a live video of like animals

465
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,918
and people and and we laughed so hard we

466
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:57,798
probably laugh for four or five hours

467
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
straight I believe it where I would look

468
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:01,240
at him and I would start laughing and

469
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,798
then he would start laughing and then I

470
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,079
try to stop laughing but he was laughing

471
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,960
so I couldn't stop and both of us just

472
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,639
we were on the floor and literally my

473
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,519
stomach hurt and my cheeks hurt from

474
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,880
laughing so hard and then I had a

475
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,759
hangover the next day from it and you

476
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,799
can get hangovers from psychedelics from

477
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,759
from mushrooms if you eat too much you

478
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:22,558
have physical feelings of just like you

479
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,079
did a thousand crunches yeah like you

480
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:29,200
probably did you know in that same

481
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:30,759
notion you probably did equivalent to

482
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,919
so but those are good experiences

483
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,079
they're fun stories and yeah you know

484
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,440
and it's like it's not like alcohol you

485
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,199
drink too much alcohol you're in the

486
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,320
hospital you could die right right so

487
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,880
the worst thing that happens usually I

488
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:45,359
mean you see God and some aliens yeah

489
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,559
you see God and some aliens hopefully

490
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,079
you don't take your clothes off and run

491
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,558
naked through the streets but that I

492
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,558
don't find that to be the case with

493
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:56,240
mushrooms with most LSD LSD yeah

494
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,119
possibility I've seen it happen with

495
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,880
mushrooms once okay but usually it's the

496
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,158
LSD and I think it was a combination of

497
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,159
mushrooms at alcohol that maybe had you

498
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,640
know pushed somebody over the limit one

499
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,280
of my friends when we were younger yeah

500
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,679
but yeah there's always great stories

501
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:15,119
about people on psychedelics and yeah so

502
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,360
yeah I I just I think there're such an

503
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,519
amazing thing and I wish everybody had

504
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,479
the opportunity in their life to

505
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:25,240
experience them yeah so um I it's not

506
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,839
for everybody though you're right it's

507
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,798
not for everybody it's not um like if if

508
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,558
you

509
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,119
have been diagnosed with schizophrenia

510
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:34,399
or if your family like one of your

511
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,279
immediate family members has

512
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,840
schizophrenia yeah you should never do

513
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,279
psilocybin um because if you don't have

514
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,639
the symptoms of it and you do psilocybin

515
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,759
it could trigger that well I think

516
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,000
cannabis can also do that I'm not sure

517
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:51,919
about that but yeah I think cannabis so

518
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,240
yeah I mean there's there's a you know I

519
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,640
think there's something for everybody

520
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,558
and maybe it's not psychedelics for

521
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,480
everybody and maybe marijuana can't

522
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,839
cannabis isn't for everybody either

523
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,599
right but the fact is that there's only

524
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:09,759
a few people that can't do that I mean

525
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:12,240
yeah schizophrenia um

526
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,720
epilepsy and um high blood pressure

527
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,359
diabetes yeah and everyone that that

528
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,200
leaves a wide range of other people that

529
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,319
can do it and should yeah and people

530
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,798
that have had trauma it's a great way to

531
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:26,158
see if it can help with your trauma I

532
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:28,599
think it's you know yeah I agree I agree

533
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,520
under certain circumstances yes um

534
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,000
directly after a traumatic experience

535
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,679
probably not the best no I mean

536
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,319
childhood trauma it's good I think

537
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,919
childhood trauma is good and we all have

538
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:38,639
childhood trauma everybody does you

539
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,200
don't think you have childhood trauma

540
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,720
you're probably wrong yeah you do you

541
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,080
know there's very few people I know that

542
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,839
don't I mean I don't know anybody

543
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,319
actually that doesn't have some form of

544
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,918
childhood trauma right right right and

545
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:53,798
everyone's um idea of what is traumatic

546
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,200
is different so um I don't think you can

547
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:59,440
you can judge like oh your trauma wasn't

548
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,400
as as you know severe as mine whatever

549
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,679
it's all individual and I think that

550
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,960
soloc Simon is super healing on whatever

551
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,600
range of trauma it is yeah so do you

552
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,000
guys do any form of like me mesculin or

553
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:16,558
anything else like Cactus uh no we don't

554
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,119
um s Pedro those who we do have it from

555
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,480
time to time like we do have vendors

556
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:24,639
that come through that do have um cacti

557
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,120
plant medicine but um it's not something

558
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,520
that we regularly offer there yeah yeah

559
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:34,119
I'm a big fan of all of

560
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:36,319
it sounds like it yeah I mean I know my

561
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,119
stuff to a degree but I I just I enjoy

562
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,599
it and the thing is is when I saw the

563
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:44,678
legal pathway for uh

564
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,558
cybin coming down I I had friends that

565
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,120
are like you should breed cybin because

566
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,200
you know you can you can do breeding and

567
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,959
selection to a degree with cybin and I

568
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,600
said no thank you that's not my thing

569
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
that's my thing I'm I'm a cannabis guy

570
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,639
I've been fighting for cannabis my whole

571
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,159
life right and believing in the plant

572
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,120
and I believe that that's my plant uh

573
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,760
and I love being on the sidelines and

574
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,038
watching all my other friends win and

575
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,640
you know all seeing the trials and

576
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,798
tribulations going on because it's not

577
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,320
easy it's not as easy as people thought

578
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:16,079
in the beginning I saw a lot of people

579
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,798
dive in invest a lot of money lose a lot

580
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,079
of

581
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,400
money and I'm just excited being on the

582
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,399
sidelines and being able to try these

583
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,038
things so now there's like mushroom

584
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,600
gummies there was never mushroom gummies

585
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:27,720
growing up we had like maybe mushroom

586
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,599
chocolate somebody would make some

587
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,480
chocolates out of in there or they

588
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:37,079
ground up you know and but the level

589
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,319
of uh quality is just amazing how far

590
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,918
it's come and the different varieties of

591
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:44,798
stuff that you can get I mean I think

592
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,640
they have sprays now they have uh yeah

593
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:51,079
sublingual they have gummies they have

594
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,360
chocolate they have all kinds of stuff

595
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,158
and you name it they probably got it you

596
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,240
know as far as whatever you can think of

597
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,080
just like cannabis edals I haven't seen

598
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,798
a beverage yet but I bet it's either

599
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,038
coming or it's already there's a

600
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,679
beverage already yeah yeah yeah we have

601
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,759
a beverage at our at our location I know

602
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,798
where I'm coming

603
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,079
from it's a powder drink but yeah yeah

604
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,519
is it in the cap and then you we it

605
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,759
comes in two tubes and then you mix it

606
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,918
oh nice yeah really

607
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,240
cool yeah and I I love it because I feel

608
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,200
like eating mushrooms is it for

609
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,120
everybody because it's like cardboard

610
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,278
and sunflower seeds that's that's how I

611
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,678
describe eating Act ual dry mushrooms M

612
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:33,119
uh some of them taste shitty some of

613
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,200
them don't but like they shouldn't taste

614
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,278
shitty they

615
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,720
shouldn't some of them back in the when

616
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,319
I was a kid did there was actual on

617
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,399
it there was actual they were

618
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,359
pulled out of out of cow manure

619
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:48,558
specifically right right but yeah I

620
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,479
think that uh it's amazing because

621
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,639
people are more inclined to try stuff if

622
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,720
it's a gummy or if it's you know

623
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,080
something appealing

624
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,679
right cand taste good like they they do

625
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,960
not tast to very few people they're like

626
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,399
this I like the taste of it but

627
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,759
typically people are like I don't want

628
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:07,639
to go sit and eat a bunch of dried

629
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,720
mushrooms rather drink tea like if I was

630
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,600
going to do it that way and I feel like

631
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,600
tea is the one that hits you right away

632
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:16,079
it's the most effective in my opinion

633
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,959
but yeah there's the chocolates are good

634
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,918
too I like chocolate I think that the

635
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,399
interesting thing between now and 20

636
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,000
years ago for me with mushrooms

637
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,239
especially is I used to get stomach

638
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,519
aches from it and I had this thing where

639
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,599
I'd eat green M&amp;M's and so so

640
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,879
psychologically the green you know they

641
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,879
have very little actual chocolate in

642
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,799
M&amp;M's but psychologically they were very

643
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,880
helpful and uh yeah I really liked uh

644
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,480
green M&amp;M's with stuff now a lot of the

645
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,120
stuff doesn't give me the stomach aches

646
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,440
like it used to um and I think different

647
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:50,319
varieties too it's not the varieties

648
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,080
that give you the stomach ache and this

649
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,079
is something that is really missing from

650
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,119
the

651
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:00,079
Psychedelic uh education right now is

652
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:02,359
food safety huh food safety you should

653
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,759
never be getting sick on mushrooms you

654
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,678
should never be vomiting you should

655
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,158
never have diarrhea it's not iasa you're

656
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,600
not purging right so if you are getting

657
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,520
sick from

658
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:16,398
mushrooms it's because of food poisoning

659
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,839
so I heard some of the ones that like uh

660
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:21,439
the penis envies they they don't have

661
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,959
like they they're open caps and so they

662
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,759
don't have spores spores and so I heard

663
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,640
that the spores are actually what would

664
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,158
cause stomach like I never got like sick

665
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,679
to where I was thrown up typically but

666
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,559
it would give me that twisting in my

667
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,320
stomach and nobody wants to have that

668
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,079
feeling when they're feeling the effects

669
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,759
psychedelics so there's another reason

670
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,798
that it may be as well and there's a

671
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,720
very small subset of people that have an

672
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:47,038
aversion to kiten and kiten is a protein

673
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,600
that's in the mushroom it's also a

674
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,839
protein that's in the exoskeleton of

675
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:56,319
insects and some people find that hard

676
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:58,398
to digest wow and so you for those folks

677
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,439
tea is tea or extract is the only only

678
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,959
way that you're going to be able to do

679
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,038
it without getting a stomach ache um but

680
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,079
it's a very small percentage that have

681
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,000
that aversion it's possible that you

682
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:10,839
have that totally possible but all the

683
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,558
stuff today does none of it gives me

684
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,639
stomach aches then it was food poisoning

685
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:17,158
100% probably food poisoning 100% when

686
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,799
people come to me and they're like oh

687
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,480
man I took this I ate this chocolate bar

688
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,599
and I was vomiting and oh I had the runs

689
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,919
I'm like that's because you ate a really

690
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,199
disgusting chocolate that was not made

691
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,399
properly y um people handle mushrooms if

692
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,759
you see people handling mushrooms with

693
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,158
their hands after handling money after

694
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:39,038
it falling on the floor it's not weed

695
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,000
we're not putting it in a pipe and

696
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,679
burning it you're eating it would you

697
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,519
eat french fries that fell on the floor

698
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,840
no why would you eat mushrooms that fell

699
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,519
on the floor it's the same thing like

700
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,398
then food safety still in for I used to

701
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,159
be Chef as well right so I I think food

702
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,199
safety is so important and a lot of

703
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,960
people look past it and a lot of the

704
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,399
early mushroom things were made by

705
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,720
people in their houses yeah yeah or

706
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:10,000
wherever yeah hotel rooms whatever not

707
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,839
sanitary not sanitary not thinking about

708
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,679
no Health Department no not thinking

709
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,439
about like how you handle the mushrooms

710
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,080
you know you put them in a bag and it's

711
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
rolling around with manure in there and

712
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:23,319
then you take it home and you eat it

713
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:27,080
like yeah you just ate manure like yeah

714
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:29,158
would you you with hand no and

715
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,319
that's another thing is like I I see a

716
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,559
lot of people posting photos of

717
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:36,918
mushrooms dried and they're covered with

718
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,519
brown on the bottom yeah and I'm just

719
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:43,080
like that is unnecessary unnecessary and

720
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,399
it just took day age anyway no I mean

721
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,079
and the knowledge is there it's just

722
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,439
laziness well I think yeah I mean really

723
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,960
what they should be doing is cutting off

724
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,320
the tops baging those and then

725
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,880
extracting what's left in the subst we

726
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,678
cutting it before you dehydrate it it's

727
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,679
one step it's one step but but people

728
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,038
are think thinking too far ahead with um

729
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,840
oh I don't want to lose weight yeah

730
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,558
they're worried with their yields so

731
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,839
they leave it on there and they think oh

732
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,798
I'll brush it after it's dehydrated

733
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:13,199
right number one it's super timec

734
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,759
consuming to do that and the amount of

735
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,440
substrate that you leave on it is

736
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:20,200
negligible yeah so just cut it and

737
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,798
dehydrate it like it doesn't have to be

738
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:27,319
so dirty it's so dirty yeah it's gross

739
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:29,000
it's so gross and then for the um the

740
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:30,720
people who don't know and are consuming

741
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,960
it they're like Oh I thought the brown

742
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,319
stuff was supposed to be there I'm like

743
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,759
no no no I'm like would you take would

744
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,119
you take a salt shaker yeah and and put

745
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,960
that all into a little salt shaker and

746
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,639
sprinkle it on your eggs and eat it no

747
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,720
probably not so then don't eat it off

748
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,640
the bottom of a mushroom yeah it's it's

749
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,720
interesting the world and this is

750
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,440
because we're just in the infancy of

751
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,360
legalization I think a lot yeah you look

752
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,558
at where cannabis is now especially with

753
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,439
packaging and with safety standards in

754
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,599
wreck right and I'm not saying it's

755
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,519
perfect but it's you it's safer than any

756
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,519
other egg product actually it's tested

757
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,720
heavier uh in some ways that's

758
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,319
unfortunate in other ways it's great do

759
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,159
you feel like it's fail proof do you

760
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,599
think stuff slips through the cracks

761
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,360
absolutely stuff slips through the

762
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:20,879
cracks and you can spray stuff that is

763
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,038
not necessarily good uh right even

764
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,440
though it's omry listed does not

765
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,720
necessarily mean it's good especially if

766
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,480
you spray at the end and yeah you might

767
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,000
be able to pass testing but that doesn't

768
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,640
mean you're creating a product that's

769
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,599
still good for people to consume just

770
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,278
because it's omy listed right and I

771
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,678
think people need to get out of that

772
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:39,359
mindset you know and I think there's a

773
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,679
lot of preventative stuff people can do

774
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,319
especially with cannabis that so they

775
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,480
don't have to spray or they have to

776
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,918
spray in a very minimum amount and you

777
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,519
know the less you spray especially if

778
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,360
you're making extract from it the less

779
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:55,480
you spray the better uh so but we we do

780
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,479
have a safe product I think that the

781
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,079
product and I think a lot of people that

782
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,240
were using things like Avid most of

783
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:02,678
those people are gone they don't have

784
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,519
businesses anymore they're I'm not

785
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:08,240
familiar with it at all I grew in 96 to

786
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,159
06 and then I got out so all this new

787
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,240
stuff like I'm just getting

788
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,960
re-educated yeah so there's all kinds of

789
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,120
stuff that you can spray to you know

790
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,558
it's like spraying Roundup on your

791
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:24,518
plants yeah nasty yeah so but you know

792
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:24,519
you can't spray round up on

793
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,638
cannabis thank God you can't put it on

794
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:32,038
mushroom

795
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,000
no no no there's not a lot that you can

796
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:35,558
do because you have to grow in a sterile

797
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,759
environment right so technically you're

798
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:39,278
growing in a sterile environment you

799
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,278
should have a sterile product it doesn't

800
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,440
always happen that way no and then you

801
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,398
get contamination oh everyone gets

802
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,519
contamination you growing mushrooms

803
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,839
you're never going to not have

804
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:53,599
contamination at some point yeah because

805
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,839
all it takes is one molecule of mold mhm

806
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,678
and the whole thing's ruined and I think

807
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,038
a lot of the cannabis FKS that switched

808
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,960
over to mushrooms thought it was going

809
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:06,038
to be so super easy absolutely and it's

810
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,200
like no no it's actually much more

811
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:10,319
complicated yeah and it's labor

812
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,798
intensive believe it or not it's super

813
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:18,678
labor intensive um making the grain

814
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:20,200
harvesting all of it well there's now

815
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,798
there's shops you can buy the grain you

816
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,759
can buy whatever substrate you want

817
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:25,839
there's multiple types of substrate you

818
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,240
can buy them it gets costly if you're

819
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,158
doing it on a regular basis though I bet

820
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,399
I bet it gets I mean and the thing is is

821
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,240
the price of mushrooms

822
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,558
since uh decriminalization has changed a

823
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,159
lot oh yeah it's gone down way down the

824
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,558
market got flooded just like cannabis

825
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:43,519
but I also see like a lot of these

826
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:47,440
commercial varieties and strains of

827
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,880
mushrooms uhuh and I think that I'm very

828
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,480
particular on what I like uhuh uh

829
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,159
especially if I'm making te's I I like

830
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,079
specifically golden teachers in larger

831
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,760
amounts because I always feel so good

832
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:02,119
but like the penis mvy is not my cup of

833
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:05,240
tea not M but it's a very yeah there's a

834
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,839
few there's like some turkey uh these

835
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,440
these big giant ones and it's like

836
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:09,638
they're they're made for yield and I

837
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,000
think they're made for commercial

838
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:14,678
production uhuh and they're as far as

839
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,398
like I'm all about effect with mushrooms

840
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:17,759
at the end of the day it's for me it's

841
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,599
all about effect how does it make me

842
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,599
feel does it make me feel better do I

843
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,038
feel clear do I feel introverted right

844
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,798
because sometimes I'll feel introverted

845
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:28,359
and not social at all and I want to be

846
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,480
alone and not want to talk to people or

847
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,719
like I can't talk to people do you want

848
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,360
to talk to me and I can't like talk

849
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,480
you've taken too much taken too much or

850
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,678
taking the right amount and you're in

851
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,278
the wrong environment exactly that too

852
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,639
that too um there are so many varieties

853
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:46,240
of mushrooms um psilocybin uh there used

854
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:48,240
to be believed that a cube is a cube is

855
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,200
a cube like no matter what it is it's

856
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,240
all just going to give you the same

857
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,880
experience and that's just not the case

858
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,798
no um what I've noticed is that there

859
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,000
are some that are that don't give you

860
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,240
visuals just mod high and you just feel

861
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,599
like Zen just calm right and then there

862
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,200
are other ones that are hyper Visual and

863
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,519
um not social so it's more for like

864
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,480
somebody that's trying to do meditation

865
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,199
and then like penis envy is like natural

866
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,760
LSD it's not for everybody no it's like

867
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,838
uh it's 5x strengthwise three three two

868
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,760
to three yeah yeah I feel like for

869
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:22,639
Golden teachers it's like a 5x oh yeah

870
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,480
no golden teachers is like it's like the

871
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,440
beginners like the training wheel but I

872
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:32,119
just love so for me it's like I like I

873
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,838
like uh Tai cenzi those are great too I

874
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,919
I like those a lot but the golden

875
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:39,119
teachers just always make me feel good

876
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,239
right so like I I go back to that a lot

877
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,079
of times because I love the good feeling

878
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:46,759
and I think the penis EnV is like you

879
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,000
know even though 0.1 micro do doesn't

880
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,679
feel like a micro do it's not it's

881
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,599
genuinely not yeah I I I find it hard to

882
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,720
believe when people are like I'm going

883
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,240
to micro do on penis ENB I'm like that's

884
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,039
just very rare yeah um we have some

885
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,919
gummies from micel Oakland and they were

886
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:07,679
like oh there's 250 milligrams in each

887
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,880
gummy I was like okay I took one and it

888
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,799
was the beginning of a journey I was

889
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,760
like that's not a micro do no that's not

890
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,280
a micro do no and it's like a gram so

891
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,960
like a gram of penis envy feels like an

892
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,040
eighth of a lot of other mushrooms yes

893
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,358
and an eighth of penis envy feels like

894
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,159
the craziest hero You' been taken no

895
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,920
that's like 9 to 12 grams of a regular

896
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:30,118
one yeah I had one guy come to me and I

897
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,760
warned him I warned him I said don't

898
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,440
take more than a gram start there always

899
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,599
start small because you can always take

900
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,320
more you can't take less you can

901
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,519
staircase it but just feel it out his

902
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,400
friends were like no she's just she's

903
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,358
pumping you up like take the whole thing

904
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,039
like it's just like any other mushroom

905
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:53,598
yeah he took the whole 3.5 grams little

906
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,639
get and sat on the couch and they said

907
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,640
the only thing he could say for hours

908
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,078
was the entities the entities that

909
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,199
identities and I'm like well yeah of

910
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,519
course yeah that's that's a lot so he

911
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,960
came back and told me about it and he

912
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,039
said you know it was honestly the most

913
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,599
beautiful experience in my life but

914
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,679
it'll be a while before I do my shs

915
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:12,838
again I was like I don't blame you yeah

916
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,519
I don't blame you at that level well and

917
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,719
so I call it the full melt experience

918
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,318
where like you get it from DMT actually

919
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:21,838
the first time I had it was from nitrous

920
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:23,440
oxide which is very different you know

921
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,920
I've had I've gone down different paths

922
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,960
than a lot of people very different U I

923
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,318
was so in Oakland off 8 there's a

924
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,000
Pottery Shop everybody knows the Pottery

925
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:36,480
Shop well there was a rave back in maybe

926
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,679
90 something uhhuh and someone had a

927
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,800
tank in the VIP room and my friend was

928
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:43,559
the one throwing in the party and so I

929
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,440
got a big punching ball thing of nitrous

930
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:50,199
and there was a big like uh bean bag

931
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,318
chair and I decided to go I was like

932
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:54,960
that looks like a big perfect chair to

933
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:56,920
go sit and suck on this balloon and I'm

934
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,679
not a big nous guy now or anything but I

935
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,480
I did it then and I got this full melt

936
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:04,118
experience and I don't know how long I

937
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,599
was gone just like very DMT very DMT

938
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,760
like don't know how long I was gone I

939
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,280
came back tried to gather all my friends

940
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,079
around because I want to explain

941
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,200
everything because I understood

942
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,960
everything and the second I tried to

943
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,879
start putting it into words I you you

944
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,720
can't

945
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,640
verbalize where you go or what happened

946
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:24,239
but at the end all I could say is we're

947
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,719
all going to be okay and that's stuck

948
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,399
with me through life and that's like one

949
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,759
of those life-changing things where it's

950
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,639
like we're all going to be okay no

951
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,520
matter what whatever happens here

952
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:38,039
whatever happens to us on this plane

953
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,800
we're all going to be okay and that was

954
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,440
my big takeaway and I'm lucky I got that

955
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,800
at a very young age because I've always

956
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,358
felt like you know I've been a up

957
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,400
part of my life and I've done stupid

958
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,719
stuff and I've done a lot of great stuff

959
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,838
but the one takeaway is that we're all

960
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,559
going to be okay yeah yeah and if

961
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,838
everybody felt that way how much better

962
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,400
could the world be it's just I it's it's

963
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:03,318
it's a different mindset you know I

964
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,559
think I felt that in Cuba when I was

965
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:09,838
there m times that it was um a feeling

966
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,519
of just living day by day y because you

967
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,119
didn't have any worries about where your

968
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,920
food's coming from where you're you know

969
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:19,760
it's just very by the day right I've

970
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,280
never experienced that anywhere else

971
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,680
Barcelona is the same way Florence is

972
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,359
too I believe it I believe it yeah my

ingredients they use are just well the

983
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,280
bread in Europe is so different I feel

984
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:51,199
like it agrees with my stomach more like

985
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,319
that's another one I I don't the the the

986
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,838
grain here doesn't agree with me like

987
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:57,759
over in Europe I'm fine but but not here

988
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,599
same with the tomatoes for me yeah I had

989
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,119
acid reflux so bad couldn't eat tomato

990

992
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,000
use a lot of tomatoes in Italy so and

993
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,800
tomatoes are great I I love tomatoes

994

they do even I like growing my own

995
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,119
Tomatoes it's one of my favorite things

996
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:17,159
to grow besides cannabis right

997
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,880
interesting yeah well they and they grow

998
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:21,920
similar in a lot of ways that's what we

999
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,880
used to tell the the hydro stores we

1000
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,480
were growing totally we had to come talk

1001
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,039
about tomatoes tomatoes and they'd be

1002
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,000
like tomatoes right Berkeley in our

1003
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,400
garden you could not go in there to talk

1004
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,318
it to somebody unless you talked about

1005
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,639
tomatoes and vegetables you could not

1006
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:37,838
you had to be in code in the 90s it was

1007
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,159
like such a big deal and uh you'd get

1008
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:40,759
it'd be funny because you'd be in the

1009
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,399
store and then every once in a while

1010
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,200
someone would come in and they'd slip

1011
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,358
yeah and you'd have angry people working

1012
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,719
at the place that wouldn't want to talk

1013
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,239
to you get out of here get out of here

1014
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,519
yeah we don't talk to people like that

1015
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,118
blah blah blah and it's like oh my God

1016
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,759
100% there was a I can't remember the

1017
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:55,519
name of the gr shop in North Hollywood

1018
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,880
but they would get so mad the old guys

1019
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,480
back there yeah don't say that grown

1020
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,240
tomatoes like okay I got you got you

1021
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,719
right and then um All Seasons opened up

1022
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,719
in uh

1023
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,759
Chatsworth and those guys are still

1024
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,639
around I mean they were my go-to they

1025
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,040
they're amazing yeah we didn't have to

1026
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,759
talk about it we all know what was going

1027
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,559
on you justed have to go in a black

1028
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,560
hoodie park down the street so that your

1029
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,358
licensed place wouldn't get photographed

1030
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,279
by law enforcement but with their the uh

1031
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,440
their binoculars recording everyone's

1032
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,599
license PLS back in the day it was funny

1033
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,159
yeah we were so separated from that

1034
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:32,680
world and I think there's a lot of

1035
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,639
people that are involved with

1036
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:39,318
today's cannabis economy that have no

1037
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:41,719
idea really what went on no uh and how

1038
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:43,119
illegal it was for for even small

1039
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,679
amounts for a six lighter you could get

1040
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,920
in big trouble and I mean I just had one

1041
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:53,679
I had one light but I grew 100 to 200

1042
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,119
colas wow sea green sea of green real

1043
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,759
small Forest you basically would flip

1044
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,200
right when you got the Clones yeah did

1045
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,480
you go I well I Grew From seed so I got

1046
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,838
seeds from markam and then had mothers

1047
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,079
because it was really difficult to get

1048
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,960
seeds back then yeah so we had to get

1049
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,720
them from Canada sometimes they would

1050
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,318
make it and sometimes they wouldn't yeah

1051

00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,598
9s especially in La I lived in um San

1073
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:06,440
Fernando Valley and I grew in apartment

1074
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,880
buildings like one or two bedrooms just

1075
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,760
blow them out and slept in the living

room did they have carbon filters back

1077
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,760

just come out yeah they had just come

1079
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,720
out in the 90s I mean I remember when

1080
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:21,039
they first came out and they didn't

1081
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,519
really work all that well in my garage

1082
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,639
they didn't work that well back then

1083
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:26,800
either the whole apartment complex

1084
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,759
smelled like weed multiple people were

1085
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,800
growing

1086
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,800
no just you just me but I kept my day

1087
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,640
job right you know I was a nanny or I

1088
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,000
was working at the preschool and my ex

1089
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,159
was in construction so we didn't drive

1090
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,559
flashy cars right you blame it on the

1091
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:43,399
weird neighbor you're like just them no

1092
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,200
no but nobody knew it was us yeah

1093
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:49,000
because we would come and go tot not fit

1094
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,358
the profile no no and they're like maybe

1095
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,960
it's the Russians oh maybe it's kids

1096
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,558
down there maybe C is on the top flooor

1097
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,079
yeah like never assumed that it was us I

1098
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:03,160
mean serbs definitely the serbs yeah I

1099
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,240
mean it's so crazy how people but it was

1100
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:07,598
dangerous it was absolutely dangerous

1101
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:09,558
and nobody would dare call the police or

1102
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,760
anything because the only people that

1103
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:14,640
were really growing were people that

1104
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,480
were really ready to die for it yeah and

1105
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:20,118
so it was super dangerous I mean there

1106
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,800
was a time where um one of the gangs

1107
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,720
found out that we were growing and

1108
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,640
luckily we were on the other side of the

1109
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,598
street so our ZIP code was not in their

1110
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:32,318
territory yeah but we had to stay up

1111
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,200
every night with a loaded 45 wow waiting

1112
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,358
to get executed by some gang that may

1113
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:38,439
come through the door right and that's

1114
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:41,358
when you realize like over a on lighter

1115
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,760
yeah over over over a one lighter yeah I

1116
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,920
had a one I had a Phototron that was my

1117
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,760
first indoor was with a

1118
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,280
Phototron from from High Times magazine

1119
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,720
that were in the back of High Times High

1120
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,559
Times magazine was really cool I mean

1121
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,598
that

1122
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,000
was where I got my inspiration from as a

1123
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:00,920
kid

1124
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,800
uh at a very young age probably too

1125
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,358
young for some some parents to want

1126
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,680
their kids to be into that kind of stuff

1127
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:11,719
but uh I think there was worse things to

1128
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:15,118
inspire to do oh gosh we we're the

1129
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:16,439
generation of um Faces of Death BHS

1130
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,119
going around you know what I mean like

1131
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,079
there's so much stuff that was worse

1132
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,039
Faces of Death and there was the bum

1133
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,960
fights oh my god I've been accused of oh

1134
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,199
this is a funny this is a funny rumor

1135
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,159
there's been not about bum fight

1136
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,000
shouldn't laugh because me either I it's

1137
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:32,440
ter hor but but there so there's been

1138
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,559
funny rumors that have been spread about

1139
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,440
me over the years right so one of the

1140
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,720
rumors was I got my money from bumfights

1141
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,760
that I was the original investor in

1142
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:41,759
bumfights that's not true guys oh my God

1143
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,440
and uh so but but it's funny hearing

1144
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,800
these rumors and then people were like

1145
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,079
oh yeah I remember hearing that about

1146
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,400
you and it's like had nothing to do with

1147
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,839
bum fights whatsoever and whoever came

1148
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,079
up with that is super creative I think

1149
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,960
it's funny but you know but not true at

1150
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,280
all so there's always rumors about

1151
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,838
people and it's like oh yeah oh yeah

1152
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,200
yeah yeah people told a rer that I in

1153
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,838
high school that I died at one point and

1154
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,239
it was only because I'd gone off the

1155
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:06,119
radar and I was living in La growing

1156
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,439
weed yeah they thought I they said that

1157
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:11,079
I got run over by a train I was like oh

1158
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,800
that's great yeah no I'm still alive

1159
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:16,800
yeah I had a friend that I thought he

1160
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,640
died in Desert Storm and for 20 years I

1161
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,680
thought he was dead and then he appeared

1162
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,960
on Facebook I'm like well he's not

1163
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:25,239
dead so yeah I used to party his house

1164
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,720
all the time I can't believe it like I'd

1165
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:31,078
been feeling bad about this guy like you

1166
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:32,799
know not to laugh or anything again but

1167
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,318
like it's funny how rumors happen and

1168
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,480
then social media exacerbates social

1169
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:40,440
media is so gross I mean the level of

1170
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,960
egos that we get out of the Cannabis

1171
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,760
industry over a couple tens of thousands

1172
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,559
of followers is just wild to me it's

1173
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,280
just it's wild yeah I mean let's spend a

1174
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:51,839
lot of our I I just posted the other day

1175
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,839
but let's spend a lot of our time every

1176
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,440
day arguing with people we know about

1177
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,199
stuff that doesn't even matter yeah you

1178
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,639
know and that's pretty much what it is I

1179
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:03,358
mean the thing is it's the most amazing

1180
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,719
beautiful and disgusting thing all at

1181
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,039
the same time and it's really how you

1182
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,039
use it and I feel like it can be used

1183
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,440
it's a tool just like anything else but

1184
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:14,639
it can be abused it can be used

1185
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,200
incorrectly and it can it can basically

1186
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:20,358
feed your ego and make you think that

1187
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:21,679
you're whatever yeah God or whatever

1188
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:23,480
think you're different than who you

1189
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,399
really are and sometimes we just need to

1190
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,440
be grounded and realize that we're all

1191
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,358
you know one guy I told them that we're

1192
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,720
all equal we're all the same and that

1193
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,318
that's in my opinion we're all equal and

1194
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:34,399
I don't care who you are and he said

1195
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:35,838
well that that's like giving

1196
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,280
participation Awards and I'm like that's

1197
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,920
not what I mean it's very different you

1198
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,000
know I mean I mean we're all equal on a

1199
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,760
spiritual level we're all equal on a

1200
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,838
physical level I mean you can talk

1201
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,520
about uh you know as far as like

1202
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:52,159
participation Awards being a bad thing

1203
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,519
and I think they are I think that we

1204
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,838
live in this world where participation

1205
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,440
Awards but as far as us being equal men

1206
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,639
and women being equal

1207
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,880
it doesn't matter what race what color

1208
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,960
what sex any of that stuff I mean I

1209
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,559
think that we are we should all be

1210
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,240
treated equal we all have a right to be

1211
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:11,839
here we were all born here we didn't

1212
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,519
have a choice nobody better than anybody

1213
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:14,599
and so I think that's a big problem is a

1214
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:16,519
lot of people start thinking they're

1215
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,440
better well I'm a better grower or I'm a

1216
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:20,318
better this right but it's it's all

1217
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,599
subjective and none of that stuff really

1218
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:24,119
matters it's at the same time it doesn't

1219
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,000
I better than anybody and nobody's

1220
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,640
better than me and as long as you can go

1221
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,318
and that's something my father really

1222
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:31,199
instilled from a young age is you're not

1223
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:33,679
better than anybody right but also

1224
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,118
nobody's better than you right and so

1225
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,358
the more you can think like that and I

1226
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,440
think we we want to strive to be better

1227
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,119
we want to strive to be better than

1228
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,240
ourselves not better than other people

1229
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:44,440
and I think that's where it gets lost

1230
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,399
right is like even though you're

1231
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,760
competing in whatever you're competing

1232
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,519
really you're just competing against

1233
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,319
yourself even if you're on a team you're

1234
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,199
just trying to do the best you can do to

1235
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:55,358
be a better person every day so

1236
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,039
hopefully over time you become a lot

1237
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,358
better there needs to be a lot of

1238
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,960
humbling in the Cannabis Community

1239
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,838
psychedelics will do that psychedelics

1240
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,838
will do that I hope they do more

1241
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:07,880
mushrooms um the last like year and a

1242
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,880
half like with being a fly on thewall

1243
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,559
and doing some networking in the

1244
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,480
Cannabis industry I was really kind of

1245
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:18,000
appalled um the level of

1246
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,559
misogyny um just the bullying the online

1247
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,239
bullying the online bullying is silly do

1248
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,079
it's ridiculous or this isn't Middle

1249
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:27,719
School guys no but but the the thing is

1250
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:29,000
is so I mean I try to look at it from

1251
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:30,439
the outside right because there is a lot

1252
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,599
of bullying there's people that try to

1253
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,960
bully me around and it's like I'm a big

1254
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:35,280
guy like in the real world you'd never

1255
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,199
bully me but you want to try to do it

1256
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,359
online go ahead right but the thing is

1257
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,318
is like I understand that those people

1258
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:42,519
have trauma that they've gone through

1259
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,480
most of those people were probably

1260
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,719
bullied when they were in school and so

1261
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,519
now they're online and they're like I'm

1262
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,919
gonna get this guy but it doesn't really

1263
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:54,358
matter yeah I care I'm not the stuff

1264
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,960
doesn't affect me I I think that

1265
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:57,440
sometimes it does actually to be honest

1266
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,960
sometimes it bothers me a little bit

1267
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:04,639
well we're human yeah we're human but I

1268
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:06,480
just I try to be grateful for all I have

1269
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,719
I think that I I try to live in

1270
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,880
gratitude and I think that's so

1271
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:13,159
important is living in gratitude to be

1272
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,119
grateful for what you have and not worry

1273
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,679
about what you don't have as much right

1274
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,920
you know I think we can strive to be

1275
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:22,159
better or we can strive to do amazing

1276
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,519
things uh and there's nothing Out Of

1277
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,358
Reach if we want it but we really have

1278
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:27,679
to be grateful for what we have because

1279
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:29,000
we don't know how long we're going to be

1280
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:32,879
here and we don't

1281
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,679
know how long we have to do all these

1282
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,440
great things it's all this stuff is

1283
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:39,000
finite right and so and psychedelics

1284
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,280
kind of really have opened me up to that

1285
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,119
to where I realize that like we have a

1286
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,440
limited time to do great things we have

1287
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,798
a limited time to tell the people that

1288
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,200
we care about that we love them you know

1289
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:51,400
little things like that yeah but those

1290
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:53,159
are the beautiful things in life when

1291
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,200
you can be grateful for what you have

1292
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:57,279
and and wake up and go this is

1293
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,239
pretty great and it could all be gone in

1294
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,960
the heartbeat but right now it's amazing

1295
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:06,558
yeah yeah I if people would spend more

1296
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:09,000
time um focused on their own projects

1297
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,400
yeah and pushing out the best that they

1298
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,440
can with their own projects instead of

1299
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,960
um creating unnecessary drama and being

1300
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,119
worried about other people working

1301
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,838
together working together is a

1302
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:23,160
collaborative you know effort in the

1303
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:25,558
community they would get so much further

1304
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:27,960
as opposed to just this race to the

1305
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:31,400
bottom well that's the future right so

1306
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,480
there will be the in the Cannabis uh

1307
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,960
scene especially there is the race to

1308
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,400
the bottom but along that line where we

1309
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,039
have this race to the bottom where it's

1310
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,559
going down we have collaboration coming

1311
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:45,480
in right and so the ones who collaborate

1312
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,480
are going to be successful and it takes

1313
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,039
a but but it also it's just the next

1314
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,679
Evolution because when we were growers

1315
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:55,838
in the 9s and in the early 2000s we had

1316
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,279
to do everything you were an electrician

1317
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:59,078
you were a carpenter

1318
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,798
you made extract a lot like I made

1319
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,559
extract I did Growing I did a I did

1320
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:06,838
trimming I did it all well then you

1321
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:09,440
start getting into a more advanced uh

1322
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,119
situation where okay well I can just

1323
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,760
focus on this and then I can have an

1324
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,838
extractor and I can have trimmers and I

1325
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,240
can all these things over time change

1326
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,880
and evolve right and so I just feel like

1327
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:20,798
the next evolution is going to be

1328
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,838
collaboration especially because you can

1329
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:25,960
work within a network of good people and

1330
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:28,119
whether it's companies finding those

1331
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,760
good people it is but if you're in the

1332
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:33,000
industry long enough you start finding

1333
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,440
people that you can attach yourself to

1334
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,880
that have a good reputation that do good

1335
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,358
work because although I feel like we've

1336
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,599
weeded all the bad people out that's

1337
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,480
never the case there's always going to

1338
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:45,039
be bad people that somehow are able to

1339
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,559
get in right right I feel like I weeded

1340
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,318
most of them out a long time ago but

1341
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,720
still we get Snakes in the Grass coming

1342
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:54,599
in posing is something else and then you

1343
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:57,719
realize oh man that person isn't who you

1344
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,200
perceive them to be yeah a lot of what

1345
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:01,598
we see in this reality is just

1346
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,798
perception oh yeah 100% so it's not

1347
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,599
always reality it's not it's not because

1348
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:08,440
what you perceive is an individual

1349
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:10,519
experience it's not a shared experience

1350
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,760
it's not a shared reality and once

1351
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:14,239
people realize that then you start to

1352
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,599
share your perceptions and you can come

1353
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,159
to an understanding and you communicate

1354
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,880
then you can share your different

1355
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,920
perceptions and come together in

1356
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,079
community that way and Community is so

1357
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,559
powerful it really genuinely is um and

1358
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,200
I've been blessed to find a lot of

1359
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,160
really great people in the Cannabis

1360
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,679
industry people that are passionate

1361
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,759
about the plant people that want to push

1362
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,719
it forward in a positive way for the

1363
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,040
right reasons for the right reasons like

1364
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:42,798
the regenerative Farmers Guild event

1365
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:44,400
that we're doing on June TW 22nd um it's

1366
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:46,079
going to be a monthly event and we're

1367
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,960
pulling the best Farmers from the

1368
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:53,039
mountain that are just about the plant

1369
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,679
about preserving the plant about pushing

1370
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,239
the best genetics forward about you know

1371
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,000
creating a future

1372
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:01,239
for their children for themselves and

1373
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,679
for people around them right and that's

1374
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:07,479
important it's not about an ego it's not

1375
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:09,358
about um I did this or that or the other

1376
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,240
thing like right what what does that

1377
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:14,279
matter 10 years from now 20 years from

1378
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:16,039
now 30 years from now like who cares

1379
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,640
yeah there are 8 billion people in this

1380
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:21,639
world how many people know you by name

1381
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:24,358
like you're insignificant in the grand

1382
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:26,519
scheme of things yeah but as a

1383
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,719
collective effort as a collective

1384
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,559
Consciousness that's the beauty of all

1385
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:32,798
of this is the collective Consciousness

1386
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,079
cuz we all just play a role in the

1387
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:38,798
greater Collective consciousness of

1388
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:41,000
existence is how I feel um from what

1389
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:42,599
I've seen and what I've experienced and

1390
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,480
that's the beauty of it if we can get

1391
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,838
rid of ego and realize that we're all

1392
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,599
just a part of something so much bigger

1393
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:51,759
than ourselves that we can't even fully

1394
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:54,318
comprehend it's amazing it really is it

1395
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:58,160
really is I think when people grasp that

1396
00:53:54,318 --> 00:54:01,079
and fully um you know delve into that

1397
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:03,118
experience um it humbles people and when

1398
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,640
you get humbled on that level then you

1399
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,920
start to see that you have a lot of work

1400
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,838
to do within yourself yeah and once you

1401
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,798
start working on yourself then you can

1402
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:13,000
help other people yeah and it's never

1403
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:14,639
over I feel like it's a it's something

1404
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,719
you strive for and it's something that

1405
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,598
you have to work out on a daily basis

1406
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,679
100% because the second you feel like

1407
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:24,039
you know it all you're so far away from

1408
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,480
any sort of like understanding of it I'm

1409
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:27,358
scared of people who say they know

1410
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,519
everything yeah I have yeah I have

1411
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:30,960
friends that think they know everything

1412
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:32,440
too and it's like but they need more

1413
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,920
psychedelics for one thing they need

1414
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,280
more psychedelics and they need to read

1415
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,798
more yeah but it's like no no one person

1416
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,680
can understand all of it no you can't be

1417
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:43,280
good at everything but if you work hard

1418
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,199
at one thing you can be really good at

1419
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,079
that you can be a master oh you can be a

1420
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:50,558
master absolutely and and it doesn't

1421
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,240
take Natural Born skill always a lot of

1422
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,760
times repetition is what's going to make

1423
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:57,318
you successful showing up for yourself

1424
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,880
yeah yeah the consistency repetition the

1425
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:02,239
practice I mean and that's what I

1426
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,119
learned as a child my mom's Korean so

1427
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:07,479
talk about piano lessons violin lessons

1428
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,880
like yeah repetition repetition every

1429
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,719
day every day to get better and better

1430
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,280
um and that's with anything and that's

1431
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:17,679
what life's all about yeah 100% so tell

1432
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:20,798
me more about the church so I founded

1433
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,639
this church to create a safe space and a

1434
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:26,880
Haven for plant medicine and under that

1435
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,838
umbrella it it um includes

1436
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,720
um

1437
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:35,038
psilocybin DMT cacti outside of

1438
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:39,719
peyote and cannabis people use these

1439
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:42,480
products to or sacraments to heal

1440
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:46,639
themselves um for Spiritual

1441
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,838
purposes and um my goal is to have the

1442
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:52,118
cleanest plant medicine available to

1443
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:54,719
people so that they can find that path

1444
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,960
wow and um

1445
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,838
ultimately um I would like to be able to

1446
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,880
get to a position where we can subsidize

1447
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:03,759
medicine for people in the streets of

1448
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,039
Oakland to help them get off opioids and

1449
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,400
methamp fetamines and hard drugs in the

1450
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:10,720
street so that they can you know reverse

1451
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,920
their lives back to you know a path that

1452
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:16,558
is um one that they got derailed from

1453
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,000
well most of the psychedelics are still

1454
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,880
a schedule one

1455
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,119
yes but I think that's going to change I

1456
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:27,240
think so I think so I especially

1457
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:31,039
mushrooms Sol side specifically cin

1458
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:35,879
because um the VA is working with um

1459
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:37,720
Veterans for PTSD for PTSD um you have

1460
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,760
people in the pharmaceutical industry

1461
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:42,838
that are working on it um you have

1462
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,359
Academia that's working on it so um

1463
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:47,759
there's a lot of research that's going

1464
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:51,078
into it that is behind it right so it's

1465
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,839
not just a party drug it's it's a

1466
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:56,519

a micro do and ated into their lives and

1490
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,358
talk about like the the science behind

1491
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,000
it so when you're talking 5 Meo for

1492
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,239
people that aren't familiar that are

1493
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,079
watching the podcast and they're hearing

1494
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:10,399
it for the first time are we talking

1495
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:14,480
about

1496
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:17,079
buffo uh toad Venom yes specifically yes

1497
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:21,119
and so she's a spiritual healer she's a

1498
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:23,920
ceremony holder um she has extensive

1499
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,160
experience in that so that's I I'm not a

1500
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,039
spiritual healer so I pass that off to

1501
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,960
people who have the expertise in that

1502
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:33,280
but the San Pedro that's a great one it

1503
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,920
is yeah that's that's another one that

1504
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,960
will get your stomach

1505
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:41,519
turning so we have a guy who's who's a

1506
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,838
cacti expert who comes through and does

1507
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:47,639
vending and and he wants to do a class

1508
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:50,679
on grafting and talk about um extraction

1509
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,920
and all the benefits of it as well wow

1510
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:54,639
that's really cool yeah and the funny

1511
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,639
thing is San Pedra is one of those ones

1512
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,159
where you see it growing random in

1513
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,400
Berkeley and Oakland you know like

1514
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,598
driving by people's houses there's these

1515
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,440
big San Pedro cactus so all over the US

1516
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:09,318
it's get in at Home Depot yeah so it's

1517
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,079
very common yeah yeah so yeah people

1518
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:12,719
don't even know they have it going and

1519
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:14,280
oh they got that magic grown right in

1520
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,239
their front yard right it was just a

1521
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,880
cool looking plant

1522
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,759
yeah yeah it's it's really beautiful I

1523
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,400
mean Cactus just in general is

1524
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,520
amazing yeah I mean our main focus is

1525
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,079
mushrooms just because that's where my

1526
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:30,639
is right we do provide genetics and grow

1527
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,559
kits and teach people how to grow their

1528
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:34,798
own medicine because it's not just about

1529
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,000
being a dispensary model you know we're

1530
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,759
more of like a community space where we

1531
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,318
give education and we want people to be

1532
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,880
able to do it on their own so if someone

1533
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:46,880
wants to come to church on

1534
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,240
Sunday um we all have events typically

1535
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,838
is it every day or you guys not every

1536
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,838
day we have like two or three days a

1537
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:55,480
week we have events um we do have an

1538
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:59,159
event called um dabs and doodles which

1539
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,679
is we we open up the doors for free to

1540
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:05,199
Street artists graffiti artists they

1541
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:07,558
come and share hash and we'll have a

1542
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,679
couple vendors and it's just a very

1543
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:12,400
chill environment those graffiti artists

1544
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:13,838
those writers all like smoking hash yes

1545
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,358
it seems not all of them because we had

1546
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:18,920
The Luminaries and only one out of the

1547
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,838
three guys actually smoked but the ones

1548
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,920
I know a lot of them like hash they like

1549
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:26,078
hash they like mushrooms Ros and and

1550
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,760
mushrooms St yeah we just had an event

1551
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,599
with um the Lord's crew and so they

1552
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:34,359
painted the auxiliary building we did an

1553
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,720
art show so we do a lot of things that

1554
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:39,960
are um Community Based right right and

1555
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:43,279
so church is counter cultur Community

1556
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,639
Based gota love it yes just getting the

1557
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,599
the message of what mushrooms do out

1558
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:53,400
there in maybe a less than Orthodox way

1559
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:55,680
but um I don't focus on just one subset

1560
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,079
of people but this isn't just for the

1561
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:01,118
one % that can afford like a

1562
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:04,000
$155,000 ceremony this is this is for

1563
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,798
everybody and we're losing people in all

1564
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,838
communities well it's sad that it's been

1565
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:10,400
commercialized right that at least

1566
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:11,960
that's my feeling is that part of part

1567
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,559
of it is sad that it's been

1568
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,720
commercialized to where people feel they

1569
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:18,160
have to go away for the healing and and

1570
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:21,679
maybe there is benefit to that and I

1571
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:23,239
think it's great right but uh you know I

1572
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:25,598
think burning man has kind of changed

1573
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:27,598
too over the years I went a long long

1574
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,880
time ago and it was completely different

1575
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,119
not that there's anything wrong I don't

1576
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,599
know because I haven't gone but I see

1577
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,200
people flying in Jets and helicopters

1578
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,880
like especially helicopters and it's

1579
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:41,558
like that was never a thing 20 years ago

1580
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,599
right uh and then iasa ceremonies were

1581
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:45,760
probably you know your your flight

1582
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:46,960
that's all you pretty much had to pay

1583
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,000
for because everything else was so

1584
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,079
inexpensive and now it's a commercial

1585
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,079
business and so they've commercialized

1586
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:55,200
the

1587
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:57,278
healing and not that there's anything

1588
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,278
wrong with Comm izing stuff but I feel

1589
01:01:57,278 --> 01:02:01,679
like you take away part of the magic too

1590
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:03,880
with it and and it it makes it so that

1591
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,519
only very few people have access to it

1592
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,920
and then you take away access and that's

1593
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,038
where you lose the

1594
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,480
magic because it's for everybody it is

1595
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:14,119
for everybody and that's why I think

1596
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,599
it's awesome that uh Oregon

1597
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:18,480
decriminalized Statewide I don't think I

1598
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,119
heard reversing that by the way I I bet

1599
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,119
they are I bet they are I think it's

1600
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:24,920
crazy that they did did that to be I

1601
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:28,160
think it's great that they did it in

1602
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:30,880
some ways but meth being able to possess

1603
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:33,118
drugs like meth or even small amounts

1604
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,640
like I think th those things need to be

1605
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,440
off the streets personally no 100% it

1606
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:41,159
there's I don't see any value in meth

1607
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,920
heroin fentanyl F there's no value in

1608
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:45,118
and it it takes away from society it

1609
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:49,519
doesn't help people it destroys

1610
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:54,079
lives uh it's not positive no it's not

1611
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:56,278
it's not and soloc cybin is proven to

1612
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,798
help reverse that crisis I think it

1613
01:02:56,278 --> 01:03:00,559
makes the world a better place to be

1614
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:02,000
honest yeah um I think there's a handful

1615
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,319
cannabis makes the world a better place

1616
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,318
that's why I'm doing what I do that's

1617
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,639
what I love about it is it it makes the

1618
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:10,119
world a better place and there's things

1619
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:11,358
that contribute to making Society better

1620
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,838
and there's things that take away from

1621
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:18,159
it right and I think that these hard

1622
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:19,519
drugs uh they take away from it and you

1623
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:20,679
know the fact that Oregon just went

1624
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:22,519
across the bort and said we're going to

1625
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,879
do everything for possession is okay I

1626
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:26,759
think that's a little crazy I think we

1627
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,240
need c like I don't know about putting

1628
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,960
people in jail that are that are addicts

1629
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:34,519
I think maybe that's not the solution

1630
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:37,679
but I treatment therapy and treatment

1631
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:39,719
and uh Solutions we need solutions for

1632
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,838
those people Homeless Solutions I think

1633
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:44,239
one of the biggest problems is our

1634
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,639
homeless problem right solving that I

1635
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:47,278
don't know what the answer is because

1636
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:49,798
everybody's like oh it's a bad thing and

1637
01:03:47,278 --> 01:03:51,960
it's like what's the solution I think

1638
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:54,960
it's so complicated that there's not

1639
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,559
just one answer it's it's over a long

1640
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,159
period of time it took us a long time to

1641
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,000
get to this point where we have tents in

1642
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:03,358
Oakland on on Bridges there's

1643
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,239
communities of homeless people it took

1644
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:08,598
us a long time to get to this point uh

1645
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:11,879
my parents were friends with a guy who

1646
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:13,960
basically starved himself to make a

1647
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:17,838
point for for months and months and

1648
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:19,318
months to bring attention to the fact

1649
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,159
that we weren't taking care it was all

1650
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:22,679
mentally ill people the majority of

1651
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:25,440
people that are homeless are mentally

1652
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:27,000
ill and I would say that that's still

1653
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,358
the case case but it's not all the case

1654
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,920
I mean it's California it's it's a rough

1655
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:33,880
time out there it's expensive and we

1656
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,159
don't have enough Solutions and you know

1657
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,599
there's a lot of countries that have

1658
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:38,278
solutions for homeless you were talking

1659
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:41,119
about Cuba yeah you know you don't see

1660
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:43,159
homeless people in Cuba uh Scandinavian

1661
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,680
countries you know they have solutions

1662
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:47,480
for these things and they're thought of

1663
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:49,118
because the government cares about their

1664
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,240
people I'd like to think that people in

1665
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,880
our government care about people but as

1666
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:55,199
a whole it's it's tough it's tough to

1667
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,358
look at our government saying that they

1668
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,879
care about people people and then you

1669
01:04:56,358 --> 01:05:00,519
see people homeless in Oakland and San

1670
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,920
Francisco and I do think there's

1671
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:04,639
politicians that care I honestly do

1672
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,519
think there are good politicians and bad

1673
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:09,598
politicians and it's not just bad across

1674
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:10,719
the board but it's perception I mean

1675
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,359
when you're going down the street in

1676
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:16,519
Oakland it's hard to think good about

1677
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:18,239
anybody uh that has any sort of say on

1678
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:20,798
anything when there's people living in

1679
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,519
tents and communities and there's people

1680
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:25,119
getting robbed and beaten and killed in

1681
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,038
Oakland in the streets and Oakland's the

1682
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,358
worst it's ever been that I that I

1683
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,200
remember at least in my lifetime as an

1684
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:34,719
adult it's it's honestly the roughest

1685
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:37,199
it's ever been yeah I I volunteered for

1686
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:39,759
two years with um punks with lunch which

1687
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:42,358
is a nonprofit that my friend Alandra

1688
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,200
started um almost eight years ago nice

1689
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:49,358
and every Sunday we would go out and do

1690
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:53,358
harm reduction um meals and clothing and

1691
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:56,519
hygiene and um two years it it took a

1692
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:59,519
toll on me uh when you when it started

1693
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:02,199
when I started volunteering um it was at

1694
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:05,000
the beginning of gentrification in West

1695
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:07,439
Oakland so in the beginning you would

1696
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,199
just see mostly people addicted to drugs

1697
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,798
mental health issues

1698
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:15,078
runaways uh kids that got misplaced

1699
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:17,719
after the foster care system let them go

1700
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:20,000
um and then over those two years you

1701
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:23,199
started seeing families you started

1702
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,639
seeing like working parents with kids

1703
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:29,879
living in tents because they got evicted

1704
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:32,719
um it's the economy that's that's the

1705
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,838
that's the Catalyst to all of this um

1706
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:39,759
the lack of Health Care the lack of

1707
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:43,199
Education the lack of um just living

1708
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:46,720
just a a living wage nobody can live off

1709
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:49,838
of $15 an hour in Oakland or no in 15

1710
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:52,519
isn't worth what 15 was before no you

1711
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,519
know you look you look at the the value

1712
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:57,278
of the dollar is depreciated so much

1713
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:58,880
over the period it's not houses are more

1714
01:06:57,278 --> 01:07:00,960
I mean they're more expensive right but

1715
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,200
it's not like they're worth more no it's

1716
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,639
because the value of the dollar is much

1717
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:08,078
less yeah and we haven't matched the

1718
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,078
salaries because you used to be able to

1719
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:13,200
be a janitor the 50s and 60s and you

1720
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:16,599
could still earn a living wage and buy a

1721
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:19,798
house off of that salary right and it's

1722
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:21,079
it's just changed so much and I like to

1723
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:22,400
think that it's getting better but I

1724
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:26,839
feel like it's still going to get worse

1725
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:30,599
before it gets better yeah I think um

1726
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:32,719
the economy has to change first and um

1727
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:34,920
we need to provide basic services for

1728
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:36,439
people well and I feel like the economy

1729
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,358
goes up and down no matter what we're

1730
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,599
going to have a better economy and then

1731
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:40,639
we're going to have a worse economy and

1732
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,359
that's just going to fluctuate

1733
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:45,558
throughout time I just there's not

1734
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:48,078
enough awareness of reality and what

1735
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:50,559
happened over the last 20 years is the

1736
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,160
middle class has gone away yeah and so

1737
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,960
we look at where we're at right now and

1738
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:55,038
you're on one spectrum of the other

1739
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,920
there's not a lot of people that are

1740
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,160
just happily living in the middle you're

1741
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,599
either pushed towards the upper or

1742
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:03,639
you're pushed towards the lower and it's

1743
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,079
a big struggle it's a big struggle for a

1744
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:07,598
lot of people I mean you can't blame

1745
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:09,680
people for robbing and stealing when

1746
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,119
they can't provide for their families

1747
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:14,480
off of a basic wage like what would you

1748
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:15,920
do well I think there's opportunist

1749
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,719
there there's a difference though right

1750
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,199
so there's there I see the if if you're

1751
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:23,759
stealing CU you're hungry and you're

1752
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:25,119
stealing food uh that's very different

1753
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,079
than if you're an opportunist and you're

1754
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:28,679
going with your friends to Rob Nordstrom

1755
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:29,838
and steal as much clothes as you can so

1756
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:32,319
you can steal them off the streets or

1757
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:35,000
you're breaking into people's cars you

1758
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:36,640
know it's just so there's very for me

1759
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,319
it's like I there's a separation here

1760
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,000
like the opportunist I I think those

1761
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:44,279
people are not doing the right thing and

1762
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,798
if my family was starving I would do

1763
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:48,600
whatever it took to feed them and I

1764
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:51,359
think that's a very different situation

1765
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,560
and I think it it depends it's not a one

1766
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,199
siiz fits also and that's why it's so

1767
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,279
hard to deal with it's like well what's

1768
01:08:55,198 --> 01:09:00,838
the solution well it's not one thing

1769
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:02,600
there's so many steps and so many things

1770
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,798
that have to happen over time right I

1771
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,679
mean even when I was volunteering like

1772
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,838
trying to think of like what's the

1773
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:11,759
solution yeah it's daunting like where

1774
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:14,798
do you begin yeah where do you even

1775
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:17,198
began it's it starts with people just

1776
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:19,560
helping each other in the streets yeah

1777
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,158
it starts with people who have to start

1778
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,000
chch was compassion yeah totally I agree

1779
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,679
compassion and empathy and just

1780
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,119
understanding that it's very Poss POS

1781
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,079
for you to end up in their shoes it

1782
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:32,198
doesn't take that much no you know it

1783
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:34,198
really doesn't and when people get that

1784
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:36,278
into perspective and you start

1785
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:38,238
humanizing the people on the street as

1786
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:39,920
opposed to seeing them as throwaway

1787
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,759
people and understanding that they are

1788
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,399
people's family they are people's loved

1789
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,838
ones and start to treat them that way

1790
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:50,399
yeah then it changes it changes

1791
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:53,600
yeah yeah I mean that's I guess that's

1792
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:56,399
the beauty of living in Oakland is the

1793
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,440
exposure too I mean puts the world into

1794
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,158
perspective unfortunately and I don't

1795
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:03,599
know what what's going to happen I I

1796
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:07,359
really all I know is that uh the one

1797
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,600
thing Coston is change uhuh and so if

1798
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,399
it's not going to stay the same no

1799
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,640
matter what we're changing and evolving

1800
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:13,679
people thought I was going to be easy

1801
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,800
money in the Cannabis industry forever

1802
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,920
they thought it was easy money in the

1803
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,679
mushroom PCT they thought it was going

1804
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,760
to be easy money and it was for the

1805
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,119
people in the beginning there was some

1806
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:23,520
people that crushed it but that was a

1807
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:25,479
very short window and I would say the

1808
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,199
real reason why I wasn't excited to get

1809
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:29,718
into mushrooms is because I realized

1810
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:31,039
like when I take mushrooms I don't want

1811
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:32,920
if I take a big dose I don't want to

1812
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:35,000
take it for a long time I smoke weed

1813
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:38,079
every day right right I I'll puff on

1814
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,359
some when I go home my smoke and wear as

1815
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:45,079
mushrooms I do selectively and over the

1816
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:47,119
period of the last 33 years uh I've done

1817
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:49,119
it in waves throughout my life right

1818
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:51,119
it's never been a constant even when I

1819
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:52,760
did the micro doing and so it has a

1820
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,640
ceiling to it whereas cannabis can at

1821
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:57,159
least keep grow there's definitely a

1822
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,159
ceiling to to the amount of mushrooms I

1823
01:10:57,158 --> 01:10:59,799
mean we still haven't reached that

1824
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,399
ceiling it's going to be a long time

1825
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,320
before we reach it but there is a

1826
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:04,599
ceiling and it's because of awareness

1827
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:06,198
like the more people that are aware of

1828
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,480
it the more people that will try it and

1829
01:11:06,198 --> 01:11:13,079
benefit from it yeah and when you tap

1830
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:17,799
into um what those you know outcomes are

1831
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:21,079
as far as like PTSD and um brain trauma

1832
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,960
and those you know physical things that

1833
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:24,600
are going on in your brain and knowing

1834
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,039
that the medicine really helps you in

1835
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,679
that way

1836
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:31,119
getting that word out to more and more

1837
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,880
people I mean there 273 275 million

1838
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:36,119
people in the world or in the US in the

1839
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,319
US um 2 I think it's 273 last time I

1840
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:39,039
checked but it's been a it's been a

1841
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:41,359
little minute I think it's 350 million

1842
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:43,439
is it really now I'm not sure we'll

1843
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:45,000
we'll uh check that one we'll fact check

1844
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,678
that one we'll fact check that one

1845
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,279
totally but that's a lot of people it's

1846
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,920
a lot of people that's a lot of people

1847
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:54,719
who would take mushrooms and not take

1848
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,960
and not swep weed right you know because

1849
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,880
if you're take it like a vitamin medic

1850
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:02,800
for medicine yeah as a vitamin I mean I

1851
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:05,000
think that but also cannabis we we're

1852
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,000
still exploring the use for that so I

1853
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,479
think plant medicine is we're just

1854
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,960
scratching the surface of it and we're

1855
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:15,000
going back you know and this

1856
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:16,880
is a long time coming yeah and and I

1857
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,560
think it's going to go back to a lot of

1858
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,920
plant-based medicine we're going to look

1859
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,239
at stuff and go this is actually better

1860
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:27,319
and more suitable and has less side

1861
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:29,000
effects way less dangerous right and you

1862
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:31,359
know I think it'll be custom tailored

1863
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,479
too just we we know of all these canono

1864
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,799
and we know of all these tpin and we're

1865
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:36,718
talking about flavorants and other

1866
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,760
things and how they work with the

1867
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,480
Entourage effect together and so we're

1868
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,400
just scratching the surface on how do we

1869
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:46,439
apply this medicine and there the best

1870
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,759
part of changing the scheduling to

1871
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:49,559
schedule three is now we can do more

1872
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,039
research and so once they go from

1873
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,719
schedule one with siloc cybin to

1874
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:55,359
schedule two or three or four or

1875
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:57,079
whatever they change it to will be bble

1876
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:58,960
to do even more research and clinical

1877
01:12:57,079 --> 01:13:00,319
trials and that's where they start

1878
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,079
finding the magic that's where they

1879
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:03,960
start finding okay well this works great

1880
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:06,600
for this and now we've solved the

1881
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,840
problem my fear with that though is that

1882
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,600
pharmaceutical companies will take over

1883
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,600
and control it all I agree it I mean

1884
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,480
it's but I try not to live in fear right

1885
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,560
so so my biggest thing is like because

1886
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:19,198
I'm always scared of that with the

1887
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,480
Cannabis industry that I know what's

1888
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:23,599
coming I see what's coming I see what's

1889
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:27,119
coming with plant patents I see what's

1890
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:30,320
coming with uh pharmaceutical standards

1891
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:33,119
and not just GMP but like ISO standards

1892
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:35,719
and stuff like that they especially when

1893
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:38,920
we're talking about labs and stuff like

1894
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:40,439
that uh but but even just standard uh

1895
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:43,239
GMP

1896
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:45,559
process uh most people aren't ready for

1897
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:47,119
it right and so there will be people

1898
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,199
that lose but there it's still an

1899
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,960
Agricultural Product and there's still

1900
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:54,039
going to have Farmers farming and I

1901
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:58,039
think that the ones that are in now I

1902
01:13:54,039 --> 01:14:01,000
feel like they we had uh Ridgeline farms

1903
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:03,238
and we had Huckleberry Hill Farms and

1904
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,479
those guys are great examples of two of

1905
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:07,119
the several companies that I see moving

1906
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,479
into the market in the future and

1907
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,760
expanding and once interstate commerce

1908
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:13,000
goes they can start growing and sharing

1909
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,159
their product with people all around the

1910
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,158
United States because we're so limited

1911
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:19,359
with wreck in that regard and that's

1912
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:21,679
going to change and that excites me yeah

1913
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,759
and so even though there is like a

1914
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:26,960
little bit of fear of the pharmaceutical

1915
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:29,039
takeover and that's going to impact us

1916
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,880
I'm not as worried about that when I see

1917
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,719
guys like Johnny from Huckleberry Hill

1918
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,560
Farm who has a a cult ofar that makes

1919
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:38,960
you feel absolutely

1920
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,400
amazing um and then we got Jason from

1921
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,198
Ridgeline he's got he's the he's got the

1922
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:45,559
latest and greatest and he's doing mixed

1923
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:47,759
light he's also doing outdoor but but

1924
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:51,480
his mixed light stuff is comparable to

1925
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:54,239
indoor and it's the future and so we're

1926
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:55,759
evolving and what happens with the

1927
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,279
pharmaceutical IND industry yeah they're

1928
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,840
going to try to take they want to take

1929
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:00,599
people want to take over that's how it's

1930
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,199
it's it's the human nature to want to

1931
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:05,120
own it to want to to want to take it all

1932
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:07,960
right for it to all be mine that's the

1933
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:09,198
human nature in people and we need to

1934
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,480
get away from that a little bit and try

1935
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,599
to share more it's American it's just

1936
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:15,079
it's it's very American very American

1937
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,360
it's very American I gota have very

1938
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:20,359
Texan I want to have the I want have the

1939
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:22,679
biggest the best right all this stuff

1940
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:23,880
and and a lot of that is ego if we could

1941
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:26,039
kill a little bit of that ego the world

1942
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,600
would be a better place I think

1943
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:30,639
100 you know I think the other thing is

1944
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,400
we live in excess in in the United

1945
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:34,039
States especially in the United States

1946
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:35,839
you don't see it in Europe quite as much

1947
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:37,359
although we are definitely influencing

1948
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,159
them there's more overweight people in

1949
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:41,799
Europe than there ever has been and

1950
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:44,879
there's fast food restaurants all over

1951
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:47,119
Europe too now and uh you know we got

1952
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:50,520
the Nikes and they got the

1953
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:52,039
influence uh but I feel like everything

1954
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,199
goes in waves so we're going to go

1955
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:55,679
through this and then we're going to go

1956
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,279
through good periods and

1957
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,319
you know I think a lot of stuff skips

1958
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:03,479
Generations too so like hard workers the

1959
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:05,119
sometimes uh parents are really hard

1960
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:08,119
workers they want to work so hard that

1961
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:09,399
their kids have an easy life yeah right

1962
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:10,559
and that's not necessarily the good way

1963
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:11,719
because then their kids are going to

1964
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,159
have an easy life but they might not

1965
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:15,000
have money for their kids so their kids

1966
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:16,719
are going to have to suffer so it skips

1967
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,719
a generation and then their kids become

1968
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:23,520
hard workers and so on and so forth

1969
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:25,520
forever and so yeah what is this saying

1970
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,880
tough men create

1971
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:33,560
uh easy times and then EAS and then easy

1972
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:36,119
times create weak men and then weak men

1973
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:39,280
create hard times and hard times create

1974
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:42,119
tough men and so that

1975
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,399
pattern uh like many things it's it's a

1976
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:46,479
pattern that goes on we go through these

1977
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:49,359
fluctuations and just like the economy

1978
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:51,559
going up and down right and so we went

1979
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:53,799
away from PL medicine I I we went away

1980
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,560
from hemp which is the silliest thing in

1981
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,920
the whole world that we went away from

1982
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:02,159
hemp as a society and hemp is so

1983
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:05,600
valuable and we turn it onto things like

1984
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:08,198
cotton you know which is not nearly as

1985
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,600
eco-friendly nearly as strong and

1986
01:17:08,198 --> 01:17:12,919
durable and we as a society went away

1987
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,679
from that and that's to me that's so

1988
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,920
crazy because if you look a 100 years in

1989
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:17,679
the past or 100 years in the future

1990
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,960
they'd be like you guys were nuts right

1991
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,639
you guys really screwed up on that one

1992
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,198
among other things among other things

1993
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:25,880
but that one by itself is just like wow

1994
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:29,439
we really sced up on the hemp and I

1995
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:32,199
think we fed corn or not now now we feed

1996
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:34,919
all the cattle corn and I think before

1997
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:37,158
we were feeding a lot of hemp and so

1998
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:40,800
we're talking about canabo possibly

1999
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:44,039
being in the milk that we drank and we

2000
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,600
have all these autoimmune diseases maybe

2001
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,679
there's a relation maybe there's not but

2002
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,039
there's definitely something going on

2003
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:52,639
with the nutrition that we get oh the

2004
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:54,519
nutrition has dropped significantly oh

2005
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:57,400
yeah with all the produce because of

2006
01:17:54,520 --> 01:18:01,239
them you know the the

2007
01:17:57,399 --> 01:18:04,238
companies that have been patenting just

2008
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:06,319
corn and and soybeans and all of you

2009
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:10,319
know our basic putting seed oils and

2010
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:14,920
everything and and just uh you know with

2011
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:17,119
the patents came control and um lack of

2012
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:20,158
biodiversity yeah and so we've lost a

2013
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:22,158
lot of species of corn lot everything

2014
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:23,799
Tomatoes it's we have we have a what

2015
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,799
four types of tomatoes in theore it's

2016
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:28,840
crazy if that bananas we have we have

2017
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,239
two so that's that's a huge contributing

2018
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:34,159
factor to the lack of nutrition in the

2019
01:18:31,238 --> 01:18:36,238
food um and it's scary it's scary I I

2020
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:37,719
try not to talk about you know scary

2021
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:40,039
things or fear-based

2022
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:43,560
models but when you have the knowledge

2023
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:47,560
of the biopiracy that's going on and um

2024
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:49,199
the patenting of life um and and the

2025
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,360
that control being in the hands of very

2026
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:53,638
few people um you need to have people

2027
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:56,238
with boots on the ground that are

2028
01:18:53,639 --> 01:19:01,199
working against that and preserving

2029
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:02,919
genetics and preserving um the diversity

2030
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:06,319
of all different kinds of plants and

2031
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,319
species because um that's the future of

2032
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:09,840
life on Earth future of our children and

2033
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:12,000
our children's children and their

2034
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:15,119
children and that's what Americans don't

2035
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,359
genuinely think about is generational

2036
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,920
they think of right me right now and

2037
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,000
when I die or who's going to take care

2038
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,399
me when I die and there is generational

2039
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,639
wealth to a small percentage but if you

2040
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:27,399
look in other countries the generational

2041
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:29,679
wealth is much bigger where stuff has

2042
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:32,879
passed down through multiple Generations

2043
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:34,399
Asia especially like Italy too you don't

2044
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,199
have a lot of homeless people in Italy

2045
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,879
because those the properties are all

2046
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:40,839
passed to their children and home stay

2047
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,079
in the family um it's not how it happens

2048
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:44,239
here in the US

2049
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:47,920
unfortunately bass

2050
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,879
Awards yep seriously Common Sense isn't

2051
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,000
common

2052
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,279
anymore but I think there's people we're

2053
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,279
talking about it today so at least

2054
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:58,359
there's that at least we recognize it we

2055
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,439
can talk about it I think uh the fact

2056
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:01,880
that we're talking about it our

2057
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:04,759
ancestors would be they would be proud

2058
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,520
of us but I guess the the two people

2059
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:09,719
that you really need to make proud in

2060
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,400
your life are your 18y old self and your

2061
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:14,920
80y old self you can do that you're

2062
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:18,439
doing okay that's a good that's a good

2063
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,359
way to live yeah that makes sense so my

2064
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:22,319
18-year- old self is super stoked on

2065
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:25,319
everything I've done my 80y old self

2066
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:27,639
we're working on that one we'll see but

2067
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:31,279
if I make it to you

2068
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:33,039
know my my 18-year-old self is like yeah

2069
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:35,679
makes sense what you're doing right now

2070
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:37,600
totally when I was 18 I had like tons of

2071
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:40,158
High Times magazines and I was all about

2072
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:43,800
it yeah and the fact that I'm here now

2073
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:47,359
is just a blessing yeah so yeah so one

2074
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:49,639
last question before you go if there was

2075
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,839
one piece of advice for your younger

2076
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:53,800
self that you would give your younger

2077
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,119
self now after all you've experienced

2078
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:59,079
what would that one thing be don't trust

2079
01:20:56,119 --> 01:21:01,960
everyone so easily and go with your

2080
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:03,639
intuition and don't stop being generous

2081
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,679
despite

2082
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:09,239
people being negative or I don't know

2083
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:11,440
being bad yeah I guess my 18-year-old

2084
01:21:09,238 --> 01:21:14,799
self would just say to to be careful who

2085
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,960
you trust and um you know choose your

2086
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,480
friends

2087
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,399
wisely nice that's all I can say because

2088
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:23,039
that I I feel like that's great and

2089
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:25,119
everybody has different answers and we

2090
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:28,279
get so much stuff and I feel like we're

2091
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:30,439
have a show of just the answers of what

2092
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:32,880
people would tell their younger selves

2093
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:34,158
and it's like it's it's so great you

2094
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,000
know especially the collective

2095
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:38,279
Consciousness right I'm sure people have

2096
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,198
said some like I don't know I can't even

2097
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:42,759
imagine what other people would think

2098
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:44,719
yeah save your money you got to see

2099
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,320
that's a big one save your money don't

2100
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:50,439
do so many drugs so fast or so much it's

2101
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:51,719
all going to be okay all going to be

2102
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:55,119
okay

2103
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:58,359
um yeah we always bounce back yeah

2104
01:21:55,119 --> 01:22:00,800
humans are resilient you always back you

2105
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:03,079
will always bounce back and usually when

2106
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,440
you bounce back you bounce back higher

2107
01:22:03,079 --> 01:22:08,519
than where you you were before life is

2108
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:10,439
about lessons don't be afraid to fail

2109
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,920
that's that's one of the biggest for me

2110
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:14,359
I think that's the biggest is don't ever

2111
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,800
be afraid to fail because you're going

2112
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:17,039
to keep fa if you want to be successful

2113
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,639
you're going to keep failing and you're

2114
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,279
going to keep getting up and and doing

2115
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,520
it and then show up for yourself I think

2116
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:26,238
that's the other big one is show up for

2117
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:27,960
yourself and and I wish more kids could

2118
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:30,158
hear that

2119
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,719
that sometimes you don't like doing

2120
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,839
stuff uh but to be good at something you

2121
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,920
have to do it a lot you have to practice

2122
