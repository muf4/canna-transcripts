yeah

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:46,439
so yeah Mila and I in 2014 uh almost

18
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:49,199
died in a boat accident on the bay uh my

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,019
good friend who's since passed Gordon uh

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,120
Jones he was uh the captain of a

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,219
sailboat we were on a 35-foot sailboat

22
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,919
and there was only two boats out on the

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,460
bay and the wind picked up and somehow

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,159
we went for a head-on and ended up

25
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,960
almost crashing yeah and it was so lucky

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,820
because all those boats have all these

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,280
pieces of wood sticking out to no

28
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,679
directions I know these ropes waving

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,019
around in that wind and nothing caught

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,580
yeah we were lucky that we were so lucky

31
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:19,439
yeah we had some really good food

32
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,118

so yeah so I guess let's go back uh to

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,820
the beginning and I guess we can talk

49
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,640
about the difference between cannabis

50
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,139
and hash and how you got started with uh

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,219
cannabis

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,618
I got started with cannabis in 1964 in

53
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,899
Amsterdam at that time there were no

54
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,239
coffee shops there was no weed to be

55
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,639
found anywhere but if you went down to

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,060
the harbor there'd be pubs that had been

57
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,318
buying ash from Sailors and you could

58
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,840
get it from them

59
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,299
so I started smoking hash

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,860
actually the same way as I do now with a

61
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,379
little bit of tobacco

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,920
this is 58 years later

63
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:31,500
so I started smoking ice and um

64
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:35,280
that was it and then later I traveled

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,800
Easton saw several countries like that

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,239
are famous for their hash like

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,000
Afghanistan Pakistan

68
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,319
Nepal

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,019
so

70
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,238
I knew it was out there and in all those

71
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,180
countries they only small cash nobody

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,878
smokes wheat at all so for the whole

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,420
duration I was there I smoked Ash

74
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:00,000
came back to Amsterdam 18 years later

75
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:02,759
full of coffee shops full of wheat well

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,680
I tried about three times but after 20

77
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,579
years of house smoking

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,680
it didn't serve me nice so the hash

79
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,599
extraction in the 60s and even before

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,819
then there's several ways they were

81
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,098
doing it around the world yeah

82
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:19,318
um but it's the resin so we're talking

83
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,060
about resin crystals yeah that are on

84
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,539
the plant and they're extracted either

85
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,140
using a a sieving method uh like dry

86
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,479
sift dry sift out for a screen or

87
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,939
there's areas where they rub the buds

88
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,459
like the Charis the Charis and then

89
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,739
scrape it off their hand Palms yep yeah

90
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,319
yeah so I'd seen all this happening

91
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,539
right there not that I was uh

92
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,339
I always felt I was just a recreational

93
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:48,658
smoker yeah yeah and so you've had some

94
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,939
Adventures you've written an amazing

95
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:52,859
book it's about that thick it'll take

96
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,060
about two years to read but it's really

97
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,519
amazing and there's some really good

98
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,140
stories in there it took me 11 years to

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,759
ride it so wow yeah yeah so how was it

100
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,158
like Afghanistan the the different

101
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,079
hashes I mean they bred specifically for

102
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,120
those hash varieties that they had in

103
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,980
Afghanistan and Pakistan and other

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,819
places like that for hundreds of years

105
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:17,519
if not longer yeah so I don't think they

106
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,238
cared much about what it looked smelt or

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,060
whatever so long as it made good hash

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:26,339
and uh the circumstances in Afghanistan

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,620
for instance are quite wild I heard

110
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,899
there of one Village that they just got

111
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,540
a big rainstorm once a year everybody

112
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:36,478
Runs Out plants the seeds and that's

113
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,819
that's all the water it gets but I do

114
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,180
know from experience that the cannabis

115
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:45,418
plant can create Deep Roots if it needs

116
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,639
to six meters what is that 20 feet or

117
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,799
something yeah yeah there's nothing yeah

118
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,900
pretty wild yeah

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,060
so yeah and so they get one rain a year

120
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,719
and then you get and they all gotta rush

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,399
out to get everything in interesting

122
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,800
so yeah and then how about hiking

123
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,019
through the Himalayas you saw Wild Wild

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,020
cannabis growing feral feral cannabis

125
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,879
that was growing indigenously yeah we

126
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:11,519
saw that in the Himalayas but the place

127
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,439
to go for that is Kazakhstan there are

128
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,740
one million two hundred hectares of wild

129
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,500
marijuana wow yeah so several different

130
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,199
kinds that are Regional

131
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,199
uh yeah and I wouldn't be surprised if

132
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:29,160
originally it was very good smokable

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,680
cannabis but at that time um Kazakhstan

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,759
belonged to Russia and I think Stalin

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,579
saw how China made all these clothes for

136
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,439
everybody in China out of hemp and then

137
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,560
he must have thought oh I got a big

138
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:46,680
Campfield or marijuana field and he

139
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,120
probably planted hemp among it so by the

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,038
time I got there the THC wasn't exciting

141
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,180
and there was quite a lot of CBD in it

142
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:59,038
yeah wow well how did it look dude so it

143
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,840
didn't have like the the trade like the

144
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,300
the structure that we know now it was

145
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,000
more bushy or were they taller and they

146
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,280
were taller and basically there was a

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,740
red stem variety and a green stemmed

148
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,899
variety and they were either really the

149
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,660
one or the other yeah there was no like

150
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,519
mixes well so people that smoked hash

151
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,919
they did they use those for hash at all

152
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,240
or they're just grown wild is almost an

153
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,719
ornamental

154
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,939
oh they just grow wild like uh other

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,060
places of pampas grass and growing wild

156
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:33,959
yeah no grass yeah it's not cultivated

157
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:37,740
in any way and at the time I was there

158
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:40,198
it wasn't illegal to uh uh have in small

159
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,840
cash but it didn't look very popular

160
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,560
even among the young people I didn't

161
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,060
meet many people that smoked there but

162
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,120
so out of all the countries you've been

163
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,800
who smokes the most who smokes the most

164
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,439
who smokes the most

165
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,720
I wouldn't be surprised it's America and

166
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,060
that's also because they dab and it

167
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,220
takes a lot of flour to make a good dab

168
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,839
yeah yeah

169
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,940
well so you've been doing the dabado for

170
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,879
over 10 years now yeah it's an event

171
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,879
where the it's judged on extract and you

172
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,839
have some categories yeah we have a dry

173
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,500
safe category uh ice water hash

174
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,918
um

175
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,139
rosin extracts that's basically a snow

176
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,959
uh weed in there I always felt there's

177
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,598
enough cups that have weed that might be

178
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,818
something different seeing as I Never

179
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,978
Smoke Weed anyway right

180
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,740
to avoid it completely yeah that's

181
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:37,019
that's the way to go so we went to a

182
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,579
Heritage hash company yeah and so

183
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,198
Heritage they have a dispensary up there

184
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,899
and here it's Belle's Place yeah

185
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,879
Frenchy's Apprentice yeah and they have

186
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,739
amazing stuff they do really good work

187
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,779
and they give us some samples so they

188
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,180
won with the white horn Rose at Emerald

189
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,879
Cup last year in the solventless extract

190
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,098
category first place okay so yeah and

191
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,079
it's really exciting to see you know how

192
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,519
it's progressed How do you feel how it's

193
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,899
progressed from the time you first saw

194
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,818
hash to where it is now with things like

195
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,519
rosin where they're actually making

196
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:08,340
bubble hash yeah

197
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,279
um and then president it does definitely

198
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,198
Advanced a lot I mean when I started

199
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,198
making us we didn't even never even

200
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,120
heard about terpenes or cannabinoids we

201
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,160
just wanted to make something get too

202
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,918
high but

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,099
um so the knowledge also of people have

204
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:29,038
has increased out of a lot people throw

205
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,000
on language that is nearly Abracadabra

206
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,519
to me

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,918
and have another a lot more knowledge

208
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,620
about what's going on there's a lot more

209
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,519
technological advancement

210
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,519
and

211
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,639
I think that's a good thing because

212
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,399
anything if it doesn't grow it dies so

213
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,439
if making hash grows that makes me very

214
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,899
happy and I can understand they don't

215
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,580
know you don't want to use my method but

216
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,620
the fact that it's growing and it's

217
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,839
caught on it's become part of many

218
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,839
people's lives yeah I find that's

219
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,320
perfect for me as far as I know hash is

220
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,660
the essence of the plant so yeah

221
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,580
yeah so you were a part of all this

222
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,379
technology actually with the pollinator

223
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,339
yeah you know the pollinator's been

224
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:22,200
around for almost 30 years now yeah so

225
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,980
and it's a dry tumbler it was the first

226
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,339
dry tumbler yeah that was uh I was when

227
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,759
I came back to Holland I was uh growing

228
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,339
and um so I had the material so I

229
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,740
decided to make my own hash and then

230
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:40,019
started real Afghan Style on a flat

231
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,220
screen and kind of waffling the material

232
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,679
around

233
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,379
until one night I stood quite stoned in

234
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,778
front of my clothes dryer well it closed

235
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,179
dry and they're all tumbling around

236
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:53,278
and that was in one moment that it

237
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:56,579
changed my life because I thought how

238
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,399
about making the flat screen round right

239
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,680
and we did and that was the first

240
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,720
mechanical system to separate the

241
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,479
trichomes yeah I mean people have been

242
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,980
doing it by hand for longest time yeah

243
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,740
and you've been selling them all over

244
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,839
the world yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's

245
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,700
been a great thing yeah so it's it's

246
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,220
funny and then you know the technology

247
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,720
is just stacked over the last you know

248
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,399
it's grown exponentially since

249
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,800
especially since the 90s because I feel

250
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,179
like before the 90s it was you know they

251
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,979
were doing some stuff in the 70s even

252
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,979
because I remember I bought a book in

253
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,800
Berkeley off Telegraph Avenue that was

254
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,480
you know they had a reflux apparatus and

255
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,399
stuff to make you know honey oil and

256
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,320
stuff like that yeah yeah so so hash

257
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,480
back in the day the hash extraction so

258
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,540
they understood it a little bit but then

259
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,100
really uh you know Kenny Morrow and

260
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,019
people like Kenny from tricome

261
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,720
technologies have really you know with

262
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,839
butane extraction and everything else

263
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,700
that he's done like it's it's just it's

264
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,100
amazing where it's at right now and the

265
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,740
quality I mean it's just I liked bubble

266
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,720
hash back in the 90s and early 2000s and

267
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,820
then now we have this rosin that's just

268
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,240
incredible yeah yeah so in these hassles

269
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,000
some of this modern stuff I find uh too

270
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,700
strong for me yeah it's like smoking a

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,980
whole uh uh spliff in one talk like with

272
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,660
the dabbing yeah that's not what I think

273
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,820
somewhere so when you're looking at how

274
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,799
do you want to smoke what what are the

275
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,079
qualifiers what what do you put in order

276
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,179
do you effect is the most important the

277
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,099
flavor no the effect that's the most

278
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,599
important

279
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,259
um

280
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,759
the flavor also the consistency yeah

281
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,559
yeah

282
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,319
and you like I like it when you can

283
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,539
crumble it still yeah yeah so I made

284
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,459
some some hash three years ago that when

285
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:42,539
you came here I gave you my real and you

286
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,099
ended up really liking the

287
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,539
three-year-old house which it's been in

288
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,879
the freezer so it's not like it's been

289
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,919
sitting out for three years yeah and no

290
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,139
no and I like it very much because it's

291
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,360
so smooth I've been coughing so much

292
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,778
less since I've been smoking that Ash of

293
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,659
yours it's wonderful yeah that's great

294
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:02,220
yeah and you just I had so much of it at

295
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,620
one point and I gave a whole bunch of it

296
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,660
away and then I saved the best of it and

297
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,659
I've kept it I'm glad I kept it I'm glad

298
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,278
I held under it me too so yeah

299
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,199
so yeah we have some different things we

300
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,759
got these hash holes so hash holes are a

301
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,740
new thing I mean they're not super new

302
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,600
people have been putting hash in joints

303
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,700
forever yeah but the households are

304
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,519
where you put they call them Donuts or

305
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,700
hash holes uh Sam from rosin Tech gave

306
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,820
me and Mila gave us some hash holes in a

307
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,778
box set and uh they have the hash in the

308
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,579
middle

309
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,278
so you get

310
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,899
super high

311
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,278
this is a little one right here so it's

312
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,940
it's a stubby

313
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:43,259
but uh glass tip and then they put the

314
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,639
the hash in the middle and then they

315
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,539
roll it around it and it burns like a

316
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,100
donut

317
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,379
so we're I'm actually gonna smoke this

318
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,379
right now Camille is going to smoke it

319
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,000
with me just kidding I'll take a toke

320
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,799
yeah yeah yeah

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,899
and so yeah this is the evolution

322
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,099
contains a lot of weed as well it

323
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,139
contains a lot of weed and they're

324
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,000
really strong it's not my personal

325
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,339
preference I prefer if I'm gonna do a

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,740
dab I'd like to do a dab or you know

327
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,480
whatever if we're taking hits out of a

328
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,600
vaporizer or anything else like that I

329
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,879
like I like my weed in joints uh and I

330
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,259
like dabs in rigs or something like that

331
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,120
where they're separate and they have

332
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,679
different effects yeah and I feel like

333
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,039
if I get used to smoking joints all the

334
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,319
time my tolerance for dabs is very uh

335
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,179
very low yeah and then same thing if I'm

336
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,620
doing if Dad go through periods where I

337
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,699
do lots of dabs then I go to smoke a

338
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,000
joint and all of a sudden it gets me

339
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,680
high maybe that's why these dabs the few

340
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,778
times that I've tried it have kind of

341
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,159
knocked me out yeah

342
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:40,919
for sure

343
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,740
so Amsterdam I spent a lot of time in

344
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,559

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,480
actually

391
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:31,620
I used to go as a kid to Austria and we

392
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,839
used to pick them oh wow so uh as far as

393
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,578
Afghanistan and Pakistan

394
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,100
you spend a lot of time there did you

395
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:41,039
live in no I didn't really live in

396
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,879
either country I was on my way to India

397
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,740
but uh

398
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:49,500
Afghanistan and afghanist was my

399
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,379
definite most favorite yeah in all the

400
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,120
time I lived out in India yeah yeah

401
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,399
what what do you like about the most is

402
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,179
the smooth taste and effect

403
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:04,980
yeah and it has uh yeah for me very nice

404
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:08,399
I I'm done yeah that was great I mean

405
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,019
probably now you have Western

406
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,820
um

407
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,980
uh marijuanas that will get you higher

408
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,459
maybe than that one in that time but for

409
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,560
that time it was the best by far well

410
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,179
and so you also did a lot of hiking in

411
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,679
the Himalayas and up through those

412
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,638
mountain ridges and you'd hike 20 miles

413
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,219
a day

414
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,778
yeah yeah at the beginning yeah at the

415
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,660
end of the hike it would build up to

416
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,820
nearly 50. wow yeah but then we'd be

417
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:34,740
walking for a few months and your body

418
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,860
just becomes a walking machine yeah you

419
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,320
have no body fat and hairstyle girls you

420
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,240

events with everything nowhere to be

435
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,859

436
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,380
special breed yeah he's one of those

437
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,639
guys that when he tells you he's gonna

438
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,740
do something it might not sound crazy

439
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,240
easy but then he goes and does it yes

440
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,700
and it's a lot of times it's over the

441
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,620
top and it's like holy [ __ ] yeah but now

442
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,120
he does he does what he says and that's

443
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:36,298
what he says and he's very Innovative

444
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,819
and and very like anybody else and very

445
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:41,940
creative when things go wrong our team

446
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,859
finally solve the problems yeah you have

447
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,240
to be really good at problem solving

448
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:47,579
when you're putting on events like the

449
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,740
size of events he puts on yeah but he

450
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,259
seems to reinvent himself pretty

451
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,419
regularly and fearless yeah completely

452
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,879
Fearless you know he did some music a

453
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,400
while back yeah you know he released an

454
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,960
album and you know with chalice yeah and

455
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,480
with all his events and with Hitman

456
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,519
Glass I mean he's glass yeah reinvention

457
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,679
that's how I first met him it was at the

458
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,918
High Times cup I forget where it was in

459
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,820
in the states and he had this amazing

460
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,520
um

461
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,619
uh smoking whether it's like a table

462
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:19,740
made of glass and then it was like a

463
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,558
hookah that like four different

464
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,259
um what do you call come out yeah to

465
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,720
talk on the mouthpieces yes and it was

466
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:30,359
just a beautiful piece of glass and then

467
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,720
it turned out he'd uh just created a

468
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,759
book and chess and it was the I think

469
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,579
the best book I had seen yeah with all

470
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,200
the hand blown chest glass pieces yeah

471
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:42,418
everyone's so different and the quality

472
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,940
was great yeah I realized that also

473
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:46,919
about him he goes for Quality he goes

474
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,620
for Quality he understands quality he

475
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,799
appreciates quality yeah and in this

476
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:55,979
market you have to have quality yeah

477
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,918
maybe 10 years ago you could get by on

478
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,660
on volume as an individual but I think

479
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,740
really if you want to be competitive in

480
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,259
this market you have to have good

481
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,240
quality whether it's a hash yeah uh you

482
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,099
know flower genetics all these things

483
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,980
play a role and I mean it's it's

484
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,899
important to have the best quality yeah

485
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,779
especially genetics so yeah starting

486
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,720
with good seeds well people ask me uh

487
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,879
tips for uh making us I always say the

488
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,360
first three ones are good genetics and

489
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,380
good genetics and good genetics yeah

490
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,819
without that you'll never make

491
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,500
Kardashians

492
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:30,538
yeah I mean it's the starting point

493
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,460
without the genetics you can't get past

494
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,740
that part you have you know now we have

495
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,480
viruses and feroids all these things

496
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,038
that we're aware of these pathogens that

497
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,298
are affecting crops like heavily

498
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:43,919
affecting crops and uh you know even

499
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:46,259
with good genetics if you have those

500
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,660
problems you know but you gotta start

501
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,640
somewhere yeah you gotta start somewhere

502
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,200
and the other tip I give is not be

503
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,360
greedy because everything you've

504
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,500
collected more is what you didn't want

505
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:01,259
to right yeah so how many dabadus have

506
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,419
you done now oh I think about 36 now

507
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,679
it's amazing yeah yeah I've never

508
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,299
thought it would happen like that

509
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,640
because there was just going to be a

510
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:12,058
one-time Affair I was just gonna do it

511
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,559
once it was my 69th birthday so okay I

512
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:16,200
gotta do something

513
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,418
but everybody liked it so much four

514
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,860
months later we had one in Barcelona and

515
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:25,020
it's just been going since the yeah yeah

516
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:28,439
last fall I did a trip through South

517
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:31,379
America uh stayed in eight countries and

518
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,160
had seven Dapper dues actually and it

519
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:37,559
was just amazing and I really like to

520
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,660
like it there you know we had like glass

521
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:42,558
blowers that would follow us along for

522
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,480
three or four Dabba Doos or other people

523
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:49,619
uh you'd meet in Uruguay that had come

524
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,259
from Colombia or Costa Rica

525
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:56,759
yeah yeah we we tried we started in

526
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:57,839
Brazil Uruguay Argentina Chile

527
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,339
um

528
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:04,798
Barrel yeah Mexico Costa Rica and we

529
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,720
ended in Colombia and I had my Dapper

530
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,418
dude there on the beach at my birthday

531
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,519
so that was very nice fantastic yeah

532
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:14,460
yeah people in South America are very

533
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,740
passionate about extract and yeah about

534
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,558
cannabis in general like embodying the

535
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,599
whole lifestyle yeah and uh yeah I was

536
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:24,240
there three years earlier to uh have

537
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,038
some diaper dudes on the quality and the

538
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,319
amount and the interest that's what

539
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:31,079
really so much really impressed me is

540
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,000
the quality yeah even in Mexico where

541
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:34,439
you know I think coming from America we

542
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,659
Mexico was like oh that's where the

543
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,240
shitty weed comes from yeah but going

544
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,740
there a year and a half ago it opened my

545
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,940
eyes up the quality has gotten a lot

546
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,038
better they're bringing in genetics from

547
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,900
the United States also good or bad but

548
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,179
like they have some really amazing

549
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,340
blends of some Mexican stuff that I've

550
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,740
seen and some oaxacan stuff that was

551
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,480
really good and you know I mean a lot of

552
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,940
the good stuff came from Mexico too I

553
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,298
think uh people don't give enough credit

554
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,580
to the the the genetics that have come

555
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:04,500
out of that that area Colombia Santa

556
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:07,558
Marta all these you know these are

557
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,359
amazing amazing genetics that that we're

558
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,099
using even today and I really like

559
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,259
Mexico and South America and the passion

560
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,879
I mean Spanish people too Spanish people

561
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:16,798
I mean I think we have passionate people

562
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,840
all over the world yeah it's just

563
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,179
amazing how passionate people are you

564
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:24,119
know no I really that's such a good time

565
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,860
there it was wonderful yeah sometimes

566
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,359
like a Magical Mystery Tour you know

567
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:31,740
idea where you'd be sleeping the next

568
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:34,500
night but that was okay too nice yeah

569
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,319
it's always an adventure yes so with the

570
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,679
dabba do you typically get like uh 50

571
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,779
entries 20 to 50 entries normally we get

572
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:46,919
between

573
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:50,339
maybe 18 and 25 okay going up to 30.

574
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:53,460
yeah 35 Max except for in Chile Where

575
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:55,259
there were 110. yeah that's pretty

576
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,360
amazing but he had gotten permission to

577
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,000
add weed to his things but that was

578
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:04,339
pretty amazing that was a wonderful uh

579
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,099
dabado out in the nature and yeah yeah

580
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:10,079
nature sounds fun yes Italy have you

581
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,759
been to Italy you've gone to Italy at

582
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,899
all I've been to Italy but not with it

583
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:18,658
yeah yeah but with the hash no I did uh

584
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,298
one of our I was taking part in the kind

585
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:25,620
of his cycle tour to raise money for

586
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:28,500
medical wow purpose and one of them

587
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:30,538
ended in Italy yeah well Italians love

588
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,140
their hash yeah I feel like my Italian

589
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:36,240
friends and the Spanish Spanish yeah

590
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,159
yeah the people love hash all over you

591
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,019
can't just really isolate one but my

592
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,840
friends that are Italian yeah they like

593
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:45,720
hash more than weed and certainly once

594
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:47,459
you get to Turkey and eats the vet I

595
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,220
don't know maybe in the southern regions

596
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,819
you'd find some weed like in Thailand or

597
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:58,220
India even but all the way from Turkey

598
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,220
to China there's more cash wow

599
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:02,699
yeah China China still they still have

600
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,859
people that smell cash in China it's

601
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,759
super illegal there but yeah

602
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:11,459
I've done a couple of pollinators there

603
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:15,798
that's funny and not to the factory

604
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,798
that's gonna copy them right hopefully

605
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,360
but that's happened before too I think

606
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,780
yeah you know with everything and yeah

607
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:27,119
with technology and time yeah this is

608
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,960
really good does hash hole taste great

609
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,219
um sometimes hash holes

610
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,440
yeah it's it's actually really good and

611
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,000
that's probably the the perfect point of

612
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,519
tasting it I think we burned it down and

613
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,079
everything just fine you know the good

614
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:44,158
flavor from the hash

615
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,899
and uh yeah it's nice

616
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,120
super smooth I mean it doesn't hurt my

617
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,798
throat it's not affecting my

618
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,298
that's right the high is nice and clean

619
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,960
from it

620
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:56,158
it's not bad not bad at all

621
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,720
yeah the [ __ ] is more of a modern

622
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,700
name for it it's you know but that's

623
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,259
it's really trendy that's the big trendy

624
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,240
thing right now

625
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,099
and some people make big households

626
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,240
where they put like four grams of flour

627
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:12,379
and do a gram of rosin or a gram of

628
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,380
hasha there

629
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,918
they're good for parties but this has a

630
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,659
really nice Oil ring around it it's

631
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,679
burning nice and even though the ash is

632
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:24,140
white

633
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,140
in the center if you guys can get that

634
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,100
but uh

635
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:28,099
yeah

636
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,599
so our good friend Soma is heading in a

637
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:36,000
word uh for I believe it's uh breeders

638
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,619
Hall of Fame for Emerald cup he can't

639
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,538
come to the states to get the award but

640
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,939
I'll bring it back for him if it's not

641
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,379
too big yeah

642
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,538
so yeah it's almost a good friend

643
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,299
someone's uh we're both good friends

644
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:50,158
we've gone in here with Soma and Ed

645
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,859
I think Ed will be by in a little bit

646
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,020
but yeah it's it's a character yeah and

647
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:57,479
uh yeah I think we've had some crazy

648
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,819
conversations between the four of us in

649
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,079
Amsterdam before at uh Golden Temple

650
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:02,759
yeah

651
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,399
my favorite restaurants over there where

652
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:07,619
you get to sit on the floor and

653
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,038
I don't know I'm a home cooker I don't

654
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:13,259
go much to restaurants yeah yeah yeah

655
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,658
yeah I mean when I travel there's no uh

656

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:05,940
jumping into uh talking about the the

677
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:09,659
achievements over the last UH 60 70s 80

678
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,880
years of achievements

679
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,880
um you know I think being a woman the

680
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,000
biggest achievement in my mind is your

681
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,100
success being a woman at the time when

682
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,900
you're a woman in Amsterdam you know

683
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,599
it's it's a competitive market as it is

684
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,059
but it's it's a man's world the industry

685
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,240
you had to be tough yeah you know I have

686
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:33,240
uh my aunt who she was in the Cannabis

687
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,579
industry you know growing yeah back in

688
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,038
the day she's she's another one and it's

689
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,839
like it's a very competitive world and

690
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:41,519
there's very few women that actually

691
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,139
break break through and be successful

692
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,278
there's a lot of people that try it and

693
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,900
you know there's been women that have

694
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,599
been successful but you are one of the

695
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,980
pioneers of that so then you've shown a

696
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,359
lot of people I believe that you were

697
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,380
one of the first that shown a lot of the

698
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,918
people in the industry here in

699
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,840
California hashmakers yeah

700
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,038
people like that seeing you do it and I

701
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,579
think that's one of the biggest things

702
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,079
yeah yeah yeah so and the pollinator I

703
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,259
mean being able to do the pollinator and

704
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,058
being successful in business yes yes and

705
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:10,259
you still sell them you still sell them

706
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,480
and you got your home yeah 30 years

707
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,038

709
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,599
way a lot of fun along the way a lot of

710
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,600
fun along the way I didn't start the

711
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:24,058
business until I was 50. so I already

712
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,038
had a lot of fun yeah and I'm very glad

713
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:29,460
actually it turned out like that that I

714
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:32,579

him three times in first grade

737
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:30,979
and now he's a PhD and he's a oh let me

738
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:34,319
say this correctly uh computational

739
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:37,500
pharmaceutical chemist wow and he just

740
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,898
got his first patent for some medicine

741
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,000
for blood cancer

742
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:45,298
I tried to tell him he could get a good

743
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,058
job with uh marijuana but he likes to

744
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:51,079
invent compounds and then knowing to

745
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:53,579
which receptors he goes they go

746
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,558
Egan works like that oh anyway that's

747
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:57,418
how he tries to explain it to his mom

748
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:59,579
right

749
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:02,360
well that's wonderful

750
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:06,000
the household hit me that's how it works

751
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:09,359
and where the effects work

752
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,220
um yeah so in the states when did you

753
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,798
start coming over for cannabis events I

754
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,140
guess in the 2001 2010 when they first

755
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,839
started with that cup or did you travel

756
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,480
around here before it all I'm trying to

757
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,398
remember when I first came here

758
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,640
um I had a friend who used to work for

759
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:29,278
High Times on Eureka and she wrote the

760
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,100
first article about the pollinator for

761
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,798
High Times and

762
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:37,678
and Jen wrote another one yeah but that

763
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:41,220
was uh later yeah she started though a

764
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,399
screen now right yes her article just

765
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,679
had on one page Queen yeah more or less

766
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:49,678
but

767
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,600
um and he introduced the pollinator and

768
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,640
there was a few years later I can't

769
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,519
really you know when you get older your

770
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,880
memory yeah

771
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:02,220
dates change times yeah names change

772
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,380
it was a few years after I came out to

773
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,500
the pollinator yeah yeah

774
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,000
so the mid 90s sometime yeah

775
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,380
so yeah and you make different sizes

776
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,880
with the pollinator and you start out

777
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,278
with the smaller size and then you got

778
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,580
the big commercial size yeah now we go

779
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:21,058
got one that's good for 11 pounds five

780
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:23,879
kilos anyway so I think that's yeah

781
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:26,220
pretty wild and we're building a newer

782
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,020
version of the forever

783
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,259
but that's stuck knitting a little bit

784
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,599
but we'll get there I mean the idea was

785
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:36,298
forever like in the other ones you throw

786
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,939
the material inside the drum and it

787
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:40,259
turns and the forever is open-ended at

788
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,778
both sides

789
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:45,658
so we used to have another model before

790
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,700
and I saw them quite a lot to South

791
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:50,100
America and I always said as long as you

792
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,778
have someone to shovel it'll work oh

793
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:54,058
nice yeah they just shoveled it in one

794
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:55,859
end yeah it goes through and then comes

795
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:58,859
out the other end yeah yeah

796
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:01,500
and that one you could put into uh

797
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,599
positions and one it would take about

798
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,579
three minutes to get through there so

799
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,639
that was like a First Quality and the

800
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:10,678
other 15 to 20 minutes so in much slower

801
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,659
yeah so he'd get more but it was really

802
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,880
more higher yield but there's a lot more

803
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,580
plant material in there not so much that

804
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,039
yet depends on the temperature you're

805
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:21,720
using your machine right and some people

806
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,700
used to use dry ice in the machines I'm

807
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,200
not sure if they still do that but I

808
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,120
don't know I don't know how they would

809
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,460
do that because we tried one time but

810
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,619
then the whole screen gets wet so the

811
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,659
Chris the attack Combs don't fall

812
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,538
through you gotta do it in a cold room I

813
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:39,299
guess I'm not I'm not sure

814
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:41,759
we uh made bags for um

815
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:44,700
dry ice and we had some demonstrations

816
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,440
in some one time at the High Times when

817
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,100
they were the last one they did in

818
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,200
Amsterdam yeah and I don't know you know

819
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:54,359
the first 30

820
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,120
seconds to a minute maybe it's okay

821
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:59,699
you've just got the trichomes but

822
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,798
because all the material is so cold yeah

823
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,000
the leaves are gonna start breaking up

824
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,398
and so

825
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,079
after a minute for me maybe it's okay

826
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,959
for butter or cooking but not for

827
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,759
smoking anymore right yeah

828
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,380
yeah so when somebody asks you what your

829
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,879
flavor is what are you usually your

830
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,080
favorite flavor

831
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,080
that's right yeah

832
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:25,079
because all the other ones are past and

833
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:28,319
future but they're up in the air and I

834
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:32,639
kind of grew up in the uh age when I

835
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:34,619
live here now right counted and uh

836
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,299
you know I know so it's so difficult

837
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,459
especially if I'd come to the states

838
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:42,058
every time I come back there's at least

839
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,919
100 new names so you know it take me a

840
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:46,200
whole year to try them all which one I'd

841
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,940
like best yeah yeah notice how she said

842
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,640
names because there's a lot of renaming

843
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,519
going on but

844
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:56,038
well whether they're renaming or whether

845
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,659
the names come out of new crosses and

846
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:00,000
whatever and there are a lot of new

847
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,399
products and the style changes slowly

848
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,380
over time you know we went from but it's

849
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,479
impossible for me to really from all

850
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,460
this what's being grown and produced

851
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,300
here to say which one for me is the best

852
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:15,539
yeah so this one right now yeah until

853
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,460
there's a next one yeah so coffee shops

854
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,619
in Amsterdam you saw the coffee shops

855
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,440
involved or evolve into what they are

856
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:24,240
now and it's changed because five years

857
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,740
ago the red light was much bigger and

858
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,079
there was more coffee shops yeah yeah

859
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:30,598
but you closed but in slowly over time

860
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,619
how many years did it take to get where

861
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:38,119
it was in its peak

862
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:43,379
I think maybe between

863
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:46,740
91 and 94 was really its peak wow

864
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:49,559
um I have a collection of newspaper

865
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:53,519
headings and all of them the police

866
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:56,219
support legalization of marijuana

867
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,380
um all kind of in that way so everybody

868
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:02,879
was expecting it to be illegal you know

869
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,800
by 94.95 yeah and then I don't know I

870
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,680
guess we just vote drunk because even

871
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,079
after 40 Years of coffee shops and is

872
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,419
tolerated to sell in the coffee shops

873
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,900
and they love to get their percentage of

874
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:19,200
taxes but it is illegal to grow for the

875
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,358
top coffee shops so this is just typical

876
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,699
Dutch hypocrisy or something I don't

877
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,480
know where it came from and that after

878
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:28,618
40 years they still don't see any sense

879
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,838
although now they have this new

880
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,000
government program and what I heard

881
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:35,219
about it they're going to grow four

882
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,739
kinds of weed and one of them is CBD

883
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:40,078
weed and that's it and then supposedly

884
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,358
in their idea all the coffee Surfers are

885
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,820
going to sell that well I can't imagine

886
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:47,279
that that's going to work out so you

887
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,380
know it's the it's the diversity that

888
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,359
the coffee shops have that's what makes

889
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,519
it not if all of them sell the same form

890
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,619
yeah people aren't going to get excited

891
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,320
about that no nobody's gonna it's not

892
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,980
gonna work anyway they spent several

893
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,480
Millions on it to get this up and going

894
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,338
yeah and everybody knows it's not going

895
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,838
to work right but they're still doing it

896
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:09,119
because they're able to grow legally you

897
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,099
know I think there's some some truth to

898
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,300
that but the the politics over there are

899
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,280
so strange it seems like every other

900
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,560
year every couple years they talk about

901
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,019
banning it or they talk about they're

902
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,239
going to expand on it yeah and then well

903
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:23,579
I'm not expanding on it hasn't been like

904
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,259
that for a long time and the most recent

905
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,539
you lie is that you're not allowed to

906
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,180
walk through the red light district in

907
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:32,880
Amsterdam anymore holding a spliff or

908
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:35,639
anything yeah and

909
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,220
you know it's not the smokers that Creo

910
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:40,319
deliver create the noise and the fights

911
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:41,819
and the yelling and the screaming we all

912
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
know that's what people are drinking

913
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,990
right so

914
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,059
yeah

915
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:48,059
[Music]

916
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:55,500
Rowdy but yeah there's a few we've even

917
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,060
made naps and I was even made hands to

918
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,059
discourage British people

919
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,019
I have some really good British friends

920
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,460
yeah yeah

921
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:07,679
but especially the underwear and so

922
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,260
notorious for being loud and Rowdy and

923
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:14,039
Rowdy yeah a lot of Rowdy yep Rowdy

924
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:16,920
stuff so in 2013 at the High Times

925
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,619
Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam

926
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,180
you were the only one arrested oh yeah

927
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,338
the cops came in and raided the place

928
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:24,838
yeah and uh I can't do you remember what

929
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:25,799
they were yelling the people when they

930
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:27,380
were yelling I didn't have pills

931
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,180
pineapples yeah

932
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,740
suddenly and I don't know I certainly

933
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:34,199
was looking around what the hell

934
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:36,239
pineapples what are they on this and

935
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,819
then in the distance I saw the cops

936
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,699
walking out the big aisle to Center Ohio

937
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,579
yeah yeah of course they they arrest the

938
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:46,858
the little lady

939
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:50,700
well the thing was that uh we were

940
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:52,799
demonstrating the isolator I think

941
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:55,819
um but we've been demonstrating that

942
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,980
isolated more or less with the same

943
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:02,280
material I think you know it wasn't like

944
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,500
that every new run was new material it

945
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,380
just ran out just for people to see what

946
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,280
happened yeah and so but we did have a

947
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:14,700
couple of bags next to it to change it

948
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,680
and that was more than 500 grams I said

949
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:19,939
and now is the first time I ever heard

950
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:24,078
that I was even allowed 500 grams

951
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:27,240
and uh yeah that took me with me

952
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,820
and I asked them yeah that was just

953
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,858
crazy because once I came in it became

954
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,619
clear that everybody who left there

955
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:36,838
would have to give up whatever they had

956
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:39,539
in their pockets so you'd look towards

957
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,719
the entrance and there was this gigantic

958
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:44,579
Cloud coming up

959
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,919
hi everybody let's try to smoke it

960
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,440
before they got to the door yeah they

961
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,940
had a big garbage garbage can yeah they

962
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,320
were supposed to do stuff that everybody

963
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,539
was supposed to throw their stuff into

964
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,220
yeah and I believe Ariane is the one

965
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:57,480
that said Shaker bear if he bailed you

966
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:01,679
out for uh

967
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,559
that event I think beforehand but the

968
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:07,078
problem was that this location was not

969
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:10,199
inside the city of Amsterdam so they had

970
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,900
to ask this kind of other town for

971
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:15,299
permission to do it and yeah

972
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,220
High Times for I didn't pay enough money

973
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,440
I don't know if it was that or whether

974
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:21,239
it was just the wrong City where they

975
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,099
didn't like what was going on in them

976
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,379
with all the coffee shops and everything

977
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,720
and then the more Bourgeois people

978
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,119
living there yes it sounded good on

979
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,618
paper until it happened and then it was

980
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,920
pretty wild though I think people were

981
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:38,039
really spooked yeah yeah yeah that took

982
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,780
me to the police station but it didn't

983
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,699
take more than three four hours and I

984
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,359
could go home again and I never ever

985
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:47,219
heard anything about it so yeah

986
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,719
yeah those High Times events the cups

987
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,000
were really good they were a lot of fun

988
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,459
yeah yeah so the Amsterdam ones but it's

989
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,659
like disco once it's gone it's gone you

990
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,760
could never do it quite the same again

991
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:59,098
yeah no probably not

992
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,480
so yeah I met some friends that I a lot

993
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:02,460
of friends that I'm still friends with

994
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,960
yeah so at those events from all over

995
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,338
the world and

996
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,960
so and seeing all kinds of different

997
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:09,480
stuff seeing different hash different

998
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,639
flower hot sauce from my friend from

999
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,679
Trinidad you know every we ended up

1000
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,259
getting hot sauce every year and

1001
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,759
Franco's left us but he leaves behind

1002
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,280
his legacy and he's very passionate

1003
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,560
about cannabis yes yes that was very sad

1004
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:27,359
I liked him a lot he was actually the

1005
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:31,500
one when Ariana won his umpteenth hash

1006
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,900
cop he handed it to me Franco nice yes

1007
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,199
he gave you the cup he gave me the cup

1008
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,539
yeah yeah he was quite the character oh

1009
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,480
so I'm sorry I think they both gave it a

1010
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:44,338
cup and then I found out later that it

1011
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,619
wasn't their cup to give away in the

1012
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,358
first place

1013
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:51,900
he was quite the character yeah yeah

1014
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:53,819
those guys yeah good times Franco was

1015
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,380
always so passionate about winning and

1016
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,320
he could roll the biggest yeah he rolled

1017
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,240
these joints that were this long and he

1018
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,599
was always fun to be around oh very much

1019
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,639
he was very very loving kankai yes I

1020
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,820
liked him a lot and then of course uh

1021
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,940
Frenchie and a couple of weeks ago they

1022
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,059
had this showing of this uh

1023
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,380
I think it was called Frenchy dreams of

1024
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,779
hashish

1025
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,599
and the idea was that all over the world

1026
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,700
people could watch the movie at the same

1027
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,380
time and then we'd all do a zoom

1028
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:27,299
together after well I was different

1029
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,940
divided in different time zones and

1030
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,859
Europe was one time zone North and South

1031
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,838
America one oh they had one in France

1032
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:36,358
too and they had one in Paris and in

1033
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:38,279
Germany London yeah but we had several

1034
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,380
people from Paris come up to ours to

1035
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,300
watch it I've been from Germany because

1036
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,220
they knew where and Amsterdam at least

1037
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,039
they could Mark smoke while they were

1038
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:49,199
watching right we did it in the Cannabis

1039
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,019
college and that was very nice because

1040
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:56,578
first we were going to do it in a

1041
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:59,159
um the coffee shop there and but then he

1042
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,380
said it's the biggest uh most busy day

1043
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,420
and the most busy time seven o'clock in

1044
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,280
the evening so I was imagining standing

1045
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,260
at the door and there's 200 people

1046
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,260
trying to get in and you have to figure

1047
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:13,020
out the ones which are coming to see the

1048
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,900
movie right so it was great we could do

1049
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:19,079
it in cannabis college and we just put

1050
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,599
out uh the message brings stuff to share

1051
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,599
and that was amazing we had so many

1052
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,420
Edibles and everything it was just it

1053
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,480
was a really nice party yes yeah yeah

1054
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,500
and the movie I really enjoyed it was

1055
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,838
just

1056
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,000
great to hear him speak

1057
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,199
towards the second half they had a lot

1058
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,559
of more of

1059
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,480
um activists and politicians talking

1060
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,838
I don't know I figured maybe it was

1061
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,000
worth two movies yeah yeah

1062
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,519
yeah it's really sad about Frenchie yeah

1063
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,800
really scientific yeah very unexpected

1064
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:55,858
yeah you know he was full of life up

1065
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,079
until his last breath yeah so

1066
00:42:55,858 --> 00:43:02,460
we met for the well we didn't do any

1067
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,940
meat but we were in Goa and then

1068
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,420
late 70s mid 70s late 70s at the New

1069
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:11,700
Year's Eve party at the same one

1070
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,579
but he was like 25 years younger in a

1071
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:18,419
bachelor and I was a mum with four so

1072
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:20,519
and he was a Frenchie I spoke French in

1073
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,800
the French gang and they were very

1074
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,980
separate yeah because nobody else speaks

1075
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,980
French

1076
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:32,220
so we never really met like that but so

1077
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,019
tell us about Goa back back then and by

1078
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:37,559
the time his goal has changed a lot too

1079
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:42,900
yeah and uh so now his magic the first

1080
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:45,838
uh year was there is winter 68 and

1081
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,900
um it was 11 11 Travelers there were 11

1082
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:52,980
people were there wow yeah yeah second

1083
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:55,500
year 200 third year five thousand and

1084
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,858
then just kept growing from there yeah

1085
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,719
and lots of parties yes yes lots of

1086
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:02,818
parties it's a lifestyle too though yeah

1087
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,699
well in the beginning there was no

1088
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:08,279
electricity so only if you had someone

1089
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:10,980
along to play the flute or a guitar or

1090
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,339
some Tablas or something there'd be some

1091
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,019
music and I remember one time we got a

1092
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:18,719
candle from the church I don't know if

1093
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:21,780
we got it or bought it whatever but it

1094
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:24,539
took all night to burn and we sat around

1095
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,819
in a circle all night and I don't think

1096
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:28,019
many speakers people said a word and it

1097
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:31,380
was just

1098
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:33,358
a very strong experience yeah

1099
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,619
so that was what happened in the

1100
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:35,159
beginning

1101
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,039
um

1102
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:40,318
actually when I first arrived there

1103
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:42,719
um you got down there by the Bombay boat

1104
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,940
and you'd land in panjim and cross the

1105
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,519
river in a canoe and then there was

1106
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,818
these copper little buses just big

1107
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:54,119
enough to hold 15 18 people maybe wow

1108
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:58,400
they were driving around at that time

1109
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:01,740
and it was just very magical very uh

1110
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,440
good for acid experiences the green is

1111
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:07,559
already so green this guy's already so

1112
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,500
blue it's already healed yeah the

1113
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:14,099
hibiscus flowers already

1114
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:17,400
with their red colors yeah yeah and the

1115
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:19,800
food there how's the food they yeah they

1116
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,240
uh there's a lot of fish especially in

1117
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,859
the beginning I think now they hardly

1118
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:25,979
get any fish out of the sea anymore

1119
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:27,739
because now they got patrollers now and

1120
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,719
then it was just canoes from the village

1121
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:34,439
and the fisherman and I'd go out at

1122
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,779
night and then get very drunk and Fanny

1123
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,940
and come back in the morning and then

1124
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,000
everybody helps to put in they have a

1125
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,579
big net in like a u-shape and two ends

1126
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,579
You Pull It in so we'd always used to

1127
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,680
help especially the guys and you know

1128
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:52,260
they could take as much fish as you

1129
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,899
wanted if you'd help them put in it wow

1130
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:58,140
yeah it's changed so much over the last

1131
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:00,119
uh 40 years there too yeah yeah it's

1132
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:01,858
become very commercial

1133
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,720
everything yeah it seems like

1134
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:05,699
everything's become commercial I mean I

1135
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,078
remember as a kid being able to drive up

1136
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,460
to Portland Oregon

1137
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,700
from the Bay Area and there would be

1138
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,720
different candy and different sodas

1139
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:15,118
it's not like that anymore different

1140
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,818
stores small business is really most of

1141
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,559
it's gone yeah unfortunately yeah so I

1142
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:21,659
think we gotta treasure the boutique

1143
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,519
companies that we still have and the

1144
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:26,118
people you know even cannabis yeah

1145
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:30,300
cannabis is since it's gone commercial

1146
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:32,400
we've lost some of the Legacy Brands uh

1147
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,380
it's a shame yeah

1148
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,358
so and it's been difficult the Cannabis

1149
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,420
industry is it's not easy like people

1150
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:42,299
would like it to be or think it is

1151
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,519
Lord I remember afterwards actually that

1152
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,619
it quite isolated you from society

1153
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:50,400
because you could never talk

1154
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:52,559
yeah so yeah you only had a certain set

1155
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,760
of friends and that was it yeah but

1156
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,440
you'd have friends doing all because

1157
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,660
people come together from all different

1158
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,400
kind of cultures that smoke pot I feel

1159
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:01,500
like that was the one thing we when I

1160
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,260
was growing there wasn't so much people

1161
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,000
traveling to smoke pot yet oh wow not

1162
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:09,240
that I was aware of I didn't meet them

1163
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,099
yeah yeah I came slowly

1164
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:12,358
yeah now it seems like it's the one

1165
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,920
thing it's kind of like the glue that

1166
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:15,598
holds us all together in some some

1167
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,858
regards over it's fan of this even we

1168
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,140
all go back and we do different things

1169
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:20,699
and we have different Lifestyles yeah we

1170
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:22,618
all get together and we like we like

1171
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:24,000
wait we like smoking pot yeah I think

1172
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:26,880
spinal mist is probably the biggest

1173
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,219
event like that yeah yeah

1174
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,519
yeah but mostly I must say the one in

1175
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:35,759
Chile was also huge I met Harry on there

1176
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:37,759
oh wow yeah nice

1177
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,920
yeah he's in Thailand right now yeah

1178
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,300
living it up yeah so yeah they mixed up

1179
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,579
in Greenhouse in Thailand I think last

1180
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,859
week I think that sounds like a new

1181
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:48,119
Promised Land

1182
00:47:45,858 --> 00:47:49,980
yeah it's interesting because their

1183
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,838
their Market uh

1184
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,699
you know I think for tourism it's great

1185
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,500
because they have so much tourism yeah

1186
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:57,598
and people from Asia will be able to go

1187
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,099
there people from Europe that want to go

1188
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,720
to someplace tropical it's a great place

1189
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:03,180
to go if you like smoking politics

1190
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,459
tourist destination yeah

1191
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:07,879
so yeah I'm excited to go there and I

1192
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,760
was just in uh Tenerife

1193
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:14,039
they have the Champions Cup here

1194
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:18,060
whereas first prize you got a big boxing

1195
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:20,279
belt right and I had to hand out that

1196
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:22,019
and I thought oh because all the guys

1197
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,780
were going like this or the belt before

1198
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:26,338
I could have been getting it so heavy

1199
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,500
yeah

1200
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:32,099
but um

1201
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:34,260
yeah there just have so many coffee

1202
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:37,318
shops there and

1203
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:40,819
or clubs they call them in Spain right

1204
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:44,099
but that's obviously in for the tourists

1205
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:46,500
yeah yeah so I wonder how that goes

1206
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:49,019
anyway yeah we'll see I really like

1207
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,358
Spain in Barcelona especially for the

1208
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:53,639
Social Clubs that they have I look very

1209
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,338
much like the Social Clubs I prefer them

1210
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,019
to coffee shops and to dispensaries yeah

1211
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:00,299
and so far they haven't really thought

1212
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:03,179
of anything else yet no the vibe is all

1213
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,980
chill for the most part and now I like

1214
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:08,578
his friends really

1215
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:11,159
uh agreed to meet up in their Club you

1216
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:14,160
know and then hang out together well I'm

1217
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:16,318
not sure but in dispensaries but in in a

1218
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,420
coffee shop okay maybe you'll have a

1219
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,099
coffee with a friend but it's not like

1220
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,440
in the club you hang out there for a few

1221
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:24,180
hours yeah yeah you can go there talk

1222
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,220
for a few hours and a couple joints yeah

1223
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:28,019
you can drink a beer there yeah they

1224
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:30,239
have alcohol

1225
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:32,338
and because in a social club in that

1226
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,078
setting as far as the government's

1227
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:35,400
concerned it's like it could be a chess

1228
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,220
club it could be anything it's not even

1229
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,280
considered Spain it's its own private

1230
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:44,879
thing yeah and uh yeah totally different

1231
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,339
business model yeah no I like uh clubs

1232
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,920
yeah and the Cannabis has gotten a lot

1233
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:50,639
better the hash has gotten better

1234
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,680
um

1235
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,259
you know I think the varieties and the

1236
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,879
accessibility to stuff and and growing

1237
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,940
equipment and nutrients and all these

1238
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,619
things yeah and the the market has

1239
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,700
matured over there quite a bit and I was

1240
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:06,900
really impressed with the stuff that's

1241
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:09,480
in the shops uh I know if uh if I'm here

1242
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,280
in the states and people I tell them you

1243
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,099
know from Amsterdam oh I'm gonna come

1244
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,780
there are you lucky girl yeah and tell

1245
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:18,240
them if I was you I'd go to Barcelona

1246
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,480
now yeah there's more variety better

1247
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,479
weather

1248
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:25,500
more variety better weather yeah it just

1249
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,639
and the people are great not that the

1250
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,739
people aren't great in Amsterdam because

1251
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,559
I really like the people

1252
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:34,618
but in Amsterdam it's also forbidden to

1253
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,679
sell extracts or and they're all

1254
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:39,780
paranoid to sell Rising even even though

1255
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:42,000
technically what I understand at all

1256
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,599
that should be legal because it has only

1257
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,760
been squashed right you know I'm saying

1258
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,220
as my hash things you know you haven't

1259
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,559
involved a cooking process or anything

1260
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:55,199
it shouldn't be any yeah manipulation

1261
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,480
yeah but even Edibles you have to have

1262
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,919
ugly looking cake it can't be marketed

1263
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,500
like it can't be marketed towards kids

1264
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,619
obviously but it can't be none of it

1265
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:07,500
looks good it's ugly cake and because I

1266
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:09,838
think technically by law it's also not

1267
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,539
really allowed right yeah you know some

1268
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:15,358
coffee shops have uh bubble hash and

1269
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:17,460
they do have rosin they don't call it

1270
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:20,098
that right yeah they just call isolator

1271
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,400
yeah yeah

1272
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:25,019
yeah I like well and Amsterdam has a

1273
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,680
good variety of stuff so if you know

1274
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:33,179
where to go you can get us it does but

1275
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:35,338
now uh this American yeah yeah but yeah

1276
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:37,199
climb four stairs to get there right you

1277
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:39,659
gotta clean yeah seriously it's a

1278
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,699
workout though

1279
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:45,058
but uh

1280
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:47,000
I think before yes definitely

1281
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:52,339
Now American

1282
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,338
genetics are so popular there yeah and

1283
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:58,318
I think people consider those great ones

1284
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:01,199
that were touched before I could be like

1285
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,818
okay well we know those and well I think

1286
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,439
a lot of the Dutch genetics came

1287
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:06,719
originally from California too in

1288
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,460
California and South America and you

1289
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,399
know we had some interesting breeding

1290
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:14,220
going on in the 80s and 90s in Amsterdam

1291
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,380
and in the Netherlands okay so yes but

1292
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:18,058
some really good stuff okay so and now

1293
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:21,420
it's coming back in the States these

1294
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:24,119
hazes are coming back I never I never

1295
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,159
found any weed in the 80s did I no not

1296
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,079
an idiot but you weren't looking for it

1297
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,000
oh it was of course it was yeah so when

1298
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,339
the city was full of it yeah yeah yeah

1299
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,920
yeah yeah yeah yeah that was before my

1300
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:36,358
time and answered it but uh yeah really

1301
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,818
really interesting in the breeding

1302
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:41,219
projects that went on you know it's like

1303
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:43,619
Super Lemon Haze and Amnesia and Liberty

00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,000
popular there extremely popular good

1307
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,460
hash strain and you know and there are

1308
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,079
so many seed companies yeah suddenly

1309
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,059
since he went big they did a lot of

1310
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:00,000
stuff they'd you know

1311
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:02,280
a lot of seed companies so many not so

1312
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,579
many new ones no you know in the last 10

1313
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,800
years maybe just a few while in Spain I

1314
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,480
remember from one year to the next

1315
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,000
um you know you kind of keep track of

1316
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,219
what's going on they were like 70 46

1317
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,900
Spanish seed companies oh yeah yeah but

1318
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:17,338
only only 10 of them actually probably

1319
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,900
made seeds the rest were just buying

1320
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:21,599
seeds from somebody else to resell too

1321
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:24,240
soon yeah yeah totally but you know it's

1322
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:27,420
it wasn't my business right it's an

1323
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,739
interesting interesting Market uh but

1324
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,059
yeah and like each one of the seed

1325
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,699
companies in Amsterdam they all had

1326
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:34,920
their their classic signature genetics

1327
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:36,598
yeah you know Luke from Paradise he had

1328
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,220
his Scentsy star like that that's his

1329
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:39,780
claim to fame and yeah you know

1330
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:41,039
Greenhouse they had several over the

1331
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,900
years and

1332
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,058
so it's interesting but all the all the

1333
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,460
older companies they really had that one

1334
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:49,920
claim to fame generic their Flagship and

1335
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:52,920
I think the first one was uh when I

1336
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,539
tweet down boy Widow yeah yeah that was

1337
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,680
it's funny because I just I I don't know

1338
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:57,058
if you saw the White Widow that I had

1339
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,338
last week I had some White Widow flower

1340
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:00,960
but it's the first time I've seen it

1341
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:03,119
since the 90s we had this stuff called

1342
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,760
the sweat it was a phenotype of the wet

1343
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,220
with the white widow and it was super

1344
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,440
super strong and these guys in Richmond

1345
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:12,419
would grow it and it was this crew of

1346
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,639
guys and this stuff was super expensive

1347
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,318
but it would make you sweat had nothing

1348
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,000
to do with the genetic sweating or

1349
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,039
anything yeah it would make you sweat

1350
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,300
like literally you know you would be

1351
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,460
dripping sweat after you smoked it

1352
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,079
because it was so strong and that was

1353
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,940
really good White Widow and most of the

1354
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:28,680
European stuff is very kind of a vanilla

1355
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,260
White Widow we don't see the really

1356
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:33,739
strong pungent smelling White Widow wow

1357
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,740
yeah yeah

1358
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,880
origin I think developed that but then

1359
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:41,039
he made other ones also yeah that was

1360
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,059
pre-green house I believe

1361
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:48,480
yeah the stories there maybe yeah the

1362
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:50,339
story yes who knows yeah we hear all

1363
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,318
kinds of different stories for for the

1364
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:53,880
origins and you know as we smoke a lot

1365
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:56,039
of weed and get older as things change

1366
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,440
it seems like but yeah there were so

1367
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:01,500
many seed companies back in the 90s

1368
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,659
in Amsterdam okay in High Times magazine

1369
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,940
we got we read about like I as a kid so

1370
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:08,039
in the 90s I was a kid

1371
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,780
I first started smoking in 91 but High

1372
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,699
Times magazine was a big deal and you go

1373
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,720
in there for all the Cannabis

1374
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:15,480
information you couldn't go to the

1375
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:17,519
bookstore and buy it we went to uh tell

1376
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,480
it I'd get it on Telegraph Avenue in

1377
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,818
Berkeley

1378
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,858
so we had these seashell pipes

1379
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,300
and this guy would uh you know make

1380
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:26,338
these seashell pipes and they were like

1381
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,200
10 or 15 which was a lot of money at

1382
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:30,358
that time compared to like now

1383
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,159
but yeah good times and it was but it

1384
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:33,960
was like still you didn't and you had

1385
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,358
the High Times oh yeah and they had high

1386
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,960
times at Ed Rosenthal books uh Jorge

1387
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:42,358
Cervantes books you know uh uh Mel Frank

1388
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,440
they had those three staples and if

1389
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:45,539
you're one of the books you'd get them

1390
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,220
on the street in telegram or on

1391
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:49,199
Telegraph

1392
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,719
so go get some lunch skateboard around

1393
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:54,659
the city I think at that time

1394
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:57,480
yeah maybe some books would be starting

1395
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:59,399
because once I started my shop we were

1396
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,318
started selling books and in the end we

1397
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,920
had like

1398
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:06,900
150 titles half of them about cannabis

1399
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,079
and half of the bound about psychedelics

1400
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,519
and mushrooms and everything yeah yeah

1401
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,599
there's a lot of good books out there

1402
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,920
there's a lot of good books that you

1403
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:17,220
can't find here in the states that are

1404
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,300
only in Europe maybe maybe that I've you

1405
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:20,039
know I haven't seen them in the States

1406
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,300
you guys have a lot more books it seems

1407
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:24,058
like on the subject

1408
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,740
yeah but nobody buys books not because

1409
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:29,040
they're all get their info from Google

1410
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:30,959
or whatever well next is chat GP you're

1411
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,259
just talking to you ask the app what you

1412
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,159
want to know and oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

1413
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,400
you can actually train it to do

1414
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,838
different things but yeah I mean

1415
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,300
get it to write your essays and book

1416
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,699
reports you can but they're yeah it's

1417
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,960
very soon if you do they'll be able the

1418
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:48,058
teachers are gonna have the way where

1419
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,858
they can find out yeah at the moment

1420
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:52,260
there's a big to-do about it because

1421
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:54,719
smart kids are using it and the teachers

1422
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,520
aren't aware of it yeah and just finding

1423
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:59,899
out about it so now they're doubtful of

1424
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:59,900
every anybody's writing

1425
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,559
yeah it's it's really interesting what

1426
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,780
do you think about all this technology

1427
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,480
you think it's good I know when we were

1428
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:12,119
talking earlier about a nuclear you were

1429
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,740
very against nuclear well like I said

1430
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,660
mainly because they haven't figured out

1431
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:18,899
what to do with the waste material right

1432
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:20,699
I think once they get that solved I do

1433
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,680
believe what I

1434
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:24,598
or he didn't know about it that it's

1435
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,818
good but then you also have these

1436
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,740
terrible accidents like oh yeah like

1437
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:31,139
Fukushima yeah

1438
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:33,979
anywhere else in that time and yeah yeah

1439
00:57:31,139 --> 00:57:33,980
Chernobyl

1440
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,640
yeah and it is clean energy I mean I

1441
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,318
think it is clean yeah I mean yeah

1442
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,659
it's it's an interesting conversation

1443
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,539
for sure but then as far as technology

1444
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:48,058
now I think oh yeah it goes totally

1445
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:49,920
Beyond me because even my phone I don't

1446
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:52,800
know how to deal with it you know that

1447
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,139
my phone give up phoning a couple days

1448
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,240
ago yeah you took a little break for a

1449
00:57:55,139 --> 00:58:00,960
couple days from from uh your cell phone

1450
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:03,058
no no I can't get it to work as a phone

1451
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,220
anymore oh right now I can only do a

1452
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:07,220
Gmail and what's up and whatnot

1453
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,420
now uh and I dread the day that they

1454
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,760
really have to get any hearing aid

1455
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,900
because I hear hear that goes on an app

1456
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,900
on Bluetooth also

1457
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:24,420
yeah everything has an app yeah yeah

1458
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:26,460
Bluetooth capable now you know we're

1459
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,559
talking about dab rigs lighters all this

1460
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,358
stuff yeah you know it's all we rely on

1461
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,440
technology yeah maybe a little more than

1462
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:33,779
we should

1463
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,440
maybe who knows but it's obviously the

1464
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:40,140
direction is going and um

1465
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,019
I won't have to keep up for too many

1466
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:45,719
more years

1467
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:47,880
you never know you never know

1468
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:50,818
but I'm my daughter there she helps me

1469
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,318
so much yeah yeah when you look back at

1470
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:54,900
the industry and all the stuff you've

1471
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:57,000
done what do you feel

1472
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:00,240
was your your biggest contribution to

1473
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,239
the industry I think the pollinating

1474
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:06,479
I kind of got things moving because that

1475
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:09,058
I think the first time that even had the

1476
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,519
thought I can make my own house yeah you

1477
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:13,319
know before that it never occurred I

1478
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,059
remember the first time I showed them at

1479
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:17,159
one of the High Times cops I had several

1480
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:19,019
ladies coming over and they'd always

1481
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:20,940
thought that hash came from like a

1482
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:23,280
chocolate factory right I didn't even

1483
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:26,460
realize that it came from the cannabis

1484
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,740
plant yeah so there was a lot of

1485
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:31,199
not going around

1486
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:33,118
I think and not just because of it but

1487
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,639
yeah just because it started things

1488
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,780
rolling and moving in the end yeah I

1489
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,759
mean you're the beginning of all this

1490
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,380
technology

1491
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,619
and I can't use it and I don't

1492
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:47,519
understand it yeah

1493
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:49,920
yeah it's it's pretty wild yes it took a

1494
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:53,039
life of its own yeah yeah really yeah

1495
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,740
but I can see everybody's happiness yes

1496
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:58,440
enthusiastic and yeah with what they're

1497
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:02,459
doing and everything so

1498
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:04,619
and this house so I fully bless what's

1499
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:06,119
going on I think it's a great thing yeah

1500
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:08,818
it makes the world a better place in my

1501
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,559
opinion yeah yeah definitely I just want

1502
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:14,699
to tell a little story one of the

1503
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:16,740
craziest uh occurrences on my trips

1504
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:18,899
um well actually there's a couple but

1505
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:20,779
this is a nice little one we arrived in

1506
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,880
Pakistan from

1507
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,740
Afghanistan and there was a Sunday or

1508
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,960
whatever there was no banks open so we

1509
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:28,798
had no money so we're kind of wandering

1510
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,720
around

1511
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,679
and then there was these two little

1512
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:37,259
bicycle rickshaws they were quite small

1513
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:39,838
but beautifully decorated with colors

1514
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,220
and blinkers and everything so I've been

1515
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:43,679
messing with nothing else to do we

1516
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:44,759
followed them and we ended up at this

1517
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,519
circus

1518
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,319
and not only the owner but everybody in

1519
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,420
it was

1520
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:54,000
a little person and what you call that

1521
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:56,460
correctly a Lily Potter you know nobody

1522
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,338
was bigger than up to my waist nobody

1523
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:01,318
and even the owner and he had his own

1524
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:04,759
tent and he was made of silk and

1525
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:08,219
applique and he sat inside like some

1526
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:10,980
Middle Eastern ratio these poofs there

1527
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:13,399
and his hookah in front of him and with

1528
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:16,500
his enormous turbo and beard everything

1529
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:18,780
even at dancing girls although what they

1530
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,519
were wearing was quite hilarious they

1531
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,859
must have heard about browse from the

1532
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:25,679
west

1533
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:27,779
and bikinis and stuff or something but

1534
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:31,699
what that turned out is something I'm

1535
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:31,700
sure Madonna got her they're from them

1536
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:39,059
yeah the cone broth and we stayed there

1537
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:40,078
for three days and we performed in the

1538
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:42,480
circus

1539
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,420
and my daughter was three then would

1540
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,219
sing baba black sheep and everybody crew

1541
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,940
and was wonderful

1542
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:53,159
and the guys were done dress up as bears

1543
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:55,200
in the fights and they thought that was

1544
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:57,118
great I don't know what the otherwise

1545
01:01:55,199 --> 01:02:00,539
the hand in that circus

1546
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,539
and uh we had to dance rock and roll

1547
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:05,159
with the some of the guys and but even

1548
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:07,500
the whole Orchestra were these small

1549
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:10,318
people so they played them they standing

1550
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,900
on a stool yeah yeah it was a crazy

1551
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:15,900
situation

1552
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:19,980
very nice he looked after us very well

1553
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:22,200
yeah really cool but to get there was

1554
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,480
actually the first time that I really

1555
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:26,159
smuggled some hash from Afghanistan into

1556
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,460
Pakistan

1557
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:32,578
and we landed up traveling through

1558
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,920
Afghanistan finally to the Khyber Pass

1559
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:37,619
and that's apparently where trucks came

1560
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,740
from India to stock up on hash as far as

1561
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:43,559
I heard or experience but you could get

1562
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:46,379
it there twenty dollars a kilo

1563
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:49,559
so with my last money more or less I got

1564
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:52,619
two kilo but I was traveling with six uh

1565
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:55,200
guys Western guys at that time and

1566
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:58,680
everybody got some then we got closer to

1567
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:00,779
the border so in the end I had to call

1568
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:03,838
the house and put it in a big bag with

1569
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,798
some towels and kid stuff on top sat in

1570
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,798
front

1571
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:10,739
seat with my daughter

1572
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:13,380
and the driver was very concerned if I

1573
01:03:10,739 --> 01:03:15,618
was enjoying it and was I okay and

1574
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:19,079
everything and then we got to the barter

1575
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:21,720
and one of the Border guys comes over

1576
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:25,798
because malus and me my daughter we got

1577
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:27,779
invited to eat we have tea with officer

1578
01:03:25,798 --> 01:03:30,539
officer had never seen a little girl

1579
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,220
with blue curls and blue eyes and blonde

1580
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,759
curls and blue eyes

1581
01:03:32,219 --> 01:03:37,199
and we are tea and edible cookies and in

1582
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,380
the meantime the whole bus was getting

1583
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:41,639
searched and also very much the locals I

1584
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,519
don't know what they were supposed to be

1585
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:47,039
bringing from Afghanistan to Pakistan I

1586
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:49,858
think stuff like rice or some vegetable

1587
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:52,019
I don't think cash was involved

1588
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:54,480
anyway finally everybody piled back in

1589
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:57,420
the bus and the officer himself carried

1590
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,838
my bag back and put it back in the box

1591
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:01,858
and continued that's great yeah yeah so

1592
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,960
tell us some more stories about

1593
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:06,119
smuggling I know you got some good ones

1594
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,980
not just because I got we got talking

1595
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:09,960
about Afghanistan when I arrived there

1596
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,920
that was also something we arrived on

1597
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,019
the bus

1598
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,818
but the bus didn't really want to ride

1599
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:17,219
all the way to the Border because he had

1600
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:19,259
a whole next lot of customers waiting

1601
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:21,959
like six hours earlier

1602
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:24,299
so he dropped us about a half a

1603
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,920
kilometer away from the border pointed

1604
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:28,199
up the hill

1605
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,420
he said that support her but it was in

1606
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:34,379
the middle of the night it was all dark

1607
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:36,659
so we got our luggage I mean you didn't

1608
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:38,640
carry more than or have more with you

1609
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:41,759
than you could carry in those days that

1610
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:44,578
would have been stupid so took our

1611
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,319
luggage and walked up there and they're

1612
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:48,240
both kind of shapes in the dark either

1613
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:51,539
they were walking your way or the

1614
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:54,539
opposite way or just standing still

1615
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:58,139
we got up there and uh there was some

1616
01:04:54,539 --> 01:05:00,119
tie shops and they all had these um kind

1617
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:03,058
of beds around where people sit on and

1618
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:07,019
eat and drink their food and it was

1619
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:10,079
great some tea suddenly the Border

1620
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:11,880
Police or control come over and they're

1621
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,640
carrying something with them and it's

1622
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,880
their hookah pipe okay they put their

1623
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:20,578
hookah pipe and fill it and everything

1624
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,740
and they show us how to smoke me

1625
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:25,980
especially and then they just said

1626
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:28,078
welcome to Afghanistan I was just as

1627
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,940
such a Magic Moment couldn't believe it

1628
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,760
wow

1629
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:34,679
yeah no I really like the people there

1630
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,319
they were very uh

1631
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:40,858
welcoming and we ate everyone lots of

1632
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:43,739
houses and met it was really a nice

1633
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:46,019
country upstairs I always felt it was

1634
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:48,719
because we were all of the hookah pipe

1635
01:05:46,019 --> 01:05:51,119
yeah yeah when they grow in some really

1636
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:54,058
harsh climates there oh really harsh

1637
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:58,079
climates yeah yeah so Mila tell me your

1638
01:05:54,059 --> 01:06:00,599
story about uh the American book of law

1639
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:03,180
the only time I ever had the American

1640
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:04,980
book of law in my hands was when I

1641
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:05,940
bought it second hand on the market in

1642
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,699
Delhi

1643
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:11,400
and that was a time when I used to send

1644
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:14,098
back books sometimes with some ash in it

1645
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:18,480
and this book of law I don't know it's

1646
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:19,318
huge and it was like a treasure

1647
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,639
um

1648
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:26,099
and he made it I used to uh well I sent

1649
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:28,558
it to Holland and it made it that was

1650
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:31,260
very nice but the feeling of having this

1651
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:34,019
book of law for this very purpose of

1652
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:36,299
cutting it open and putting Ash into it

1653
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:40,500
and shipping it out was something

1654
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:42,900
special extreme yeah well and I think

1655
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:45,119
you know even on a higher level like

1656
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:47,099
without doing things like that and

1657
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,318
breaking the law and pushing the limits

1658
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:51,539
cannabis wouldn't be legal today yeah

1659
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:52,739
probably that's another one of your

1660
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:55,680
Legacies

1661
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:58,679
for sure I think uh not even probably

1662
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,598
it's 100 if people didn't do the illegal

1663
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:03,298
stuff and break the law yeah it would

1664
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,338
not be legal today so I don't know why

1665
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:08,219
it was legal in the first place that's a

1666
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:09,900
whole nother whole different story as to

1667
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:10,739
the thing that started here in the

1668
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,440
states

1669
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:15,959
yeah I I believe you're right

1670
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,720
and so yeah unfortunately yeah you know

1671
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,460
but I'm glad we're out you know I saw

1672
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:22,259
when when I saw medical for the first

1673
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,599
time in 96

1674
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:26,819
uh I knew someday it would be legal in

1675
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,318
my lifetime okay I didn't know how soon

1676
01:07:26,818 --> 01:07:30,358
I didn't realize that it would happen

1677
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:32,460
like it happened but I knew that it was

1678
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:34,739
going to happen and I was excited for it

1679
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:36,900
you know I think I don't know by that

1680
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:39,838
time I'd been smoking so long and never

1681
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:42,059
really considered to be a medical so I

1682
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:45,119
thought it was more like a roost to get

1683
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:47,220
in through the back door yeah but

1684
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,740
um since then I've also changed my

1685
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:51,779
opinion by myself and realized I've been

1686
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:54,358
smoking the medical all those years yeah

1687
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:56,220
and that's why I never get touchwood got

1688
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:58,019
very sick very much

1689
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:59,459
I believe it was Dennis perone that said

1690
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:01,259
it's medical whether you believe it is

1691
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,760
or not yeah yeah something like that

1692
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,280
yeah and I think there's definitely a

1693
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,839
lot of Truth yeah yeah well so what

1694
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,240
other events are you doing this year do

1695
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:11,338
you plan on doing uh more dabadus this

1696
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:13,500
year or are you going to any other day

1697
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:16,818
this year maybe I'm hoping to do some

1698
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:19,920
damage to do here's right in the U.S

1699
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:22,798
and before that I'll be

1700
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,100
in Berlin for the

1701
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:28,920
full moon sesh and I'm very interested

1702
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,679
because online we got connection with an

1703
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,060
Afghani person and we've even bought

1704
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,460
seeds from him

1705
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:38,520
and

1706
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:42,539
the last month or so he got Refugee

1707
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:44,520
status in Germany wow so they gave him a

1708
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:48,119
house and a job and a bank account as

1709
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:51,199
far as I know and he's there now so when

1710
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:54,238
this full moon sesh came on

1711
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:56,759
my daughter got it together and asked

1712
01:08:54,238 --> 01:09:00,358
him and yes he would love to judge so

1713
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:03,298
actually we're both judging triceift so

1714
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:07,140
I'm very curious about his opinion of

1715
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:09,420
what we think is worth entering as

1716
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:11,219
tricep for a competition

1717
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:15,239
the first time I was growing in

1718
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:18,239
Amsterdam an old Afghan friend came by

1719
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:20,698
one time and I showed him the garden and

1720
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:22,798
he was hugely impressed by the size of

1721
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,298
the buds because there of course they've

1722
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:28,979
never ever had nutrients or anything

1723
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:31,920
hardly rain yeah and uh and then I said

1724
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:36,539
yeah I'm harvesting tomorrow and he's

1725
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:39,420
like why what I said well about 10 of

1726
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:41,819
the crystals is changing color and

1727
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:44,159
people smoke weed think that's the right

1728
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:45,239
time to harvest and get it ready for

1729
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:47,880
smoking

1730
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:50,278
and then I asked him and I'm very glad I

1731
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:53,100
did and yeah I asked him I said but you

1732
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:56,940
guys only make hash so when would you

1733
01:09:53,100 --> 01:10:00,360
harvest and he said in about two weeks

1734
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:01,859
wow and alas because we did all our

1735
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:03,779
growing indoor

1736
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:05,819
I could never find anyone who was

1737
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:07,500
prepared to buy pay the electricity bill

1738
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:10,738
to have the

1739
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,719
grow go on for an extra two weeks and

1740
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:14,819
not being certain that that would be

1741
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,698
financially worth it right what are you

1742
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:19,319
going to end up with is that so I don't

1743
01:10:17,698 --> 01:10:22,198
know one day I'm gonna be able to hope

1744
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:24,179
to try it and see what the different

1745
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:25,738
effect is then it definitely has a

1746
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:28,319
different effect though because I would

1747
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:30,299
imagine also it has maybe more CBD in it

1748
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:33,599
than those kind of different kind of you

1749
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:35,340
know it's cultivar dependent okay uh

1750
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,640
yeah and the flavors change completely

1751
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:40,619
from you know on a 63 what what I think

1752
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,659
most people harvested 63 days some of

1753
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:44,039
them should probably be harvested 56 and

1754
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:46,799
some should be harvested a little later

1755
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:49,500
so it's really cultivar dependent in my

1756
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:52,260
opinion eight weeks

1757
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:54,479
eight weeks is 56 days okay that's a

1758
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:56,340
good one yeah yeah that's where we had I

1759
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,979
could fill it in on the map yeah ahead

1760
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:01,380
of time 56 days for a lot of stuff is

1761
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:03,479
great yeah but then Sour Diesel for

1762
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:05,880
instance that in my opinion needs to go

1763
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:07,619
a minimum of 70 days something like that

1764
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,600
some of these OG varieties that we used

1765
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:11,279
to grow 70 days yeah okay they could

1766
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,900
even go 77.

1767
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:17,639
so we just had one variety yeah and came

1768
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:19,619
in from California and a bunch of

1769
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,380
flowers as a clone

1770
01:11:19,619 --> 01:11:24,719
it was called orange but orange Bud well

1771
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,000
we had Calio that was 16 weeks

1772
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:30,119
so I I never grew one of my friends grew

1773
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,819
up today but 16 weeks is that Nakamura

1774
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:35,939
sativa yeah it's very very

1775
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:37,559
equatorial sativa

1776
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:40,319
but really orange it was like the

1777
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:43,080
pre-tangy butt that had that tangerine

1778
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:45,000
orange flavor a little rind in there and

1779
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:47,158
really you know the effect was good

1780
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,800
though really nice

1781
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:51,179
so yeah so thank you so much for coming

1782
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,520
out on the show I really appreciate it

1783
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:55,500

1784
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,900
