doing thank you very much James for

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,359
having me on here I'm great so you're a

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,518
terrorist I I am a little terrorist you

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,759
know we are here moving a lot of

10
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,799
products and helping out this industry

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,480
and trying to bring a community back to

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,718
where it needs to be glad to have you on

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,919
the show we've been talking about this

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,920
for a little while uh we met not so long

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,239
ago but I knew about your product for

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,600
the last year and a half good flour that

17
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,759
I've seen coming from uh your nutrient

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,198
line yeah I thought you were running it

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,679
about for two years now I was just under

20
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:55,280
the impression I was like oh man so just

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,519
the last six weeks it's the SF well been

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,679
running it I've known about it for a

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,399
long time uh SF Cana my my buddies over

24
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,879
there they've been running it yes and

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,159
crushing with it so yeah I was I was

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,960
excited to uh test it out and see how it

27
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,600
does and so thank you very much we're

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,478
we're running it right now for in our

29
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:15,359
veg no thank you it people like you in

30
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,840
this industry is what we need James you

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,400
know research development and get better

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
yeah you know this whole industry that's

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,680
what we have to do is get better as the

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,759
industry yeah I think a lot of research

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,520
and development goes goes on here and I

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,118
think a lot of people really need to do

37
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,959
side-by-side testing I think that's so

38
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,159
huge to determine what's good and what's

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,478
not good and there's a lot of stuff that

40
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,000
maybe uh works for a certain person and

41
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,840
another individual something else works

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,879
for them and so you know even cloning

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,680
techniques stuff like that

44
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:48,519
and because it's a plant and it's so

45
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:52,118
Dynamic not every recipe works for every

46
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:54,039
situation uh Light Recipes you know you

47
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:56,000
know you name it there's so many

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,520
variables involved and that that's what

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,118
I love is being on the cusp of trying

50
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,599
new things and cutting Edge uh nutrients

51
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,599
Cutting Edge

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,439
techniques um Cutting Edge ideas I I

53
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,479
love that stuff being on the on the on

54
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,280
the edge of what's new and what's

55
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,878
upcoming and some of it's amazing some

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,800
of it's terrible some of it's everything

57
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,479
in between you know it's it's an

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,280
interesting time to be alive but you

59
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,518
learn something through all of it that's

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,400
all that matters you know like great

61
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,239
thing that you brought that up I'm

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,400
actually joining a group of about five

63
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,800
or six guys that are coming together

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
which all different walks of life but in

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,560
this industry um we have a grow two

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Growers involved in it a genetics guy

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,920
involved in it a hydro store involved in

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,080
it myself um and we're just trying to

69
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,878
come together as a unit and build a

70
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,440
research and development facility yeah

71
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,000
exactly kind of like what you're saying

72
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,479
we're going to have some that are double

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,878
Stacks we're going to have some that are

74
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,679
single Stacks we're going to have double

75
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,719
stack mother room double stack baby room

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
just to see all the different angles of

77
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:04,280
the this industry and how far we can

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,319
actually push this envelope because

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,280
realistically we've only been pushing

80
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,878
the envelope about 5 six years you know

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,280
where we can actually come out of the

82
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,199
shadows and show our talents you know so

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,680
I look at this industry we're only five

84
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,959
six years old so our goal is to hit 10

85
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,879
pounds in a couple years per light 10

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,000
pounds per 4x4 you heard it here first

87
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,079
hey we have to do it you know because

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,799
cost per pound once corporate comes into

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
this industry full-fledged in

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,280
our Sops need to be about $200 a pound

91
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,359
per 4x4 vertically you can get that

92
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,878
that's realistic I guess or per 4x4

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,760
stack three high no talking about

94
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,120
single what's your thought on uh the

95
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,519
Double the two-tier the double

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,400
stack uh what's what's your opinion on

97
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,280
that because me personally I think some

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,039
of my friends do really well with it I

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,239
prefer uh High ceilings with tall plants

100
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,199
it all dep depends on your building yeah

101
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,759
you know environment is the most crucial

102
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,000
thing for your garden you know there's

103
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:13,280
some places where it allows a double

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,840
stack um we're actually in talks with

105
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,798
another building on top of what we're

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,280
already planning on moving into in the

107
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:25,679
near future is a triple stack yeah and

108
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:28,478
that one has 210 lights per room there's

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,439
a there's a 12 rooms in this facility as

110
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,240
well so those are the things that we're

111
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:36,519
looking forward to is to continue to

112
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,759
evolve and continue to get better you

113
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:42,079
know that's honestly what the group The

114
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,840
connected guys and grow world and that

115
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,399
whole little group I love that group I I

116
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,239
went there like a year and a half ago to

117
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,000
the connect event and I just seen all

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,680
they're doing is pushing education into

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
this industry you know girl world a is

120
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,199
great I mean it's I'm glad to be a part

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,880
of it I think they're really great

122
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,919
people we're working they've connected

123
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,519
with really great people yes uh yeah and

124
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,478
it's just it's a nice Community same

125
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,758
thing with Sergio what he's done with

126
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,560
the connect events yes I mean that's

127
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,520
just it was his calling and he's really

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,038
owned it and taken it on and now he's

129
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,359
doing them all over the world that

130
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,560
events and I just I love seeing my

131
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,800
friends win and it's great we've had him

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,280
on the show and him and I have became

133
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,038
friends over the last year and he's just

134
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,879
a great guy and you know it's like he's

135
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:34,318
on this upward trajectory and love it is

136
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,360
good people want to surround themselves

137
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,280
and good things actually come out of it

138
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,680
when that happens you know and first

139
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,758
thing for me as well I seen Sergio and I

140
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,840
was like oh my goodness who is this guy

141
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,319
you know and just continuing to listen

142
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,918
to what he's doing and I just told him

143
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,160
hey how can I help you you know I see

144
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,959
your business I see your philosophy but

145
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,080
there's other angles that might be able

146
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,478
to come in and help and turn on a couple

147
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:04,279
light switches for him you know and he's

148
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:07,800
going to be probably a part of the whole

149
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,758
R&amp;D facility you know because he brought

150
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,879
this up and he said hey are you guys

151
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,280
interested you know and I had talked to

152
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,319
one of the Growers that's going to be a

153
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,359
part of it two years ago I said listen I

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,439
need a R&amp;D facility because I'm coming

155
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,759
out with our nutrient line and I want to

156
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,279
know everything about it you know like

157
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,520
we're still two years R&amp;D our nutrient

158
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:33,439
line because nothing's to be set in

159
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,560
stone until the Growers say that's what

160
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,719
we need you know and we'll still

161
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,399
continue to make lines you know we're

162
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,560
going to have a line that we have that

163
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,198
comes out which is a standard line but

164
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,959
our expert line we're going to continue

165
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,879
to evolve and innovate with the Growers

166
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,439
right I'm not a grower anymore I had to

167
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,360
let those days go you know but for me

168
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,598
I'm about sourcing the right people the

169
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,280
right products and putting it together

170
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,399
as a unit you know custom mag

171
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,758
formulators in Fresno that's who Blends

172
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,878
it for us and I have zero problem

173
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,879
letting everybody know that because you

174
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,919
build a relationship with people and if

175
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,879
you have a relationship with people they

176
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,639
don't want to burn you you know and

177
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,199
that's kind of in dealing with the good

178
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,800
ones don't at least hey the good ones

179
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,079
don't but guess what yeah you learn

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,439
something even if someone does burn you

181
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,560
as long as it doesn't take everything

182
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,879
from you you know and so that's kind of

183
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,399
the philosophy that's what I learned

184
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,960
from Sergio is trust people you know I

185
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,439
don't like to trust people especially in

186
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,758
this industry most people don't pay

187
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,759
their bills it's difficult at this time

188
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,360
it's tough dude it's trusty I mean the I

189
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,439
have trust issues with this industry as

190
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,919
well especially with genetics and seeds

191
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,240
and and you know it's like uh giving

192
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,918
people terms on stuff that that gets me

193
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,158
very nervous and I I've done it with

194
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,519
some people and gotten completely

195
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:51,240
screwed there's people out there that

196
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,079
have screwed me yeah and but but you do

197
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,598
have I mean there is a certain level of

198
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,519
trust with certain people where you know

199
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,319
especially after repeated business we

200
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:04,359
are in an interesting industry

201
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,680
and it's everchanging it's very volatile

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,479
um there's not a lot of stability so I

203
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,079
still have trust issues it is and

204
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,199
everyone's getting divided right now

205
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:15,560
yeah that's what's going on so some of

206
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,400
us are getting divided and some of us

207
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,720
are getting together and I feel like

208
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,560
I've been in this industry a long time

209
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,879
and I'm always one to want to join

210
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,000
forces with other people and try to do

211
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,879
it bigger and better and you know and

212
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,079
there's a lot of talent left still

213
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
there's a lot Talent gone uh the

214
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,158
industry has changed but there is a lot

215
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,799
of talent out there there is and so I

216
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,200
mean with within our circles and I know

217
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,278
some of the people in your circles and

218
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,839
some of the people in my circle we have

219
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:47,679
a lot of talent um is and it's not just

220
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,519
genetics or not just cultivation it's

221
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,639
everything correct and how big can you

222
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,440
be by yourself right and so that's what

223
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm preaching now it's I'm deal I only

224
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,880
sell to hydroponic stores right I have

225
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,720
the ability I have everyone's addresses

226
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,759
to sell direct but I believe in people

227
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,600
that have helped me get to where I am

228
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,679
you know so why am I going to go and go

229
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,560
around their backs you know like back in

230
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,359
the day hey if we used to go to your

231
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,278
Hook guy guess what happens you don't

232
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,519
get those phone calls anymore you know

233
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:21,360
and so as Growers believe that they're

234
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,399
selling more than the hydroponic stores

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,200
or they buy more than a hydroponic store

236
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,639
does yeah that's correct in some cases

237
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,560
but now if you bring a group of a couple

238
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,799
hundred hydro stores together you bring

239
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,278
a group of a couple hundred Growers

240
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:40,719
together now you actually have leverage

241
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:42,039
and that's numbers is power you know and

242
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,440
that's where you'll end up being able to

243
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,759
leverage things so a lot of Growers are

244
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,519
out there and they don't buy at hydro

245
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:51,000
stores anymore we understand that and

246
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
the education at the hydro store needs

247
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,399
to get better you know and that's going

248
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,719
to be it needs to get better the

249
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,879
dispensary too it does and but but these

250
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,560
things they can be improved they can be

251
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,078
you know you know and so that was one of

252
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,000
my things that I was speaking with a

253
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,039
couple guys in the group is hey when we

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,720
go into the hydro stores let's make

255
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,799
reals let's make every product that

256
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,399
we're displaying a reel a two-minute

257
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,359
reel and let the

258
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,958
manufacturers express what they want to

259
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,720
express about their product to get it

260
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,759
into the store you know to where you

261
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,240
don't have to rely on the store but you

262
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,559
know like I'm going to end up building a

263
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,480
group of stores together and bring them

264
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,518
as a unit and say hey log in to the

265
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,000
connect events listen educate yourself

266
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,879
get better you know because that's where

267
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,360
we got to go toost a connect event at

268
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,799
your location you know I feel like the

269
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,000
Sergio is going all over with connect

270
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,759
events too I do love the sack location

271
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,919
though those are great I love sack and

272
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,600
i' except the traffic except for the

273
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,879
traffic that's horrible man yeah there's

274
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,959
there's some good food out in sack too

275
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,799
surprisingly you it but yeah I I got my

276
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,559
you know my my buddies out there and I I

277
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,039
love going to dinner with them too and

278
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,518
but the connect he has food there too so

279
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,240
if you haven't gone to the connect event

280
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,278
it's great there's mingling with people

281
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,519
that are intelligent that know the plant

282
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,759
that are passionate on all levels and I

283
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,078
feel like it's that that part about it

284
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,039
is great because I feel like there's

285
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,799
this mix of of vendors and people and

286
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,439
it's very casual and it's great yeah

287
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,479
honestly when I went to the event for

288
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,639
the second or third time the first

289
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,240
couple were still growing but the one

290
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,560
that I met you at the favin one yeah

291
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,799
there was 3 400 people there you know

292
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,359
and it's like everyone wanting to come

293
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,278
see I understand underlight was a huge

294
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,839
Topic at the time and everybody wants to

295
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,320

298
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,278
the yeah it's just everyone wants to

299
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,719
know more about it and I mean that the

300
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:50,919
proof is in the pudding with the fav and

301
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,360
that's what I like about it is like

302
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,919
there's actual we I have friends I have

303
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,278
friends and I can see firsthand the

304
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,039
results that they're getting and I love

305
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:58,919
it yeah you know that's what I like

306
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,399
because everyone says they have

307
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,078
something good you know there's so many

308
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,200
people out there that are like oh I got

309
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,078
this this is the best of this or the

310
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,278
best of that at the end of the day the

311
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,638
proof is in the pudding show me the

312
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,799
money show me the product then we can

313
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,159
talk about it you know you have the best

314
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,359
flower let's see it I you know it's like

315
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,559
I I like good flower I want you know but

316
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,320
everybody thinks their flowers is good

317
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,278
too so there's this ego when it's your

318
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,600
product as well and and these hydro

319
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:27,320
stores have to push their OS aside you

320
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,240
know and like perfect example like you

321
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,720
brought up faven right FV was from a

322
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,360
grower it started in a facility yeah but

323
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,720
guess what the facility didn't have it

324
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,879
dialed in correctly he ended up going to

325
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,480
a hydro store and the hydro store had a

326
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,559
couple more ideas that put it together

327
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,240
yeah and that's the communication that

328
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,479
we're talking about come to a hydro

329
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,680
store and transfer education you know as

330
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,839
Growers CU most of us are most of the

331
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,239
Growers ended up learning how to grow

332
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,120
where normally at a hydro store you know

333
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,680
maybe your buddies here and there but

334
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,000
they the origin came from normally a

335
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,559
hydro free internet it was all from

336
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,919
either your buddies or the hydro store

337
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,399
and a lot of times you had to talk about

338
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,679
it as like tomatoes Tomatoes Berkeley

339
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,639
under Garden I used to go there and it

340
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,399
was always referenced to vegetables you

341
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,759
can make vegetable references but the

342
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,799
second they wouldn't talk to you anymore

343
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,639
if you want to talk about wheat yeah so

344
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,838
and that's that's how serious they were

345
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,240
it was a lot of places were like that

346
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,959
yeah I had a hydro store down in Gilroy

347
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,839
and uh I think it was

348
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:36,679
2010 and we didn't talk about marijuana

349
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,680
it was a very closed lip situation you

350
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,679
know so but now it's growing you know

351
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,919
we're allowed to express ourselves we're

352
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,519
allowed to show each other but now in

353
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,759
this time what are we doing we're

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,679
closing up some some people are closing

355
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,039
up you know I see a lot of these large

356
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,198
Growers and they buy direct from every

357
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,719
single manufacturer which I understand

358
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,879
that philosophy is to cut your price

359
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,440
down we get it but if you can look

360
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,559
bigger and understand that you're never

361
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,800
going to be bigger than corporate yeah

362
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,599
and you should start to join a team to

363
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,240
an extent you know and that's what's

364
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,480
going to Keep Us Alive instead of being

365
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
a part of the race to the bottom right

366
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
because a lot of this is that race

367
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,240
especially if you're a cultivator you

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,320
know and I'm not I'm not a cultivator I

369
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,039
do cultivate okay but I'm not a

370
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,440
cultivator uh I'm a genetics guy yes and

371
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,278
so I have cultivation Partners I have

372
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,279
cultivation friends that do amazing

373
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,720
cultivation but I I'm blessed that I'm

374
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,439
not doing cultivation because it's

375
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
really difficult you know and it's like

376
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,320
the prices keep going down the inputs

377
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,320
keep going up in cost yes and same at

378
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,720
the hydro stores yeah every store is

379
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,399
challenging each other $2 doll cheaper a

380
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,879
dollar cheaper there has to be an end of

381
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,360
that you know and so what we're trying

382
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:56,198
to do is come out with branded quality

383
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,639
products that people know about and kind

384
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:02,879
of set a presidence of hey I would

385
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,278
rather fight my brother than my dad you

386
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,720
know and that's kind of what's going on

387
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:10,000
in our industry behind the scenes is hey

388
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,278
your hydro store is your brother the

389
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
neighbor you know it's okay to fight

390
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,838
that guy some days you know but are you

391
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,480
going to beat him up to where you can't

392
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,639
see no more no but when your dad comes

393
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,120
in he hits you one time and you're done

394
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,039
you know and oh my dad still like that

395
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,720
I'm not I won't fight my dad you won't

396
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,039
fight your dad why because you know in

397
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,000
the back of our mind you know

398
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,198
manufacturer they control everything in

399
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,240
the long run now is it their Duty and

400
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,758
their job to also help the stores it is

401
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,759
you know and so that's where I'm coming

402
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:46,318
at an angle um we have our United

403
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,879
Products um and Royal gold Sunshine we

404
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,159
we distribute for a lot of Manufacturers

405
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,120
Quest there's a lot of them out there

406
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:56,318
and so what we're trying to do is speak

407
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,519
to them and let them know that the

408
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,639
Growers are hurting right now yeah the

409
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,440
hydro stores are hurting right now the

410
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,318
only ones that aren't hurting as much

411
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
the

412
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,479
manufacturers and so it's time to kind

413
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,719
of depending on the manufacturer but

414
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,680
yeah correct you know the manufacturers

415
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,000
that are still doing well right now you

416
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:16,879
know there's margins that they're

417
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,839
holding on to you know and so like for

418
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:22,399
our nutrient line I'm going to cut out

419
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,319
all the margins yeah to give it to the

420
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,318
stores to actually make some money and

421
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:29,719
still give it to the end user cheaper

422
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:32,599
than what pretty much most the uh salts

423
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,759
out there on the market are you know so

424
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,360
that's just it's my give back back right

425
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,440
my stores every single store that's

426
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,318
supported me through this whole journey

427
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:46,160
that I've been on since

428
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:48,399
20145 you know I can't leave them right

429
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,318
it's loyalty you know and so those are

430
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,120
the things that I believe full-hearted

431
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,198
in is

432
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,159
actually supporting the people that

433
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,359
support you you know well let's talk

434
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,000
about your nutrient life for a little

435
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,600
bit okay so yeah it's Blended at custom

436
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,640
mag formulators um so I used to

437
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,360
distribute for Athena um ended that

438
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,839
ended that relationship about three

439
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,558
months ago with them just our views were

440
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,639
different and so what I tell all my

441
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:20,480
stores is hey it's time to get better so

442
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,959
what I did with custom a was I said hey

443
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,439
give me the highest input you guys

444
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,919
possibly can for this three-part

445
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,960
Baseline and I'm going to sell it at the

446
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,240
cheapest price possible and see where it

447
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,279
goes you know and the guys at custom a

448
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,599
are extremely brilliant at what they do

449
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,240
that's their craft their manufacturers

450
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:44,959
and so I have three groups working with

451
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,200
custom mag right now to do what research

452
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,798
and develop other products so we're not

453
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,600
done we're going to continue to take

454
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,480
this to another level so you just have

455
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:54,558
the three-part right now we have no we

456
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,599
have a full line yeah yeah so we have a

457
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:00,599
full line and so there's a PK powder in

458
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,319
there as well and we'll have a ph up and

459
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,839
then a finisher as well and then we're

460
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,839
actually for

461
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:11,240
our um hyper chloris acid we're working

462
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:14,798
with a couple companies uh one I'm not

463
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:18,000
going to divulge but another one is uh

464
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,400
clean grow um he has water Max and

465
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,079
that's kind of where a lot of products

466
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,960
were gener generated from in this

467
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:29,480
industry you know so with his and we can

468
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
go make it ourselves you you know but I

469
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,279
don't believe in that I believe in

470
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,640
helping people that are in the circle

471
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:39,639
you know and there's a there's another

472
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,120
uh hypochloric acid which isn't

473
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,080
hypochloric acid that's going to come

474
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,399
out and show a lot of people some things

475
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:51,079
so we're happy to have that in our

476
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,919
product line as well really cool yeah so

477
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,359
there's a lot of product on the market

478
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,320
and there's not a ton of quality I mean

479
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,038
I think it's gotten better through wreck

480
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,639
uh as as far as in California you know

481
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,919
because every state is so different are

482
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,600
you talking about flower or I'm talking

483
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,240
about flour okay specifically flow I

484
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,879
mean we can talk about extract extracts

485
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,359
the same thing okay we can talk about

486
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,840
the end product okay what would you

487
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,839
say uh the biggest problem with the

488
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:20,678
flower out there is you think inputs you

489
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:23,519
think uh drying and

490
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,759
curing back in the day drying and curing

491
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,359
yeah it was huge you know um but I would

492
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:32,200
say now it's more

493
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:35,599
it's grown to instead of doing 20 30

494
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,480
lights in a house it's grown to a, 500

495
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:44,279
lights it's very hard to manage

496
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:47,240
that size of rooms um but I would

497
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:51,240
say actually probably lack of education

498
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,440
for that size you know just having

499
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,480
Growers understand

500
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,519
that when you scale up to those levels

501
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,480
there's going to be change you know and

502
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,359
so the evolution of technology is

503
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,279
helping us you know because back in the

504
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,038
day we used all hand water you know like

505
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,359
I heard on the podcast couple that you

506
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:11,919
still hand water outside so do I you

507
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,319
know I just don't have marijuana plants

508
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,799
in my backyard anymore but I like to go

509
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,599
outside and that's my peace and my calm

510
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:23,599
and so but when people are in the garden

511
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,759
you know they're used to handw watering

512
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,399
now we're using drippers so things have

513
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,798
changed and as things Chang we sensors

514
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,519
now now we have sensors you know it's

515
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,599
like those things are game changers they

516
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,359
are you know and that's what's going to

517
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:39,519
make us better yeah you know but right

518
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:43,319
now is there a transition period yes

519
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,960
yeah is there's still some fire that 5

520
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,480
10 years ago we would have never seen

521
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,279
yes there is you know I smoked some the

522
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,798
other day I don't smoke too much anymore

523
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,839
but I got a cut from or one of one of

524
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,918
our buddies got a cut from you the

525
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,199
poison gusher yeah wow yeah yeah that's

526
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,600
a good one that's a great one no that's

527
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,400
not a good one that's a great one and

528
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:07,399
that's going to bring gas back yeah

529
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,640
that's that yeah so floral Flame's

530
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,278
growing that SF Canon's growing that yes

531
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,278
I got it from the SF Canon guys yeah

532
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:15,359
yeah yeah yeah it's good like they just

533
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:17,839
do a good job with everything they do

534
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,079
but I was floored I was like oh man I

535
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:23,918
need a uber home you know and I did not

536
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:26,158
create the poison gur okay but yeah so

537
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,200
but yeah it's part of the TC library

538
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,520
that that my partner has access to stuff

539
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,640
but yeah that's it's so you're in the

540
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,000
minority and I'm in the minority I like

541
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,880
poison gush I feel like not everybody

542
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,159
has turned on to poison gesturers why

543
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,039
it's not candy enough oh man same thing

544
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,960
with the you know the what is the the

545
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,960
new one the so they have a the new

546
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,720
strawberry banana they have a new

547
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,240
strawberry banana Skittles and it's not

548
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,919
candy enough for people and it's like

549
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,640
come on man it tastes amazing super

550
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,679
complex it's it's got a lot of funk to

551
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,440
it you know I like the poison gushers

552
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,278
for the same reason it's got fuel and

553
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,759
Funk it's it's special for that yes you

554
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:07,640
know and it's it's also one of those

555
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,359
ones that still burns down to the roach

556
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,320
and tastes amazing yeah and I I opened

557
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:15,678
the bag and I said you don't smell that

558
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,720
too often you know in this industry like

559
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,720
I was at the connected event with the

560
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,679
candies and I looked at all 20 jars you

561
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,120
know because I had the VIP pass to go in

562
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,960
the back and I looked at them all

563
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,759
fantastic all of them not going to knock

564
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,720
any of them you know but someone of them

565
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,240
were missing a nose I was knocking some

566
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,839
of them absolutely but you know and

567
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,640
there's some stuff and I feel like a lot

568
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,720
of that some of it's drawing some of

569
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,440
it's uh too much heat in the room I

570
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,240
think that's another problem is like not

571
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,000
getting your temps down and then when

572
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,079
you have a little too much heat that

573
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,798
that's a that's an issue there's a lot

574
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:50,798
more light than what we used to have

575
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,879
back in the day a lot more light

576
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,440
absolutely the light's different that

577
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,720
you know we I didn't even like LEDs at

578
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,600
first and I talked about on the show a

579
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,360
lot but HPS I'm still a HPS guy I love

580
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,399
HPS we got some HPS here we love r&amp; ding

581
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,000
stuff under HPS I like doing my

582
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,679
reversals under

583
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,839
HPS so there's nothing wrong with HPS

584
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,640
there isn't and I think in our facility

585
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,278
at our R&amp;D place we'll have HPS as well

586
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,960
yeah we're going to what we're going to

587
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:21,079
do is basically open it up to

588
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,640
manufacturers if you want your product

589
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:26,038
to be displayed here use the room well

590
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,520
and you got to use HPS because you love

591
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,519
it because it costs more to run than LED

592
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,960
it does but uh but if you love TPS and

593
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,278
you love the way the HPS makes the plant

594
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,038
Express then there's nothing wrong with

595
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,400
that yeah flow is going to sell you know

596
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,879
and if you have the turbs and you have

597
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,759
the smell that's what I think is missing

598
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,080
a lot in this industry right now is the

599
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,839
smell for sure for sure a lot of it's

600
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,119
missing the smell and flavor it's like

601
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,918
when you when you smoke it and we talk

602
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,558
about how Instagram's to blame for this

603
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:57,880
because you get these plants on

604
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,839
Instagram and it's just based on look

605
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,679
but at the end of the day it's like

606
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,158
really like what does it smell like what

607
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,159
does it taste like how does it make you

608
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,480
feel all those things you can't get from

609
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,840
a picture yeah and if you're not getting

610
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,120
the smell from it you're not going to

611
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,519
get the taste from it yeah you know they

612
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,879
go hand in hand they do but sometimes

613
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,278
the smell is more like I feel like

614
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,360
Skittles it smells good but it smokes

615
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:22,038
even better than it smells I and there's

616
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,439
a handful of things out there like that

617
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,519
but I started smoking again because of

618
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,720
the Skittles I hadn't smoked in about 3

619
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,240
4 years I just from our mutual friend

620
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,558
you get that skill it's like it's a game

621
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,679
changer I seen that and I was said okay

622
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,119
I guess I got to break it you know so

623
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,360
good it's so good I the problem with it

624
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:44,639
is when that's the if I have 20 or 30 or

625
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,359
40 different flavors that I'm smoking on

626
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,200
I get to that and I end up smoking all

627
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,599
that before I go into anything else and

628
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,600
like I might have a bunch of stuff that

629
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,839
might get old because I smoke the

630
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,879
Skittles first I like trying all kinds

631
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,079
of different stuff all the time and

632
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,440
depending on the day but that Skittles

633
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,439
is just sometimes when it's a good batch

634
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,360
it's like it just tastes amazing for me

635
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,360
when I see a good batch and I'm at the

636
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,079
right place at the right time then

637
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:10,000
that's where I'm I'm gonna smoke you

638
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,240
know normally it's in San

639
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,079
Francisco they know where I go and

640
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,519
that's you know it's a great place for

641
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,678
me to go hang out in a cool environment

642
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:21,038
and I get to see some of the absolute

643
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,080
top-notch weeds in this world yeah

644
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,519
that's there and there's so much good

645
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,480
stuff besides Skittles but Skittles has

646
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,119
a special place in my heart yeah but

647
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,200
yeah and there's so many genetics dude

648
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,119
that that are good and there's so many

649
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,679
that are just average you know I feel

650
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,239
like there's so many that need more work

651
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,120
to be done purple punch is one of those

652
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,640
ones it's one step away from being cool

653
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,639
and being good but by itself it's just

654
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,399
kind of eh but you can cross it to stuff

655
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,679
and you get some interesting expressions

656
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,278
and some really good stuff uh Oreos is

657
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,640
another one like people don't like Oreos

658
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,359
but you cross it to stuff you can get

659
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,440
some good stuff so it's like one or two

660
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:55,398
steps away from being amazing see and

661
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,480
that's your lane that's where I let you

662
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:59,359
go crazy and that's what we need is

663
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,079
people in our IND indry to kind of stay

664
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,319
a little more in their Lanes we got we

665
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,319
got Builders selling products but they

666
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,678
have no facility you know genetic guys

667
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:12,798
are going out there selling Rockwell and

668
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:16,080
their genetics and so that's kind of

669
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:18,720
what we want is to build up you're the

670
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,158
genetics man right let's build you up

671
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,759
let's put you out this is the beauty of

672
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:24,320
the White Market this is the beauty of

673
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,278
being able to do stuff legally is now

674
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,720
you can stay in your own lane and you

675
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,079
can be successful at it you can be

676
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:34,159
extremely is successful and you know if

677
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,000
you're at the top tier of your industry

678
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,679
of whatever you do whether it's genetics

679
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,119
or nutrients or you name it rock wool

680
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
you know whatever it is if you're at the

681
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,558
top you're going to be successful and

682
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,600
you can really hyperfocus on improving

683
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:49,079
genetics or improving but the guys that

684
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,000
try to do everything man they they end

685
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,439
up losing something yeah like right now

686
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,599
we're working on a 7030 I shouldn't be

687
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,640
saying this but we're working on a 7030

688
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:02,158
compression and everyone's like like how

689
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,480
can you can press perite you can't yeah

690
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,640
you know so guess what you got to go

691
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,679
outside the box guys you know just like

692
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,559
what I did with Sunshine way back in the

693
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,080
day yeah hey let's go outside the box

694
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:16,678
you guys gave us a bag of sunshine that

695
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:19,000
weighed 12 lbs the black one it used to

696
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,240
weigh 60 now it weighs 120 nobody can

697
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,119
carry this upstairs anymore you know so

698
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,120
I told them let's change the narrative

699
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,158
you know let's make it a white bag give

700
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,879
it to me at 60 PBS and see what we do

701
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,278
with it right we ended up you know

702
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,200
selling more White Sunshine than you can

703
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,798
imagine you know it's just changing the

704
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,399
narrative understand your lane stay in

705
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:43,079
that lane and focus and do the absolute

706
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,119
best you can do you know so what do you

707
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:48,558
prefer Rockwall what's your favorite

708
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,000
substrate cocoa soil or it's just I'm

709
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,038
one of those guys that likes all of them

710
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I I like everything for different uses I

711
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:55,319
believe different uses cause for

712
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,359
different things if you're going

713
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,759
Outdoors you should be in some Pete Moss

714
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,119
you know because need to hold that water

715
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,519
and retain the water um if you're inside

716
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,000
it's whatever you feel more comfortable

717
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,839
with me personally the reason why I want

718
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,240
to build a team is to educate people I

719
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,398
personally think Rockwell is going to be

720
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,440
gone in two years I know it's a crazy

721
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,639
subject for people to C I don't even

722
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,798
know if people can wrap their heads

723
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,759
around it but I really think it might go

724
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,000
away and you have to kind of look at the

725
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,640
not in years okay give me give it four

726
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
okay when Federal legalization comes

727
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,120
I believe it's going to be around four

728
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
years from now yeah I think there's

729
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,278
going to be a lot of changes you think

730
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,079
they're going to change that so no more

731
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,480
rock wall because it's environmentally

732
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:42,158
unfriendly right you know just like with

733
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,159
our LED lights if you don't know your

734
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,200
efficiency on your LED light in a couple

735
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,000
years you're probably going to have to

736
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,880
switch them well that's why HPS will

737
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
probably be going away unfortunately but

738
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,640
it's because

739
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,519
it is not efficient it's not not as

740
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,320
efficient and it creates more heat and

741
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,359
so you it creates more electricity and

742
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,839
you know I mean I I get that part

743
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,798
Rockwell we'll see it's it's used in a

744
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:10,439
so so much so heavily

745
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:12,960
used everywhere it is I went to a uh

746
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,240
Disney Disney World yeah and you go

747
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,200
through a little boat ride and there was

748
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,839
Rockwell in there and I was caught off

749
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,159
guard I'm like you know but there's

750
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,678
going to be a time and a place where we

751
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,278
have to elevate and get better so for me

752
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,038
I would say Rockwell is going to get

753
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:33,759
switched into Coco H interesting in due

754
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:36,278
time yeah I mean I like rockwolf for for

755
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,119
certain uses I like rockwolf for my

756
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:41,839
mom's and I like rockwool for

757
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,319
clones uh I'm always open to change but

758
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,398
yeah I mean we're working with grodan

759
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:48,960
right now too interesting outlook on the

760
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,959
industry because stuff can disappear

761
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,600
just like that and what are you gonna do

762
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,200
if you're buying all your stuff just say

763
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,359
you're buying everything from grodan and

764
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,240
grodan goes away you're lost as a a

765
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,479
cultivator you're going to have to go

766
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,679
back to the drawing you mean there's

767
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,399
going to be a learning curve when you

768
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,519
switch correct you know or just in

769
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:11,038
general not to be able to go to a hydro

770
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,359
store or bounce ideas off people yeah

771
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,119
hey what's everyone going to just like

772
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,599
in Oakland we were all told we were

773
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:21,000
allowed to use uh generators diesel

774
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,439
generators you can't use those anymore

775
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,038
uhuh none of that you see what I'm

776
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,038
saying and so the more you're around

777
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,278
people that are in this industry and

778
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:31,879
communicating you're going to educate

779
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:33,960
yourself to go to another level it's

780
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,519
being on The Cutting Edge it is and it's

781
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,240
about around right people that actually

782
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,640
care about furthering the industry you

783
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,720
know and that's what when I went around

784
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,880
the connect Community that's what I seen

785
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,679
I seen the next Evolution right where

786
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,320
the where it's going to go because that

787
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,798
for me as an owner of our company I

788
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,558
can't think about today even though the

789
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:00,480
day-to-day task I'm there every day yeah

790
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:02,720
myob two years down the road you know

791
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,038
and if you can't see two years down the

792
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,798
road then you should just probably not

793
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:09,079
own a business you know because things

794
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,398
change and if you don't know how to

795
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,240
Pivot at the right times then you'll end

796
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,079
up falling backwards the last two years

797
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,960
for us has been the most successful and

798
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,158
not too many people can say that yeah in

799
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,079
this industry so it's being around the

800
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,760
right people that have the right

801
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,319
direction yeah you know yeah I mean we

802
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,359
plan for the future and prepare for the

803
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,960
worst for the worst yes but you know we

804
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,158
still are yeah it's it's one of those

805
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,000
things you got to be creative and ready

806
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,440
to Pivot at any moment um but we pivot

807
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,759
with inside our realm just like you do

808
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,240
I'm sure some people want to Pivot from

809
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,558
this thing to this thing to this thing

810
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,798
they're going to do extract then they're

811
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,558
going to be breeders then they're going

812
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,558
to be stay in your lane yeah stay in

813
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,519
your lane and that's the beauty of you

814
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:56,000
know the times that's you know and we

815
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,519
are in amazing times it is amazing to a

816
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,638
degree you know the fact that cannabis

817
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:05,599
is legal yes to a degree it might not be

818
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:09,000
fully legal but we are talking about it

819
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,558
right here which is amazing yeah and the

820
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,880
path towards legalization like Federal

821
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:16,079
legalization we're we're on the way when

822
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,399
do you think that's going to happen uh

823
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,319
seven or eight years from now would be

824
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:23,558
my guess wow what do you think I think

825
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:25,839
four you think four yes well I think

826
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,359
interstate commerce is going to happen I

827
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,000
think baby steps right okay and so we'll

828
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,199
may maybe four maybe five that'd be

829
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,960
great I'm okay with that but I think

830
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,440
baby steps I don't we we have so much

831
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,399
red tape with everything that we do and

832
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,600
we're talking about rescheduling when we

833
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:45,518
should be talking about descheduling

834
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:47,599
well we're they didn't really reschedule

835
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,200
it that's a we've had a conversation

836
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,558
about it now there's actual a pathway

837
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,440
that we have to go down before that

838
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:56,158
actually happens it will happen for sure

839
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,960
it will it's just to where we can put

840
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,080
money in the banks and same thing with

841
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,278
State Commerce I mean Germany just went

842
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,000
wreck and so that's going to be huge for

843
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:07,319
Europe so all these dominoes have to

844
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,880
start to fall and in the United States

845
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,480
things take a little bit longer but the

846
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,760
fact that we are going schedule three

847
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,440
they're going to be a lot more research

848
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:17,319
and the fact that they can do research

849
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,679
and studies and that opens up a bunch of

850
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:21,398
money and I think that's an amazing

851
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,679
thing there's a lot of things I don't

852
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:25,759
like about the rescheduling I'd prefer

853
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,798
descheduling and I think most of us

854
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,440
would I would say descheduling yeah

855
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,679
but at the same time you have to

856
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,919
understand it's

857
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,759
still about money everything's about

858
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,720
money you know in with politics it's

859
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:44,720
politics politics and money Guess What

860
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,079
guys this industry makes a lot of money

861
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,600
yep guess what government's going to be

862
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:52,599

865
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:59,879
around with you know but at the same

866
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:02,759
time just like Amazon Prime you can

867
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,679
research and develop things and that's a

868
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,200
tax write off guys you know and so those

869
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,639
are the things that we're here to help

870
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,679
educate this industry yeah we're here to

871
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,519
further into a business not just hey I

872
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,398
go to the hydro store learn how to grow

873
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,358
a little bit and then take your packs

874
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,000
back to the hydro store and ask them can

875
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,878
you help me get rid of this those days

876
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,358
are five six years ago they're gone you

877
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,519
know hydro stores we got to get better

878
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:30,759
you know we have to educate our El to

879
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:33,079
the commercial level well and the

880
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,480
mediocre weed that was so easy to sell

881
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,879
10 years ago or 15 years ago that's long

882
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,838
gone man it's it's very competitive yeah

883
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:42,519
so you really need to constantly be

884
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,480
trying to improve what you're doing even

885
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:45,918
if you're the best yeah it has to be

886
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,199
constant like that has to be in the back

887
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,480
of your mind that I need to make this

888
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,638
product better whether you're making

889
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,878
genetics whether you're growing flower

890
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,878
whether you're making extract it doesn't

891
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,039
matter you have to have that mindset

892
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:59,078
that my product is good but it could be

893
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,639
better and I think that's so huge across

894
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,480
this whole industry and if you can

895
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,799
really keep that mindset you're going to

896
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,480
do well yeah uh at least you're going to

897
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,519
survive because the guys that were like

898
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,559
I'm just going to keep growing this

899
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,239
mediocre flower and you till the wheels

900
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,440
fall off well the wheels fell off like a

901
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:17,078
couple years ago yeah and I used to

902
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,000
coach football with the drill sergeant

903
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,839
and his motto was day by day we get

904
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,599
better and better till we can't be beat

905
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:24,320
Y and that's the truth if you wake up

906
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,599
every single day and try to get better

907
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,680
just like today I was only 15 minutes

908
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,760
late coming here better than the first

909
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:32,519
time you know but you know every grad

910
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,440
Improvement gradual Improvement just get

911
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,759
better every time you know yeah I've

912
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,440
been getting up early I get up early

913
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,040

914
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,480
get up 5:30 to well I try to get up at 5

915
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:47,159
I've been getting up at 5:30 set my

916
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,480
alarm for 5:30 but I've been traveling a

917
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,519
lot yeah so but I still try to maintain

918
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,838
that time even if I go to bed late yeah

919
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:56,880
it's a regimen yeah yeah it get you on

920
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,519
your p's and q's and then it tells you

921
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,039
those nights that you go to bed late you

922
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,880
should be going to bed earlier you know

923
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,880
your body tells you regret them the next

924
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,318
day but you force yourself to regret

925
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,358
those days yeah it's like when you go

926
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:10,759
out and you drink too much you know the

927
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:13,598
next day there's no sleeping in uh

928
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,280
anymore I wish yeah those days are done

929
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,559
I don't get to sleep in but that's okay

930
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,359
I mean there'll be time in my life where

931
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,440
I do get to sleep in if I want to but I

932
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,239
really enjoy waking up early and you

933
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,240
won't it'll be in a regimen you know you

934
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:27,000
see these old guys that are 80 90 years

935
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:28,078
old they still wake up at the same time

936
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,440
every morning

937
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,119
get their it's a it's a schedule and if

938
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,159
you have a schedule you actually end up

939
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,358
what living longer yeah well my my

940
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,199
father he's one of those guys he doesn't

941
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,679
sleep a ton he's never slept a lot there

942
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:41,759
was times in my life where I used to

943
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,838
sleep like four to five hours a night

944
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,720
yeah I did that I can't do that anymore

945
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:51,318
never um I used to drive a bus and do

946
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:55,399
that I drove a bus and a hydro store wow

947
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:59,039
in the very beginning and like city

948
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,559
bus VTA I used to drive the VTA bus from

949
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,480
3:00 in the morning till 11:00 and then

950
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:05,719
I jumped out and I started doing soil

951
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,480
deliveries wow you know and that's how

952
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:10,759
everybody knew me the guy in the truck

953
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,079
you know and you know we've grown and I

954
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,800
learned a lot in the last couple years

955
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:20,000
you know I learn that a team is what you

956
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,119
need this eye can't go that far you know

957
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,280
and so we're building a team that's the

958
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,680
best and it feels it not only feels good

959
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,040
to be part of something so much bigger

960
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,078
than yourself but it's essential

961
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:34,800
moving forward in this industry it is

962
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:37,680
you know cuz realistically one grower

963
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,119
they can change any laws at any time

964
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:44,239
yeah you know but now if we have 200 300

965
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,680

go to Florida and couple years uh

1013
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
coaching these kids single file lines

1014
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:44,838
two lines everywhere we walked you know

1015
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,920
and it all these kids hated us for the

1016
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:49,159
longest time and now they're all about

1017
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,240
17 18 years old and they come back to me

1018
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,559
and they're like coach Caputo you know

1019
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:55,318
and they come give me big hugs and it's

1020
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:57,400
cool because they understand what hard

1021
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:59,559
work is you know and that's what this

1022
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,280
indry is going to take to get to the

1023
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:04,759
next level it's hard work between

1024
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,079
everyone as a team you know

1025
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,040
right yeah it's it it it's funny because

1026
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,400
I feel like hard work skips Generations

1027
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,679
sometimes and with technology life has

1028
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,880
become easy and all this stuff it has

1029
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,759
you know I tell my kids every single day

1030
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,599
I don't care what you do in life I don't

1031
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,000
just be the best at it right strive for

1032
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,200
it you know I understand

1033
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,159
that the video games I got one son that

1034
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,879
thinks he's a video game expert and I'm

1035
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,399
like okay well then join one of those

1036
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,880
leagues you know but he won't you know

1037
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,440
because he's not the best at it so I

1038
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,880
might go back to school and get better

1039
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,960
you know right

1040
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,079
so well I think that's one of the

1041
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,519
beauties of today and being alive in in

1042
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,839
this era is that you can kind of keep

1043
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,639
Reinventing yourself no problem back a

1044
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:58,239
hundred years ago if you're a cobbler or

1045
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:00,159
if you're a tailor or or whatever your

1046
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,639
father did a lot of times but you had to

1047
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,920
do but now you can keep Reinventing

1048
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:05,480
yourself if if you want to re I mean I

1049
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,559
I've done it a bunch in my life you know

1050
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,240
Reinventing myself learning things that

1051
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,679
all kind of have tied together to lead

1052
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,959
me to where I'm at now which is nice not

1053
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,679
everybody does that some people jump

1054
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,760
from thing to thing and but food and

1055
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,919
cannabis go hand in hand but uh if if

1056
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,760
you don't get it right the first time

1057
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,318
you can have another career you can have

1058
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,800
another career and you can keep trying

1059
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:28,239
uh if you're if you're a hard worker and

1060
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,240
you don't enjoy it move on and try

1061
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,679
something else there's there's no shame

1062
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,199
in that and you're learning new skills

1063
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,719
you're just going to hear the word no

1064
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:38,759
more you know when you first start

1065
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,879
business you hear the word no a

1066
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,480
lot yeah and what happens is you learn

1067
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,358
to accept failure and realize that

1068
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,880
failure it doesn't end at failure you

1069
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,799
just got to get back up and keep trying

1070
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,119
uh sports are like that yeah martial

1071
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,760
arts are like that I tell my kids

1072
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,039
cannabis industry is definitely like

1073
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,680
that like I tell my kids the word no you

1074
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:02,400
actually get something out of the word

1075
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,639
no yeah when you're told no as a kid you

1076
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,519
can't go outside what do you do you

1077
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,920
start doing the dishes you do whatever

1078
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,759
you can in the house right to get that

1079
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,280
to turn to a yes you know and so guess

1080
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,319
what the word no isn't that bad when I

1081

white Thorn Rose and they're just see

1137
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,440
for the genetic side I stopped after it

1138
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,558
went from to train wreck did you like

1139
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,960
train wreck back when you were smoken I

1140
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,079
did but then we grew too much of it we

1141
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,440
didn't like it no more it's super strong

1142
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,240
yes yeah everything that I normally

1143
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,599
smoke is pretty much strong I want to

1144
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,118
smoke it and then eventually go to bed

1145
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:50,000
you know well when I was 18 teen I would

1146
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,400
smoke everything you know we ended up

1147
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,719
starting with some good stuff you know

1148
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,200
it was $480 an ounce though you know and

1149
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,919
you know but that was at 14 you know you

1150
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:03,960
start to learn and grow up and find out

1151
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,318
that hey you're not going to continue to

1152
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,358
pay $480 for an ounce you know you're

1153
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,800
going to find a way not to pay that to

1154
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:13,039
smoke every day yeah you know and that's

1155
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,039
just the the side of the hustle you know

1156
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,358
and that's what our industry does have

1157
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:20,199
our industry has a ton of hustle we just

1158
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:24,119
need to refine it into a business guys

1159
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:25,399
yeah that's it for sure yeah I mean do

1160
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,200
what you're passionate about at the end

1161
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,160
of the day just do what you're

1162
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:28,960
passionate about you're going to be

1163
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:30,960
happy you're going to be successful yeah

1164
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,199
and it's like what is success is Success

1165
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,440
being rich I mean success is defined so

1166
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:39,399
so differently by each person it's so

1167
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,039
subjective you know is is money success

1168
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,639
is being happy success is there some

1169
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,119
point in the middle of those things is

1170
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,078
that what success is owning a lot of

1171
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,519
[ __ ] some people want to collect this

1172
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,440
and collect that and I I was kind of

1173
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:54,239
like that when I was younger a little

1174
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,079
bit but uh success to me is happiness I

1175
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,000
feel like happiness to be able to do

1176
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,160
what you want to do I think that's

1177
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,559
success I went through all three of

1178
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:06,558
those in my lifetime so far and I'm

1179
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:09,240
starting to figure out to me success is

1180
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,160
when I pass away my funeral will be

1181
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:13,598
full

1182
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:16,679
have enormous amount of people at my

1183
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,119
funeral nice you know because that means

1184
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:20,480
it's not easy to go to a funeral

1185
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,640
normally people have moved away or

1186
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,559
whatnot but if you mean enough to

1187
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,039
somebody in someone's life yeah they

1188
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,480
come to the funeral you know well unless

1189
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,000
you outlive all your

1190
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,358
friends that's the tough one I've seen

1191
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,239
that W you know it's like that's not

1192
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:37,598
such a bad thing but yeah it's you know

1193
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,679
and I've had a couple friends die of

1194
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,240
cancer in the last month two days ago my

1195
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:45,838
buddy just found out he died of cancer

1196
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:48,279
and these long battles with cancer it's

1197
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,400
kind of wild it's crazy man my uncle had

1198
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,920
stage four cancer that he found out this

1199
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,519
was about 12 years

1200
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,159
ago guy does hardwood floors right they

1201
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:00,039
said hey we got two options you're going

1202
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,118
to pass away in two weeks or you can

1203
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,239
come up with

1204
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,519
$164,000 and take these two shots and

1205
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:09,759
see what happens he's still alive took

1206
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:13,519
the shots or took the shots yeah he's

1207
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,319
put those two in him and 164

1208
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:20,000
$4,000,000 for Two Shots yeah but now he

1209
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:22,880
gets to watch his son be on amateur on

1210
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,480
the PGA tour and he wish he probably

1211
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,039
died now no but you know it costs a lot

1212
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,280
of money to help his son right now

1213
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,920
medicine shouldn't be like that though

1214
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:35,000
it should not uh it makes me

1215
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,599
sad uh I think it's wrong personally and

1216
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,199
there's a bunch of that going on all

1217
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:42,039
over and that's to me that's greed yeah

1218
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,598
um and I understand people you know I

1219
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:45,920
understand people have to develop drugs

1220
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,079
and they cost a lot of money to develop

1221
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,920
but that's a tough one

1222
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,318
164,000 it's 82,000 a shot I was kind of

1223
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,240
I was kind of feeling like that with

1224
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:58,119
this whole covid thing man I thought it

1225
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,959
was bad you can't profit off people

1226
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:04,480
dying I don't believe in it you know

1227
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,519
like all the people that made the um

1228
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:11,079
shots during covid you know they told

1229
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:13,800
all of us it was free it was not free it

1230
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:16,160
cost us $40 and 20 it cost the

1231
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,119
government and it cost the taxpayers $20

1232
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,879
to the government or $20 to the

1233
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,640
government $20 to the taxpayers which

1234
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,599

store there's no toilet paper you got to

1239
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,400
be kidding me well that happened in our

1240
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,440
industry yeah and I was probably at

1241
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,639
fault for that I told everybody hey CO's

1242
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,039
going to happen you guys better go out

1243

going to run out yeah it did and they so

1245
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:50,798
we had people going to the Bay Area

1246
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,160
loading up on every single thing that

1247
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:55,280
they possibly could and then driving up

1248
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,358
to Sacramento and grabbing whatever else

1249
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,559
they could it was a day for the hydro

1250
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:02,519
for the

1251
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:04,519
industry was was an amazing time if you

1252
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,159
were in the industry of Co and you

1253
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,280
weren't successful you you should be out

1254
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,318
of the industry you're probably doing

1255
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,400
something wrong yes because it was very

1256
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:14,639
easy to be successful during covid there

1257
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,160
was a lot of people with money and they

1258
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,920
didn't shut down the dispensaries and

1259
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,558
people were excited to smoke people were

1260
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,358
excited to be growing uh drinking and

1261
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,680
all that good stuff but the hardest

1262
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:28,318
thing was trying to find products for

1263
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,239
The Growers yeah like they would switch

1264
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,519
anything at any time like if you're used

1265
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,959
to using groan I don't care if it's

1266
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:38,440
Calene give it to me and that's how it

1267
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,358
went you know it was whatever was out

1268
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,798
there I'm going to take every single

1269
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:44,639
thing off this shelf and put it in my

1270
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:49,318
grow room and we'll figure it out later

1271
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:52,239
you know so yeah that was we sprung

1272
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:54,558
sprung board into success through covid

1273
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,798
which is now it's time for us to give

1274
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,839
back you know yeah

1275
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:02,199
yeah it's always the right time to give

1276
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:04,880
back that's the beauty of it and

1277
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:07,558
honestly since covid it's been a

1278
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,160
whirlwind for this whole industry it's

1279
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,079
been up down down down now it's starting

1280
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,318
to come up a little you know there

1281
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,839
there's been hot spots and a lot of cold

1282
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,960
spots yeah it's been rough it's been

1283
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:20,759
rough for a lot of people and then the

1284
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,599
problem is is during

1285
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,400
covid uh on the cultivation side I L I

1286
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,440
saw a lot of people expanding expanding

1287
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,880
expanding thinking it was going to be

1288
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,480
like that for a long time and so then

1289
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,358
they either had to get rid of their

1290
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:37,240
second spot that they just built out or

1291
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:38,960
third spot or 100,000 square feet never

1292
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:41,879
got fully built out but they it was a

1293
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,679
great idea the concept was good but the

1294
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,920
market

1295
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:48,318
changed it does and I think you know

1296
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,798
going back to when it's federally legal

1297
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:53,279
that's when the boom will come again I

1298
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:57,039
was thinking four years because

1299
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,480
presidency you know yeah it's gonna be a

1300
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:03,719
president that is politics is in in our

1301
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,280
industry you know and to get somebody

1302
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:08,199
voted in I think Federal legalization is

1303
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,319
going to be on the next ballot not with

1304
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,919
the two that are going right now but on

1305
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,318
the next one after on the next one after

1306
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,280
that we will see yeah so you said seven

1307
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:19,599
to eight years seven to eight years yeah

1308
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm thinking that we're not ready for it

1309
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,200
I mean I'm ready for it I've been ready

1310
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,639
for it since 1996 do you think

1311
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:29,519
exportation at that time is going to be

1312
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:31,879
legal as well export Federal exportation

1313
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,719
to other countries yeah that's what I

1314
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,160
think I can't imagine us missing out on

1315
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:40,239
all this import

1316
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:42,719
export uh you know

1317
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:45,078
opportunity that Canada gets to

1318
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,719
experience potentially Mexico will get

1319
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:48,559
to experience before look like they

1320
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,039
might get to experience it before us

1321
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,440
Columbia gets to experience it now

1322
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,199
Germany

1323
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,559
Portugal um South Africa all these

1324
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:00,838
countries have import export

1325
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:02,319
so or or at least export yeah and uh I

1326
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:04,639
mean for us to miss out on this

1327
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,159
opportunity is silly because dude we

1328
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,759
have the best flower we have the best

1329
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,000
growers in my opinion yes we can argue

1330
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,920
this with some people but I think we

1331
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,960
have the best Growers and the best

1332
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,440
product in the world we should be able

1333
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,760
to export it so now but think about the

1334
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,200
liability or the viability of it is

1335
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,920
shipping say pounds from here to Europe

1336
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,639
they can also grow it in Europe too

1337
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:30,798
though but what thinking is it's going

1338
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:33,000
to be more your business genetics for

1339
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:34,239
sure that's where the springboard is

1340
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,358
going to happen I mean genetics can

1341
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:39,519
already be shared through yeah shared

1342
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:42,119
through tissue culture internationally U

1343
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:45,838
phytosanitary export yeah so all that

1344
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:49,440
stuff is already good to go gotcha

1345
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:51,400
especially on the hemp side yeah so it's

1346
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,200
yeah I mean we're the genetic stuff is

1347
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,079
already done but I think you should be

1348
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,639
you can go buy a Hershey bar in Europe

1349
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,079
that's from the United States

1350
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:00,960
why you know it's like why yeah

1351
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:02,640
McDonald's is there McDonald's is there

1352
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,880
that's way worse for

1353
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:08,199
you I mean in our reality you know it's

1354
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,880
like yeah we're talking about what's

1355
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:11,639
healthier and what's better for you you

1356
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,119
know there's still people that believe

1357
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:16,719
that cannabis is bad and causes lung

1358
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:20,680
cancer and stuff like that I mean I show

1359
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:22,118
me the money show me the proof so um you

1360
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:24,239
know I was reading this article the

1361
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:27,280
other day that psychosis and younger

1362
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:29,519
younger people if they smoke too much

1363
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,440
uh or smoke and and you know maybe

1364
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,639
that's true we're learning about it more

1365
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,559
but I feel

1366
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:39,598
like cannabis does more good than bad so

1367
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:43,920
as a plant I think it it helps people I

1368
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:47,240
think that for so many conditions it can

1369
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,119
be a alternative to something that could

1370
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,879
potentially cause cancer or get you sick

1371
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,880
or or be a lot worse off for you or

1372
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,960
strung out on drugs or strung out on

1373
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,640
drugs or yeah I mean pain pills dude

1374
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,519
like as a as a substitute for pain pills

1375
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:03,558
I think it's great great and maybe it's

1376
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,318
not for everybody for that but the ones

1377
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:07,359
that are they deserve to be able to use

1378
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,679
that you should have an option you know

1379
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,598
when you force somebody to do something

1380
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,000
that's what we're going to do when we

1381
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,760
come out with the stores we're going to

1382
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,119
have good better best when you force

1383
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,480
someone to do something they're going to

1384
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:20,400
revert and do what they want to do right

1385
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,519
nobody likes to be forced to do anything

1386
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,079
in this world don't tell me what to do

1387
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:27,519
exactly that's the new world you know

1388
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,760
cuz it all came from our telling us this

1389
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,079
is what you're going to do Mom and Dad

1390
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,240
my way are the highway we used should

1391
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:35,920
tell that to my mom all the time Mom

1392
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:37,719
this world is not your world you know

1393
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,480
but well so much of this world is

1394
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:42,199
counter in so much of this reality is

1395
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,480
counterintuitive that you think it's one

1396
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:44,798
way but really it's the complete

1397
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,679
opposite once you have the full

1398
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:50,519
perspective yeah you know it's like you

1399
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:53,118
want your kids to live a easy life and

1400
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:54,759
not to suffer I think a lot of people

1401
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,720
you know and I'm not generalizing with

1402
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,720
you but just you know a lot of people

1403
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:00,719
don't want their kids to suffer and

1404
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:03,598
unfortunately they give their kids too

1405
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:06,159
easy of a life and that causes suffering

1406
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,559
and so it's it has the exact opposite

1407
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:11,399
effect but we're so often

1408
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,440
looking at a symptom rather than the

1409
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,480
problem so we look at this is like this

1410
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,599
is the the problem but no that's just a

1411
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,880
symptom of a much bigger problem and it

1412
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,680
it's happening all over the place and

1413
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:26,400
most of us just focus on what we can see

1414
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:30,318
and not what took it to bring that issue

1415
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,200
to be a problem yeah it's codling yeah

1416
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,599
it's coddling coddling because we want

1417
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:37,399
better for our children yeah you know

1418
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:40,200
but at the same time that hard work has

1419
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,480
paid off for us you know the Sweat The

1420
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:46,480
Tears sleeping four hours having a bus

1421
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,838
job as well as selling soil you know

1422
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,798
right those are the things that make you

1423
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:52,078
as a person yeah you know yeah and

1424
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:53,400
they're going to make you appreciate and

1425
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,318
the other thing is is like if you don't

1426
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,039
experience a hard life and to some

1427
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:59,000
degree not in your whole life but if you

1428
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,880
don't experience the opposite you don't

1429
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,039
really appreciate the good life it's

1430
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,960
just you know the the sour and the sweet

1431
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,079
you know if you don't ever experience

1432
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,400
the the sour the sweet will never be as

1433
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:14,400
sweet that's crazy I say this all the

1434
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,838
time I tell everybody this is my line

1435
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,639
you know why we have bad days so we know

1436
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:20,400
what a good day is yeah if you always

1437
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:22,519
have good days you don't know what a bad

1438
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,480
day is and and then if something hits

1439
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:26,960
you out of nowhere that it's going to

00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:23,598
to find out he made $25 million from

1463

the roast I mean there's not a l of guys

1465
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:28,760
that wouldn't do the roast for 25

1466
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:31,119
million that's why he's sitting there

1467
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,839
smiling thinking about that 25 million

1468
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,640
yeah I don't think I would do it if I

1469
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:37,440
was him though man that guy got too much

1470

bitcoin so oh did he you know I'm a

1474
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,240
Niners fan but I got a lot of respect

1475
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,720
for Brady as being the goat you know

1476
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:49,439
it's pretty impressive what he's done as

1477
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,719
a

1478
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,440
quarterback uh he's he's quite the

1479
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,399
character you know what you lose $40

1480
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,280
million in crypto I don't honestly don't

1481
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,880
follow that yeah so he lost a [ __ ] ton

1482
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,079
of money in crypto no way so yeah they

1483
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,640
in fact there was a couple jokes about

1484
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:07,798
it on the roast so oh yeah I watched

1485
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:10,598
most of the roast but yeah I'm a diard

1486
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:12,639
Michigan fan so I love Brady yeah I love

1487
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:15,240
the whole story the underdog br's from

1488
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:17,159
the bay area he is Sarah High School

1489

yeah well everyone wants together

1493
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,239

01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,318
stuff a lot of good local stuff and I

1599
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:44,679
remember some of the stuff up there the

1600
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:47,079
permafrost senx was up there that was a

1601
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:48,919
pretty popular one they had Alaskan

1602
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:51,200
Thunder [ __ ] that's where I saw that the

1603
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,760
first time I think that's what I ended

1604
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:56,399
up driving back up to Washington with

1605
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,119
four of my buddies in a S10 truck nice

1606
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,960
it was it was more of a trip but we went

1607
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:03,798
up there to go pick up a little QP of to

1608
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,760
Washington and we were 16 years old you

1609
01:03:03,798 --> 01:03:08,519
know come back down and cuz the prices

1610
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,359
was was different from up there to down

1611
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:12,440
here it was cheaper it was a lot cheaper

1612
01:03:10,358 --> 01:03:16,318
a lot cheaper I think back then we paid

1613
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:19,480
$700 for a QP wow now or down here it

1614
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:20,880
was probably like ,100 at that time yeah

1615
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,559
yeah I remember those it was like that

1616
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:27,440
for a long time 1100 1,000 1100 1200 for

1617
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,400
QP we pretty much doing what all the

1618
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,880
Growers are doing now driving from hydro

1619
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,079
store to hydro store we probably spent

1620
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,559
the same amount of money on gas driving

1621
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:38,119
up there you know but it was for the

1622
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:40,119
experience you know for sure so it's a

1623
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:43,440
good drive I just made that drive did

1624

1631
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:04,358
hours and then drove back I've done some

1632
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:06,639
crazy [ __ ] driving yeah I mean I when I

1636
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,679
yeah stop in the bay drop my buddy off

1637
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,000
drive all the way down to Riverside boom

1638
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:21,199
boom boom drive back to the house which

1639
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,920
was another [ __ ] six hours yeah from

1640
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:28,558
Riverside long long days yeah my worst

1641
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:30,240
one ever was was I drove down to I had

1642
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,798
like eight pallets of soil on me drove

1643
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:35,479
out to Anza out in the desert out in

1644
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:37,679
down La drove back to a hydro store in

1645
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,240
La picked up eight more pallets and

1646
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,159
drove back out to Anza and then ended up

1647
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,399
driving home all in the same day made a

1648
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:47,679
home 24 hours so wow I would never do

1649
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,880
that again never you learn you grow up

1650
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,919
and you learn you grow up and you learn

1651
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,480
and when you're younger you're

1652
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,920
invincible so you're like whatever take

1653
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,920
I'm taking on the world I don't care I

1654
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,440
probably almost died coming home on the

1655
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:02,358
152 yeah but hey the things you do to

1656
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,880

hours and you know it's almost a day of

1666
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:29,519
driving to go down for the weekend to go

1667
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:32,079
to Mexico I I can't do that anymore D

1668
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,639
can you imagine doing what we used to do

1669
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,318
we can't like no that's that's getting

1670
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:39,278
older you know and understanding I maybe

1671
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:41,519
we we just have these mental limitations

1672
01:05:39,278 --> 01:05:42,920
maybe we could do those things maybe I

1673
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,960
don't I know I don't have any time

1674
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,159
anymore like I had a buddy ask me the

1675
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,358
other day he goes you don't smoke that

1676
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:50,759
much I said I don't have time yeah and I

1677
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,558
and honestly I don't like to forget

1678
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,599
things I have a lot on our plate you

1679
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,400
know so if I forget something I feel

1680
01:05:54,599 --> 01:06:00,640
like I did someone wrong you know so I

1681
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,000
really keep keep smoking to nighttime

1682
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:05,278
for now until I can take a little more

1683
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,039
workload off me you know yeah it just

1684
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:08,480
depends on the day for me every day is a

1685
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,240
little different up in Washington I

1686
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:14,119
smoked a lot going there memorial for

1687
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:17,759
one of my buddies yeah and uh yeah so we

1688
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:20,640
smoked a lot yeah no I from 14 to 22 I

1689
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:24,799
probably smoked every single day but 20

1690
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:28,838
maybe 30 days you know and it was sick

1691
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:30,440
with yeah maybe you know or I couldn't I

1692
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:33,358
didn't have money that day or something

1693
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:35,760
you know but from 14 to 22 smoking every

1694
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:37,038
single day it's hard you know 14 to 22

1695
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,480
we had droughts where we couldn't get

1696
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,440
weed some days it just wasn't there like

1697
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,240
nobody had weed everyone was looking for

1698
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,559
it and they don't have that anymore

1699
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:47,318
there's no such thing as a drought or

1700
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:49,200
having it's been over a year since I I

1701
01:06:47,318 --> 01:06:50,719
didn't have it's been a lot more than a

1702
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,038
year but since I didn't have any weed in

1703
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,399
the house it's like I've always got

1704
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:54,640
something to smoke you know could you

1705
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,480
imagine having to call four or five

1706
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:59,038
hooks again to get a 20 sack cuz this

1707
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,639
guy doesn't have it you know it's like

1708
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:03,039
what we're calling four or five guys to

1709
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,239
see the quality now it's not the

1710
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,799
availability availability is there you

1711
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:10,759
know now it's quality well and then it's

1712
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:12,358
hard yeah I mean quality is still not

1713
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,839
accessible for everybody most people

1714
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:15,920
don't like the stuff that we're able to

1715
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,199
get from our mutual friend most people

1716
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,358
don't even get to see the stuff on that

1717
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,960
quality on a daily you know that's why

1718
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:24,038
it's very easy for me not to smoke cuz I

1719
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,519
go to a lot of other facilities and they

1720
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:27,760
try to give me stuff don't get me wrong

1721
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,519
wrong it's still good you know but

1722
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:34,000
there's a huge difference between good

1723
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:35,480
and wow night and day and then effect

1724
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,679
you know it's like most of his stuff is

1725
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,838
has a good effect yeah some of it's

1726
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,519
really

1727
01:07:38,838 --> 01:07:43,838
strong that the Cherry

1728
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,759
guava is that a strong one it's good

1729
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:48,480
it's strong yeah I like it because it it

1730
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,400
has a good effect to it okay so yeah

1731
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,039
it's strong it burns clean it tastes

1732
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,798
gray burns down to the roads but yeah

1733
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:59,920
it's it's got It's it's pretty potent

1734
01:07:55,798 --> 01:08:02,639
yeah yeah the one before the um gushers

1735
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,559
was uh g41 I don't know if there was a

1736
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,519
cross with it or not but that was the

1737
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:09,599
last one that I smoked and they said a

1738
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:12,920
cut came from you and I was like oh wow

1739
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:16,199
you know but see what you're doing with

1740
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,880
upping the genetics game and it's

1741
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:20,358
actually helping the flower at the end

1742
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,480
you know so that's kind of what we're

1743
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:26,279
trying to build in this whole Community

1744
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:29,798
yeah is a to z right we want Builders we

1745
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:32,839
want advisers we want genetics we want

1746
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:35,319
Growers hydro stores everybody together

1747
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:38,519
as a unit yeah and that's where we could

1748
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:40,960
see ourselves furthering this industry

1749
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,880
because without you going and having

1750
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,399
conversations with another genetics guy

1751
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,880
James yeah you might not learn something

1752
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:49,039
for sure you know well we always got to

1753
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,119
learn it's constantly evolving and the

1754
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:53,920
more we communicate with each other the

1755
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:55,719
more education that comes out you know

1756
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,679
and that's what I see the hydro stores

1757
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:02,759
going back to being eventually is like a

1758
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:05,759
Transportation Hub for Education yeah no

1759
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:07,238
more packs guys you know education a

1760
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,759
grower is going to come into there and

1761
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:12,599
he's gonna say something now you can be

1762
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:15,679
the person that transfers it to another

1763
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:18,279
grower you know I kind of see the future

1764
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:20,158
you in my weird way but going into the

1765
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,560
grow shop they have the big screen like

1766
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:24,278
in Back to the Future when he went into

1767
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,560
the library and it was like was it back

1768
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:26,719
to the future I can't remember it was

1769
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,440
one of those movies where they went in

1770
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,359
the

1771
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:32,798
library anyway I could imagine going in

1772
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,798
a grow shop where they have the AI and

1773
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:36,600
it's fully trained in whatever questions

1774
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:39,439
you have and it can answer the questions

1775
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,719
it's gonna be there yeah I we're not too

1776
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:44,838
far off yeah I think the whole reason

1777
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,960
why we're paying fast food people $20 an

1778
01:09:44,838 --> 01:09:49,198
hour is because they're going to be

1779
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:52,239
taking our order pretty soon yeah you

1780
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:54,399
know yeah AI is wild computers are you

1781
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,839
know really evolved and it's only just

1782
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:59,119
going to keep getting more crazy

1783
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:01,560
genetics breeding with AI is the future

1784
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,960
for sure cuz I went to a vertically

1785
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,320
integrated in San Francisco it's a

1786
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,279
produce

1787
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:12,759
facility no one's allowed inside of it

1788
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:15,639
but robots wow and it's it it it opened

1789
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,000
up my eyes if you know to a whole

1790
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:20,159
another level our industry isn't just

1791
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
going to be cannabis it's going to be

1792
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:24,158
the traditional side all coming together

1793
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,920
we use the same products yeah that's why

1794
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:30,079
I see some of these stores turning into

1795
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:32,399
like igc's independent garden centers

1796
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:35,479
why not I grow tomatoes with age old and

1797
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:39,158
Royal gold you see what I'm saying I I I

1798
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:41,359
have a I have a a crop of uh corn yeah

1799
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:43,399
from Royal gold and it was the best

1800
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:45,439
tasting corn that we've ever had my

1801
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:47,839
daughter has a picture she was like four

1802
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:49,519
years old we geek out in a garden

1803
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,520
together me and my daughter you know

1804
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,360
yeah I use vital I use Royal gold and

1805
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,960
for for vegetables like for sure and a

1806
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:59,559
they get age old too

1807
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:02,239
yeah it's going it's going to kind of

1808
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:04,440
cross path and it's okay look at like

1809
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:06,759
BFG they came into our industry they're

1810
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:08,559
a traditional distributor now they're

1811
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,640
coming into the hydro sector and now

1812
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:14,039
they're merging with Hawthorne you know

1813
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:16,920
all this is showing you the writings on

1814
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:18,399
the wall guys this industry is coming

1815
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,079
together and instead of it being a

1816
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,039
billion dollar industry it's going to be

1817
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,399
a trillion dollar industry well that's

1818
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:27,840
only because the dollar is getting

1819
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:30,319
devalued so much yes I

1820
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,920
agree but that's what inflation is

1821
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,119
correct it's not

1822
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,920
that the money's worth less as the

1823
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:37,439
dollar is going down the product's still

1824
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,760
worth the same it's just valued

1825
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:42,879
differently yep so if you had one advice

1826
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,119
for your younger self that was first

1827
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,440
coming into the industry what would that

1828
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:49,439
piece of advice be not believe in myself

1829
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:51,678
but

1830
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:55,879
more understand you

1831
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:59,800
have a key to a huge Co-op

1832
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:01,920
and listen more to what the people

1833
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,719
around you are saying you know for a

1834
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:07,679
long time I was running the business by

1835
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:11,198
myself so I was kind of narrow minded

1836
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:13,119
and just driven on what my task was

1837
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:16,039
because I couldn't really look outside

1838
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,719
the box I had I first company that I

1839
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:19,600
really started dealing with in this

1840
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:22,319
industry was crop protection services

1841
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,679
they they now changed their name to act

1842
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,079
nutrient but this guy Mike Johnson

1843
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:30,199
coolest guy in the world man he came in

1844
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:31,760
and he said how much is this Cal Mag and

1845
01:12:30,198 --> 01:12:34,079
it was one gallon and I I don't know

1846
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,039
know it was 25 30 bucks he goes I can

1847
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:39,119
get you 55

1848
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:40,800
pounds of dry fertilizer that can make

1849
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:43,359
thousands and thousands of gallons for

1850
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,920
the same price you know so I ended up

1851
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:49,198
going to all the hydro stores and I said

1852
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:52,920
hey guys look it dry fertilizer and this

1853
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:54,158
is 2013 yeah and everybody said no

1854
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,480
nobody's ever going to come back we're

1855
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:57,638
not going to be able to make any money

1856
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:59,359
now you know but now I turn to them and

1857
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:01,039
I look at them all and I'm like how much

1858
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,238
money are you guys making off these

1859
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:05,158
products now a couple dollars yeah

1860
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:07,319
everyone's going to Salt so just believe

1861
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:10,319
and trust in the circle around you

1862
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:14,559
there's educated people around you and

1863
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:19,158
stay open-minded to all aspects of their

1864
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:20,600
kind of critiques you know nice yeah so

1865
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:24,519
who was the first salt company that had

1866
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,840
salt nutrients I know there so G had

1867
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,320
Flora Pro

1868
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,639
and then but even think uh over in

1869
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,880
Europe I think uh was it front row front

1870
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:35,760
row EG had one they had one too but I

1871
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,440
think F they they came for veg Bloom

1872
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,360
right so V Bloom yes I'm sorry ve Bloom

1873
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:42,919
might be the first first but uh you know

1874
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:45,000
Aran and Greenhouse they've got their

1875
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,719
Greenhouse feeding I believe Greenhouse

1876
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,880
feeding was the first but I mean the

1877
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:51,319
concept is great it's like it's so silly

1878
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,880
that we mix these powder nutrients with

1879
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:56,000
water and then they have this [ __ ]

1880
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,319
crazy footprint and the the carbon

1881
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,920
Footprints way bigger when you add water

1882
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:02,319
than if you ship powder and you can kind

1883
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,840
of ship that anywhere of the world yeah

1884
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,279
and the concept's beenin around we we

1885
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,800
had some po powder additives and stuff

1886
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:11,158
like that but you know it's it's funny

1887
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,600
it took us so long to go all the way

1888
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:14,759
back to the beginning because it you

1889
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,760
know that's where it started and now

1890
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,520
it's amazing with these buffers and all

1891
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,320
these other things where you could just

1892
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:24,520
use I mean I've used some one part stuff

1893
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:26,759
that you know mediocre results there's

1894
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:30,199
an array way of things that we're trying

1895
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,760
right now it's going to evolve and the

1896
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:34,039
people in the aide have been doing this

1897
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,440
for years it's picking some of their

1898
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:39,359
brain getting away from the name brands

1899
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,198
that we're so stuck on well there's the

1900
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:43,719
Cannabis tax right so if you look at the

1901
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:46,319
a products that are the exact same

1902
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:49,239
products sometimes they are 4X of what

1903
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:51,158
they cost in the a world uh and that

1904
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:52,799
just goes across the board and that's

1905
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:54,439
what we're doing with our nutrient lines

1906
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,880
we're taking out the margins if you look

1907
01:14:54,439 --> 01:15:00,198
at the a industry there's only a couple

1908
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:03,359
nutrients out there yeah and they're the

1909
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:05,319
ones that understand we're not selling

1910
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,639
Secrets no more guys we're selling

1911
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:10,439
convenience we have to allow these

1912
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:12,359
strawberry Growers to do what grow

1913
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,559
strawberries and put it on the table you

1914
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:16,158
know that's the same thing as our

1915
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,039
industry now you know it's it's evolving

1916
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:21,079
to where we're not selling Secrets no

1917
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:24,000
more guys these liquid fertilizers these

1918
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:26,679
other name brand fertilizers you can get

1919
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,399
them for a lot cheaper at your egg place

1920
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:31,719
you know it's reality well and cannabis

1921
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:33,839
Farmers the the glory and all this stuff

1922
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:35,600
it's like they're becoming tomato farmer

1923
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,039
yes they're becoming strawberry Farmers

1924
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,199
they're being they're be they're going

1925
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:43,560
to become part of the the egg model to a

1926
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:45,839
degree you know wineries wineries Cut

1927
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,400
Flower business has gone out of business

1928
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,920
for the dude that's where all the greenh

1929
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:52,000
houses came from is cut flowers I've

1930
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,719
been walking so many green houses trying

1931
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,600
to get all the rickety ones are from cut

1932
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:59,960
flowers cut FL man there's one up here

1933
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,679
in Half Moon Bay but it has a Aqua Duck

1934
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,719
and they grow butter lettuce and they

1935
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,639
sell it to the Ritz Carlton so I was

1936
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:08,039
really intrigued by that because that's

1937
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:11,239
where I see our business going we are a

1938
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:15,238
couple steps ahead of the a side when it

1939
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:17,599
comes to cultivating inside you know

1940
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:21,238
outside no they still have the upper

1941
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,159
hand on us you know so it's just how to

1942
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:25,359
take out the margins in this industry

1943
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:28,479
streamline it to where you you can have

1944
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,880
a really reliable product at an

1945
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:31,839
effective price that's what we're

1946
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:34,239
looking for totally well you know the

1947
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,840
double Stacks they came from lettuce GRS

1948
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:37,919
yes and now there's like triple I've

1949
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,600
seen triple Stacks at mango

1950
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,960
spot and I just that's a long that you

1951
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,920
got to go way up to it's a little it's

1952
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,439
not safe can it's not safe it's not safe

1953
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,560
you know but everyone's got their own

1954
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:51,000
way of doing it there's there's no two

1955
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,000
ways to I mean there's so many different

1956
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,639
ways to skin a cat what do you think the

1957
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,960
timal

1958
01:16:56,639 --> 01:17:00,920
price per

1959
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,359
pound best quality product where is that

1960
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:04,840
going to come from your opinion I think

1961
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,719
there's still going to be the boutique

1962
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,480
product that sells for top dollar that's

1963
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,279
not produced there's going to be the

1964
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,678
either limited market or the false

1965
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:14,319
limited market on it that they control

1966
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:16,480
the amount of product that goes out so

1967
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:19,119
it's very limited and it just sells like

1968
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:22,359
crazy uh which is like the DOA stuff

1969
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:23,960
right now yeah you know deep east the

1970
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:26,479
stuff that they're pushing it's like

1971
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,158
that it's very limited and I think

1972
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,399
that'll still fetch a high dollar no

1973
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:31,839
matter what whe you know especially you

1974
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,920
know wreck where it's top quality

1975
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,440
product but if it takes $300 to produce

1976
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,840
a pound which I don't see that changing

1977
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:42,158
much unless the dollar goes down more

1978
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:43,880
which it will but yeah but uh if we're

1979
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,519
looking at it from that perspective you

1980
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:49,480
know take take cost 300 how much do you

1981
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:51,920
need to stay profitable before you go

1982
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:53,759
that business you know and so where's

1983
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,000
that where's that line especially with

1984
01:17:53,760 --> 01:18:00,199
taxation yeah and everything else so I

1985
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,719
don't know I think substitute Lighting

1986
01:18:00,198 --> 01:18:03,839
in a

1987
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:05,439
greenhouse I couldn't agree more mixed

1988
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,159
light is the best I think it's the

1989
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:09,158
future you know I think I talked about

1990
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:10,679
it on my last podcast but I think that

1991
01:18:09,158 --> 01:18:14,198
mixed light is the future I think you

1992
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:16,480
can get a amazing quality product and

1993
01:18:14,198 --> 01:18:19,238
for for a lower cost yeah and you're

1994
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:21,638
using the Sun and so you're getting the

1995
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:25,399
the lights's amazing there's drawbacks

1996
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:27,159
on both sides but I see

1997
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:29,879
the large scale going that way

1998
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:33,238
eventually I've been walking Farms all

1999
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:36,279
through Selena Watsonville Half Moon Bay

2000
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:39,399
and I've got a better understanding you

2001
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:42,238
know there's some really high quality

2002
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:43,920
glass house projects out there dude you

2003
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,359
know what those cost per square foot to

2004
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,359
build it's crazy the venos like the

2005
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:51,079
Dutch green houses are it could be more

2006
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:53,238
expensive and a lot of times is more

2007
01:18:51,079 --> 01:18:55,479
expensive than an indoor facility

2008
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:58,799
buildup but you're going to save money

2009
01:18:55,479 --> 01:19:01,599
in the long run on power you are and a

2010
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,440
power is a lot cheaper than commercial

2011
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,520
power in the city yeah if you got an

2012
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:07,279
extra 10 million or 15 to throw at it

2013
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,480
it's no problem you but guess that's

2014
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:12,000
where corporations going to go so that's

2015
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:14,759
where us coming together as a team and

2016
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,800
figuring out how do we get a sop at $200

2017
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,039
a pound that's where communication and

2018
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,719
challenging each other yeah to get

2019
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:23,158
better right that's where we have to go

2020
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:25,239
or guess what you might as well just

2021
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:27,399
sign over the keys to corporate

2022
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:28,879
you know and let them take it but we're

2023
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:30,638
resilient we're Fighters and we're not

2024
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,000
going to turn it over that easy I

2025
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:35,039
promise you not my group no I guarantee

2026
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,639
you no and those glass green houses are

2027
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:40,079
pretty cool you can tint them with they

2028
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:42,480
they have like uh the the planes that

2029
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,800
that spray you can have them spray your

2030
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:46,519
your tint on there yes the different

2031
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,920
seasons they have different sprays and

2032
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:50,120
stuff like that it's really cool and

2033
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,600
they have misters that go back and forth

2034
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:52,960
oh man there's some really cool things

2035
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,440
so that's what I'm trying to get a

2036
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:58,560
couple guys from our group into a couple

2037
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:00,759
facilities like that yeah and they

2038
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,360
there's one down there it has 70,000

2039
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:06,440
square ft has 1300 lights in it to see

2040
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:10,799
the difference right see the what your

2041
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:13,238
Roi is figure out what's a better

2042
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:16,400
situation for you financially because

2043
01:20:13,238 --> 01:20:18,399
everybody might want these boutiques but

2044
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:20,119
one day it might not fetch that dollar

2045
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,039
anymore there there will there's always

2046
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:24,719
going to be Boutique but there will

2047
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:25,719
always also be the middle range and

2048
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,600
that's where the race of the bottom

2049
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:30,399
occurs yeah so you either want I mean if

2050
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,079
you're a small boutique company you got

2051
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:34,759
to stay small boutique you can't because

2052
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,960
you'll never compete on Price ever ever

2053
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,440
you know it's like these guys will be

2054
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,279
able to produce stuff for 200 and

2055
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,759
they'll be able to sell it for 400 500

2056
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:44,800
yeah I mean they'll be able to put out

2057
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:48,360
you know $ five a decent quality if they

2058
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,039
want to buy them at 7-Eleven dude you

2059
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:52,960
think that's the future 7-Eleven I do

2060
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,399
the face recognition and the screen

2061
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,119
where you just put it in there and it's

2062
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:58,519
a dispenser that or delivers no I think

2063
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,880
drone deliver is definitely going to

2064
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:04,639
happen there's there you're going to see

2065
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,840
it on normal shelves eventually like

2066
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,400
drone delivery probably already is

2067
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,840
happening I just don't know about it

2068
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:10,920
it's probably going to be like vending

2069
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:13,880
machine yeah to an extent like you're

2070
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:17,319
saying that a 7-Eleven you know but now

2071
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:19,359
how long can you really gauge the shelf

2072
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:20,599
life inside that vending machine now

2073
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:22,920
dude once they dial it in it's

2074
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:25,120
refrigerated inside there then it mon

2075
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,639
later you see that's ution of this

2076
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:28,158
industry but I'm looking forward to the

2077
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,480
day where they don't even get like the

2078
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:30,638
consumer doesn't even necessarily want

2079
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:32,479
to see the weed they don't care they

2080
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,600
want to get that pre-roll that burns

2081
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:36,519
amazing and so then you can give them

2082
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,480
the stuff that necessarily right now it

2083
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,760
wouldn't fit the bill because they they

2084
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:41,638
have to see the product but if it was

2085
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,000
put in a pre-roll and they smoked it

2086
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:45,480
they'd be like this is the best thing

2087
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,158
ever so or the rosin you know I mean we

2088
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:49,399
already have that with rosin but I feel

2089
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:52,079
like with pre-rolls and we're getting

2090
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:54,039
there but it takes it takes consumer

2091
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,319
trust that's what I was just going to

2092
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:58,439
tell you you know how you gain that

2093
01:21:56,319 --> 01:22:00,960
which would be a great idea let them

2094
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:02,238
know what substrate you're using right

2095
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,600
on those pre-rolls because a lot of

2096
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:07,198
people think a pre-roll back in the day

2097
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,639
when cannabis places or dispensaries

2098
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,678
just open they used all the BS for the

2099
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:14,039
pre-rolls you know and it was like

2100
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,039
nobody wanted to smoke that you know but

2101
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:18,079
if you

2102
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:20,000
can detail a map for them to where they

2103
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:22,158
can actually trust the source where it

2104
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,560
came from what the plant is what

2105
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:26,039
nutrients were used in it yeah I think

2106
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,440
think that's the education level on

2107
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:30,158
which people will actually really enjoy

2108
01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:31,879
well and I think if you want to know

2109
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:33,960
about my stuff I think the information

2110
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:36,159
is mostly there and even more so the

2111
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,359
stuff that we're working on like with

2112
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:41,960
grodan and and Char cor and some of

2113
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:43,719
these other brands um we do publicize it

2114
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,239
we do share with everybody what we're

2115
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:47,319
using what we're doing to create the

2116
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:49,000
genetics if we're using a tissue culture

2117
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:51,079
plant or if we're not using a tissue

2118
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,840
culture plant we stated you know in the

2119
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:55,000
future we will be doing everything with

2120
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,600
tissue culture as far as genetics M it's

2121
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,479
just going to be the standard that

2122
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:01,600
everything's clean and uh Optimal Health

2123
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:03,799
when we're breeding with it I'm Gonna

2124
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,239
Get You On Kaya too nice you got to try

2125
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:09,199
the Kaya I'm down I'm down there's

2126
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:12,198
nothing I won't try to see if it

2127
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:15,000
improves what I do correct there's a

2128
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:17,158
couple things but for the most part it's

2129
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,039
it I'm always down to try stuff and I'm

2130
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:21,479
always looking to improve and I I feel

2131
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:24,719
like you have to get rid of your ego

2132
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:26,559
when you're looking at stuff and

2133
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,679
sometimes the guys with the ego are the

2134
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,320
ones that have good products and

2135
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,719
sometimes it's the quiet guys and so

2136
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:33,319
corre I'm okay working with the big guys

2137
01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:35,880
and with the little guys but I want the

2138
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:37,799
best product I can possibly get you know

2139
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,600
and we're trying to United right now and

2140
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,960
you know we'll see how that goes and I'm

2141
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,079
excited you know I'll be able to share

2142
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,439
the results with everybody online so and

2143
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:47,519
and I'm one of those guys that if I

2144
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:49,439
don't like it I don't talk bad about it

2145
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,679
yeah because I try so much stuff I I

2146
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:53,960
don't want to be the guy that like hates

2147
01:23:50,679 --> 01:23:55,800
on a lot of products um I like a lot of

2148
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,600
products and and I think they have value

2149
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,039
and and they have value maybe not value

2150
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,800
for me right now but I could see the

2151
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,439
value for this person or this person or

2152
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:06,000
that person and so and there there's so

2153
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,799
many things to try there is it's just

2154
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,920
like everyone's environment's different

2155
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,039
yeah and and exactly everybody's room is

2156
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,079
completely not completely different but

2157
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:15,719
substantially different enough to where

2158
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:17,719
you could be right next door to somebody

2159
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:19,639
else they could have the same nutrients

2160
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:21,760
and get completely different results

2161
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:24,480
100% agreed I see that all the time

2162
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,520
actually do you yeah see I don't go into

2163
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,718
many Gardens I'm still stuck behind the

2164
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,800
desk working on the phone all day long

2165
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:34,279
you know networking sourcing taking care

2166
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,279
of the stores you know right so I'm

2167
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:39,840
still in touch with those guys all day

2168
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:42,719
every day and eventually it's G to I'm

2169
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,679
going to use those stores to then expand

2170
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,198
it to where then they're talking to

2171
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:48,760
other stores you know cuz it's Evolution

2172
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:51,919
you got to grow and get better and get

2173
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:53,400
to manufacturers so we can leverage down

2174
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,359
the price to get the price a little

2175
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:57,879
lower to keep the grower growing that's

2176
01:24:55,359 --> 01:25:00,198
what the manufacturers are missing is if

2177
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:02,560
the Growers stop growing they're out of

2178
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:03,678
business too right you know so let's

2179
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,960
help each other We're All in This

2180
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:09,079
Together We Are it's a community it's a

2181
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:12,039
team and if people can see the word team

2182
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:14,319
you know and fight for that that's the

2183
01:25:12,039 --> 01:25:16,560
objection that will make it in the long

2184
