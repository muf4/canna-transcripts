How's it going everybody? Welcome to

7
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,119
another episode of the James Lab podcast

8
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,079
and today our special guest is Lem from

9
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,679
Lampire Seeds. How you doing? Great to

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,359
have you on the show. All right. Good to

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,439
see you, man. We've been hanging out at

12
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,479
shows on and off for quite a while, you

13
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,198
know, and uh you've got a shop up north.

14
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,719
You bought some of our books. Um and

15
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,158
yeah, so thank you for that. Thank you

16
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
for the support. Thank you for the kind

17
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
words with the book. Yeah, man. The book

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
is great. I just wanted to start off

19
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,239
just blessing the energy of the cannabis

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,320
plant that we all get to share in.

21
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,759
giving thanks to the elders that have

22
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,478
basically paved the road we're all

23
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,239
walking on and uh we're carrying the

24
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,000
torch and hopefully, you know, we we can

25
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,839
keep the next generation well lit.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Absolutely. Well said. So, yeah, it's

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,960
amazing because I think a lot of people

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,320
think of breeding as something modern

29
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,478
with cannabis, but breeding has been

30
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,158
going on since the dawn of time, right?

31
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,759
Since Well, not since the dawn of time,

32
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,159
but since agriculture has been a thing

33
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,920
and since men started breeding before.

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,118
Yeah. I mean, we're talking two ice ages

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,519
millions and millions and millions of

36
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,920
years ago. Absolutely. Long time. And

37
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,759
yeah, naturally occurring. And they may

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
just be starting to show our work,

39
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,599
right? But it's been happening naturally

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,439
forever, right? And they were, you know,

41
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,679
they were breeding for resin. They were

42
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,798
breeding for plant fiber. They were

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,079
breeding for so many different things

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,840
for for millennia, right? And and right

45
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,438
now we're breeding for different things

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,439
maybe, but the breeding work has been

47
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,679
done for years. To get us to this point,

48
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,120
there was a lot of work that went on.

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
It's just like humans, you know. It's

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
just like humans from the beginning of

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,800
time. A lot of stuff happened, you know,

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,159
nature takes its own course, but yeah,

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
they're really showing the work this

54
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,919
tonight. Like now, like down to the

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,760
actual locust on the alil, like really

56
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,759
being able to break it down, especially

57
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,199
with that human genome project. Well,

58
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,878
it's interesting because if you take

59
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:33,119
something like wild mustard 2500 years

60
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:36,000
ago, basically cabbage, Brussels

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,239
sprouts, kale, kale, all those things,

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,919
kale, Yeah. broccoli, they were all wild

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,000
mustard. And because of human

64
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,799
interaction with the the plant the with

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,159
wild mustard uh we now have all these

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,599
amazing things and they were bred

67
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,079
specifically for different things like

68
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,119
land race genetics how right apples and

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,280
wine and cannabis basically. Yeah it's

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
pretty amazing as far as the path that

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,719
these things have gone on with human

72
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,958
interaction to get us to this point and

73
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,639
how we've grown alongside them as well.

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,719
It's as if you know we want to survive

75
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,799
and the plant wants to survive as well.

76
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,039
You know, one of those things like the

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,239
Ethiopian land raises with the absic

78
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,479
acid or whatever, right? You're

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,400
wondering like is this thing responding

80
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,158
to the human like humans are starving in

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
Ethiopia. Is the plant learning how to

82
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,840
like live in drought? Is it a response

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
to what's going on? Is it an interaction

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
like an electromagnetic currency that

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,759
connect or is it just surviving learning

86
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,359
how to deal with drought because

87
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,039
otherwise it won't survive? It's almost

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
as if the plant has just as much of a

89
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,959
need to survive as we do. For sure. And

90
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,958
there's adaptation that occurs with

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
cannabis and with humans that you don't

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,799
see with a lot of other plants, you

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
know. Yep. Exactly. We're both making

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
each other better. And like the like

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,319
your book was saying, you know, we're

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,120
40% similar genetically, which is

97
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,280
amazing. You think about it. I mean, we

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
could have evolved from cannabis. Yep.

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,878
That's totally possible. Mushrooms,

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,480
cannabis. I've always thought the

101
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,598
cannabis is in control. At least for me

102
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,039
in my life. People are always like,

103
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,318
"Yeah, we're in control of cannabis."

104
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,959
It's like, "No, man. The cannabis

105
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,958
chooses you." Yeah. and and like it's in

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
control. It tells you what to do. Yeah.

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
And at the end of the day, we're just

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,480
stewards. We're just moving the plant

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,120
along, you know? We're we're uh one

110
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,840
component of this plant's long life

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
cycle. And it's one of ours. It's one of

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
ours. It's a magical cosmic connection.

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,918
Like I was telling you, I was up late

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,358
and I was thinking about reading your

115
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,959
book there, the cannabis breeding book,

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,719
and I just cracked it open on the first

117
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,719
page and it opened to the Methusela

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,479
seed, the 2,000-year-old, like the

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
oldest plant, the oldest seed that got

120
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,399
to germinate. in Israel, right, where I

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
was born. And I was like, "Wow, that's

122
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,359
fascinating." I called my buddy up, Dan,

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,439
and he's like, "Oh, yeah. My cousin was

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,439
on that project. I visited that plant

125
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,360
recently." And like, "Man, this is such

126
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,478
a small world." And this is exactly what

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,319
I was thinking about. I was thinking

128
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,399
about old seeds, and it just opened to

129
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,839
that page. Yeah. It's just cosmic. It's

130
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,000
beyond cosmic. It's amazing, you know,

131
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:55,039
serendipity. And it occurs so often uh

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
not within just this industry but within

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
life, you know, as you move through

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
life. It's like there there's intention

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,079
and then there's some things that are

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,399
just meant to be, you know, cosmic

137
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,159
forces that line up and Exactly. things

138
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,319
happen. Tell me how you got started with

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,759
the plant. I had seen it growing up and

140
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,599
one day I was walking to school. I was a

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
little kid and I had I found a little

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
gold case. Somebody must have thrown it

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,079
out the window when they got pulled over

144
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,240
or something. I brought it into school

145
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,519
not knowing what it was and it was maybe

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,439
second or third grade. They made me

147
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,959
write a report on cannabis. So that was

148
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,199
like my first exposure to it. I hadn't

149
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,638
used it yet, but then I'm like 10 years

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160
old at summer camp and some of the kids

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,319
from Florida brought joints and we

152
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,000
started getting high. But it wasn't like

153
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,279
till I was 12, 13. I was having grandma

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,360
seizures and they were, you know, three

155
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,918
days horrible seizures. And I realized I

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,840
could score some weed, dime bag in the

157
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,719
hood, smoke a joint, and just not have

158
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,359
seizures. you know, really cut down,

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,280
have maybe a half a second or 10 second

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,600
seizure compared to like a 3-day seizure

161
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,319
or like a 2 and 1/2 minute grand mile or

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
just something that was damaging. So, it

163
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,839
really wasn't a question of legality or

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
morality for me. It was just like I had

165
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,239
found the way. And from that point on,

166
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,079
that was it. I was writing letters to

167
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,319
Carl from the Super Sativa Seed Lover

168
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,478
Club and getting seeds sent in the mail,

169
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,879
growing the M19. We had like a an

170
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,279
amazing triple cross of Pakistani citron

171
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,199
hashplant, Afghani hashplant and Durban

172
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,519
hashplant that I had written a letter

173
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,840
and he had sent me skunk one and then he

174
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,279
sent me skunk one again and myself as a

175
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,879
12-year-old kid I'm like hey man I

176
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,038
already have that I need something you

177
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,800
know more zah just and they're like

178
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,560
listen we're not releasing a lot of this

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,478
but I'm going to send it to you and the

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,959
cool thing is I'm back in span of in

181
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,800
2019 and I run into Carl and he's like

182
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,638
dude you're on the original mailing list

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,879
and we want to see what you've done. And

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,199
I was like, "Dude, I F-150 like like

185
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,279
we're deep into crossing that strain

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,280
five, six times a year into itself over

187
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,959
30 years." Yeah. And it's just amazing.

188
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,758
It's like the backbone to our genetics,

189
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,758
the limb. Nice. And uh it's just

190
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,199
awesome. I love seeing those old hazes

191
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
come to life, you know, and what you can

192
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,759
do just cross them and cross them and

193
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,840
cross them. You know, I went to an event

194
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,560
that we were both at, which was the

195
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,399
Turpami in December. David DS. Yeah,

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
David D. Big shout out David. Really

197
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,318
good event. I mean, I think it was well

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,840
attended. It wasn't the biggest, but it

199
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,360
was well attended by the people that

200
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,359
matter. It was great for a first year

201
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
turnout, I thought. Lots of potential,

202
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
great vibes. The talent the talent

203
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,639
there, the the talent was there. And the

204
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,360
thing is is we had guys coming out of

205
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,038
the hills with sativas, you know, like

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
true sativa structure, if we're talking

207
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,240
about morphology, that that leaning with

208
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
amazing profiles that weren't just the

209
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
standard gelatoes that everybody's

210
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,840
consuming these days. We're talking

211
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
about I mean we had farms. You got me

212
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,198
and Jean Ari. You got everybody there.

213
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,478
Everybody. I had Super Silver there. The

214
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,400
only thing missing was maybe like a

215
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,159
business forum to just kind of help

216
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,679
everybody. Like each one of us maybe has

217
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,439
an edge or a tip that we could share

218
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
with each other. Yeah. It's like Von

219
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,879
Benjamin, one of my favorite musicians

220
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,598
from Midnight says, "When together we

221
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,120
realize our actual strength and size,

222
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,120
evil will be trembling." And that's one

223
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
thing that people are missing. like we

224
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,280
don't people overlook what we have here

225
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,879
and what we've made and the potential of

226
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,359
what will happen if we just come

227
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,199
together and and not like worry about

228
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,360
the ego or yourself and it can be

229
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,038
challenging because times can get rough

230
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,199
and all of a sudden you're like whoa

231
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,038
what happened you know cannabis man you

232
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
know I have to think a little harder to

233
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,120
keep it going but that keeps you on the

234
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,479
cutting edge and uh it's one of the

235
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
challenges especially people are facing

236
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,318
in Northern California right now as the

237
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
number goes low and we're fighting

238
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
people like glass house trying

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,639
bring the number down to 100 or 200

240
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,879
bucks when raising the taxes in June.

241
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,879
The best thing you can do is tell people

242
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
no, you know, tell that person no, I'm

243
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,439
not going to sell you a box for 20

244
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,240
grand, you know? Yeah. kick rocks and

245
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,399
you know and just force yourself to to

246
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,879
get a plan. Enter the white market, set

247
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,278
your brand, build your brand, lock in

248
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,799
contracts that come back forever instead

249
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,559
of waiting for somebody to come down the

250
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,278
driveway who may or may not ever come

251
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,919
back, but that's not a building block to

252
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,439
your empire, right? You know, on top of

253
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,120
just having a pie chart, like what I

254
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
tell growers all the time is know where

255
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
your cannabis is going. know what

256
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,360
percent is going to go for whole plant

257
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,800
fresh frozen or edibles or maybe that

258
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,879
your smalls are going to go towards

259
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,159
joints or pre-rolls or an edible

260
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,320
product. Know what you're doing before

261
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,120
you get after it. Contract your stuff

262
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,640
and have it sold and uh that'll help you

263
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,879
get ahead of it instead of trying to

264
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,639
grow a,000 or 2,000 lbs or get to the

265
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,679
point where you've grown more than you

266
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,600
thought you were going to, which is

267
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,278
everybody's goal, but then processing

268
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,639
it. You know, like if you're trying to

269
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,639
sell your cannabis in eights, no,

270
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,879
there's 128s in a pound. And if you're

271
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,919
going to grow 1,000 or 2,000 lbs, you're

272
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,159
probably not going to be able to sell it

273
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,000
all in eighs in a year. So make an

274
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,600
edible product, which has been, you

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
know,

276
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
at least convert it into concentrate so

277
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,159
it doesn't go bad. Exactly. Cuz I mean,

278
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
I see that happening a lot where people

279
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,360
are like, "Oh yeah, I got last year's

280
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
outdoor." And it's like, dude, like

281
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,360
we're a year and a half, right? If

282
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,799
you're not cryogen or freezing that, and

283
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,320
who's got room to do that with a,000

284
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,799
pounds? But you can take it and turn it

285
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,959
into a rosin. You can turn it into any

286
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,879
form of hash and you can preserve it for

287
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,039
an extended amount of time. Even civ or

288
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,639
dry civ right now static. People are

289
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,480
getting really into that. Oh, I love

290
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,639
static. I love static. I love all those

291
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,320
forms of hash. And I think they all have

292
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,639
so much potential, but also the shelf

293
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,720
life lasts a lot longer. A lot of them

294
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,319
get better with age. Well, all the hash

295
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
we were smoking, let's say, 20, 30 years

296
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
ago, right? I'm 50. So, you'd score some

297
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
hash and not realizing because we didn't

298
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,679
know about CBN's as much, right? This

299
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,839
hash is probably 2, three years old.

300
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,239
it's been smuggled from like Afghanistan

301
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,640
or like Morocco or even longer. So, we

302
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,639
were getting ruined on that stuff, you

303
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,078
know? So, a lot of this fresh rosin and

304
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,078
like when I smoke it, I'm not a big

305
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,078
rosin smoker, but it just wakes me up.

306
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,838
It's the opposite cuz it's so fresh. The

307
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,679
whole plant fresh frozen glands are just

308
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
they almost have a chi to them. Yeah.

309
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,399
They just have like a high like a wiry

310
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,839
energy when I smoke them. Totally. And

311
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,200
people can continuously smoke it. You

312
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,720
could never smoke like a half ounce of

313
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,720
hash. It would just put you to sleep.

314
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
It' be like no like hash oil or butter.

315
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
Half ounce of hash is equivalent to x

316
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,039
amount of depending on the strength. But

317
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,639
that's that's a lot of flour. It is. And

318
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,319
you got to remember too like you know

319
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,399
Bob Marley like all these people that

320
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,000
were smoking they were smoking cannabis

321
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,679
o five or 10% and getting really high.

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,958
You know you remember being a kid in

323
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,799
high school scoring dime bags and

324
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,319
smoking weed and just laughing your ass

325
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,159
off. You know if you would have put that

326
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,879
weed to the lab it probably wouldn't hit

327
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,319
15 20%. But it was great cannabis. Yeah.

328
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,399
And that's something that people miss is

329
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,040
that the turpps decide they help your

330
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,480
brain accept and decide how much THC

331
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,919
you're going to get.

332
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,920
And it's just dangerous chasing the

333
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,078
percentards or or you know in the white

334
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,399
market especially it's so prevalent that

335
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,838
you see people we see two 300 people a

336
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,120
day and most of them just ask us how

337
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
they can get the most for their money

338
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,240
and their value in their mind is like

339
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,078
over 30% THC. It's just what they've

340
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
been taught. They just don't understand.

341
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,000
and they come in like, "How much THC can

342
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,240
I get for 40 bucks?" As if like the

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,559
higher the number is more medicine.

344
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Yeah. But would you go buy 151 and drink

345
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,239
that? You know what I mean? Like it's it

346
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
that's a great comparison. And education

347
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
is lacking. And once you teach people,

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,759
they they know, but it's there's a gap.

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,039
You know, not everybody's in the bubble

350
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,720
or a chrono or like a lifetime cannabis

351
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,240
enthusiast, right? So, a lot of the

352
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
older folks, they're not going to want

353
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
to smoke. They're coming in and no one

354
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,039
wants to start smoking when they're 60

355
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
or 70. They probably just want most of

356
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,559
them just want to get to bed, you know.

357
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,719
That's why you're seeing edibles in my

358
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,319
mind being so prevalent. Yeah. And I

359
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
love edibles, you know, and I love the

360
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,959
direction edibles have gone in with the

361
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,559
rosin gummies. I love rosin gummies. I

362
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,879
love these companies that are actually

363
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:32,078
just using the flavor from the actual

364
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,759
flour to the flour. All the integrity is

365
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,199
kept because like that's the problem,

366
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,480
man. Once they start using distillate

367
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,639
and a lot of these companies once they

368
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,639
just start having to meet a financial

369
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,000
model they end up using distillate and

370
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,440
they have their brand but it's not the

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,278
same integrity anymore and that's a

372
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,320
shame as you see like these giant farms

373
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:51,600
take over. Integrity farms brother. Yep.

374
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,200
Absolutely. And I think integrity is

375
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,639
just so important in the industry and

376
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
you're only as good as your last batch

377
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,440
to a degree you know. So shout out to

378
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,959
Michael Omaha man great elder who always

379
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
told us man the three most important

380
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,439
things are integrity integrity.

381
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,759
integrity. Absolutely. Literally, man.

382
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,519
You cannot go wrong. I tell people all

383
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,838
the time, kill them with kind blood. You

384
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,679
know, just be nice, right? You know,

385
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
like we're we're in Yukaya and we've

386
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,879
been there since ' 09. We're the first

387
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,039
dispensary and and nowadays there's, you

388
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,799
know, 10 15 more spots within a square

389
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,559
mile. Yeah. And I don't worry about it

390
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,240
even though it is worrisome. You see

391
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,439
cookies up there and they're for sale

392
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,039
and there's just so many spots. And what

393
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,560
I tell people and I welcome them every

394
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,480
time they come is just be nice, you

395
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,518
know? Just be nice, right? Right? Be

396
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,879
nice to your people and they'll come

397
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,959
back. It doesn't matter what kind of

398
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,159
competition you have cuz pretty soon

399
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,439
it's going to be like that everywhere.

400
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,120
Everyone's going to feel that. It's not

401
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
a thing to be afraid of because it's

402
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,799
America. Yeah. You can't just tell

403
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,078
someone not to open, right? Totally. So

404
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,439
New York's going to feel that.

405
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,879
Everyone's going to feel it. And it's

406
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,279
nothing to fear as long as you have

407
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,720
integrity. Absolutely.

408
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,159
You know, I'm getting excited for

409
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,839
interstate commerce. I don't know how

410
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,000
far away we're from from having

411
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,199
interstate commerce, but I would love I

412
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,879
feel like we're close. You're seeing

413
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,559
Snoop and a lot of these people really

414
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,799
start stepping it up and you're seeing

415
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,719
like the THCA. They're they're building

416
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,719
like the train tracks for the railroad

417
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,120
to run on. I feel like and they're

418
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,639
close. Um they have to have some kind of

419
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
interior knowledge having invested in

420
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,320
the European medical market and

421
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,040
somebody's telling them what to do and

422
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
helping them guide their decisions. So I

423
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,240
feel like they have at least a little

424
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,360
bit of an edge. Anything's positive in

425
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
the right direction. Honestly, we've

426
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
waited so long. If you think about

427
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,479
California, we we've been doing this

428
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,799
since 96. And so if they were to let us

429
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,959
have interstate commerce, that would be

430
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,198
amazing. You know, if somebody bought

431
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,119
the USPS, which is going bankrupt, and

432
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,799
let us use it to ship, that would be

433
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,639
great. Yeah. If we had a cannabis bank,

434
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,319
if somebody put 15 mil into a federal

435
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,839
credit union for cannabis, it would be

436
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,600
amazing.

437
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,440
Totally. And these are the things that

438
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,278
force like farmers the permitting and

439
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
all the rules force us to take another

440
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,320
look at our labor. Like how can we

441
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
reduce labor? One of the biggest ways to

442
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
do it and what's happening is whole

443
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,159
plant fresh frozen because you don't

444
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,519
have to harvest your cannabis in the

445
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,439
same way. You don't have to spend time

446
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,679
curing it, drying it, trimming it,

447
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
paying a trim crew. You just freeze it,

448
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,159
done, right? We have a manufacturing

449
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,399
facility at our dispensary in Ukaya. And

450
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,600
we can process a farm in a couple days,

451
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,919
just be done. And then you have a

452
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,600
product that's the the quantity is

453
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
reduced. It's much smaller. It's higher

454
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,959
grade. It'll keep for longer. You can

455
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
decide if you want to put it into an

456
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,278
edible or just sell it as hash, right?

457
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,039
Or turn it into rosin. What are your

458
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,480
thoughts on trimming machines? I don't

459
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,759
like trimming machines personally. It's

460
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,959
funny. I just had a friend of mine

461
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,639
complaining today about how all the

462
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,719
dispensary herb or a lot of that he was

463
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,480
buying is trimmed. And you know, we

464
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,759
we've used them. Sometimes you grow so

465
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
many thousands of pounds that you just

466
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,360
have to use them or your weed will like

467
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,959
rot before you have it trimmed. And it

468
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,320
makes it like the comparison to me is it

469
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,479
makes it look like your weed is like a

470
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,278
year old outdoor. Like you can take a

471
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,879
piece of fresh greenhouse that just

472
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,480
looks better than any indoor. It's just

473
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,639
glistening in the sun with so many

474
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,720
trikes and compare it to something that

475
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,639
you tumbled on a machine and it just

476
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
doesn't even compare. Plus, you have to

477
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,759
pick the right strain. Like you want a

478
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,879
strain that's kind of chunky. You don't

479
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
want a strain that has like a lot of

480
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,879
smaller buds or it has a lot of shape to

481
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,839
it. It just depends on the trim machine,

482
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,600
too. Cuz I hated trim machines up until

483
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,440
last month and then I saw the resonator

484
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
work. No, they're amazing. I've been

485
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,959
building them since I was a little kid.

486
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,120
like beef tumblers and machines. Yeah.

487
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,359
Well, this liquid CO2 with the resonator

488
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,440
where it has the the net like the the

489
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
thing's amazing. It's amazing for what

490
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,759
it is, right? And the yield it goes way

491
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,919
up. You're talking like 20 to 40% versus

492
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000
like chasing 5 to 10% on whole plane

493
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,039
fresh frozen. Yeah. And now 10 to 15

494
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,120
when you're just say like you're

495
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,078
freezing your trim and running it $20 to

496
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
trim a pound, right? $25, $15 depending

497
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,919
on way less even. We would have trim

498
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,278
crews like there's still you still need

499
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,278
people to operate those machines, right?

500
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,720
You need an operator and someone to like

501
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,078
a clipboard. Oh, no. I'm talking

502
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
specifically the resonator because you

503
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,479
do use the liquid CO2 and so there's the

504
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,278
cost of that plus and and but I really

505
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
like TJ and the kind of stuff he's

506
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,039
doing. I think it's actually pretty

507
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
impressive. Yeah, it's awesome to see

508
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,919
people just moving forward and not, you

509
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
know, staying on the cutting edge, but

510
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,159
also just making things better. Yeah, I

511
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,678
like it when people try to be creative

512
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
and they're able to do stuff that

513
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,759
benefits the industry, right? And so

514
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,519
I've also learned not to say, "Fuck,

515
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,038
that sucks." You know, because maybe

516
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,798
this version does suck, but down the

517
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,240
road it's not going to be that blural

518
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,199
LED light anymore. Now we're going to

519
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,880
have a LED that's amazing. Yep. Exactly.

520
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
Or feminiz seeds. Everyone hated

521
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,600
feminized seeds when we were younger. I

522
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,480
mean hated hated

523
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,159
especially people had negative

524
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,079
experiences or something, you know, like

525
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,759
sure they either came across a herm or

526
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,639
they weren't educated enough about it.

527
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,240
Um we don't run feminized seeds yet, but

528
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,280
something I'd be into I'd be into doing

529
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,519
a collab or getting that 4Z feminized.

530
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,839
um just because many people want it and

531
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,279
even just selling seeds and breeding.

532
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,759
People have been asking me for feminiz

533
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:50,480
seeds forever. I mean the last 20 years

534
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,798
especially. Well, if you start with

535
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
stable genetics and you make feminiz

536
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,480
seeds from stable genetics, it's a trait

537
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,240
that can be bred in or bred out, right?

538
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,919
You can breed it into regular seeds just

539
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,359
as easy as you can with feminiz seeds.

540
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,038
Certain strains have a harder time doing

541
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,719
it, but it doesn't mean that you should

542
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,879
run from the challenge. You just upreed

543
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
it and go for it again, right? Yeah.

544
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
There definitely is a demand and you

545
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,480
have to listen to demand. That's a

546
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
really important thing in the industry.

547
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,279
If you have people asking you for

548
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,720
something, you have to listen. Whether

549
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,480
you have a dispensary and people want a

550
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,558
certain product, you may not like that

551
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,679
product. People may be like, "Ah, why do

552
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,759
you have cheaters or why are you

553
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,919
carrying steey or but if you have

554
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,599
customers asking you for it, you have to

555
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,960
run it, you know?" Absolutely. I

556
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,798
remember starting and we we had only

557
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,240
organic products and we had like 50 jars

558
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,679
of flour and people would come in. We

559
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
had four gram ace and you could pick it

560
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,919
out of the jar yourself. People were in

561
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,960
heaven, you know. And then slowly like

562
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,360
rosin and pens started coming in and all

563
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,558
these regulations and you really see

564
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,759
like a lot less quality herb honestly as

565
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,240
it's commercialized. They're still

566
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,000
around. You can get grape flour. Well,

567
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,599
we can get grape flour, but I think the

568
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,679
average person get grape flour. If they

569
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,599
know where to look, they can. It's hard

570
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,720
too if you're the average person. Yeah.

571
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,759
And you're going to a dispensary,

572
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,360
whatever state you're in, you're trying

573
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,879
to figure out which medicine is good for

574
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,479
you and you try all the different ones,

575
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,080
which isn't cheap, and you finally find

576
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,440
one you like. I hear this story a lot.

577
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,480
and then they're out of it and then you

578
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,480
got to try the whole gambit again. Yeah.

579
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,400
And you know people want the same thing

580
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,640
every time. They want the same response.

581
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
So it's hard for them to chase it. Like

582
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
we haven't smoke in 40 years, right? And

583
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
so you know what you like. You know what

584
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
you liked when you were a kid. You know

585
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,359
when you see it again. It's almost like

586
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,960
you have a photographic memory. I do

587
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,959
anyway for any strain I've ever seen

588
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,519
since the beginning of my life with

589
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,000
cannabis. I I like register it. I know

590
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,400
what it smelled like. Yeah. even like

591
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,319
wet moldy batches of crypto that came in

592
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,320
from Florida and mail order in the 80s

593
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,720
or I'll remember that even you know but

594
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,480
I definitely remember the good ones you

595
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,440
know that one that just you're in the

596
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
deadlock and you score some Afghany or

597
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,519
even before all these strains like in

598
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,840
the 80s you could get some tie stick or

599
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,720
Colombian or just you know just tie that

600
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,798
was just amazing man mindblowing you

601
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,240
know one hit and you're just done yeah

602
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:59,359
it's funny cuz I remember all the

603
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
different genetics and we didn't even

604
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,479
have names on stuff it wasn't

605
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,240
necessarily I named it a lot of times a

606
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,038
good green or kind. Yeah, we had kind

607
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,519
bud, green bud, sexy, maxi or pretend to

608
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,038
go. We had Mexican brown weed. Yeah, we

609
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,960
had the brown a lot of brown weed that

610
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,720
was seated. Definitely, you know, and

611
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,919
even even some of that stuff was

612
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,798
actually really good though. There was

613
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,160
like the the more the higherend Mexican

614
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,240
that was actually really it was still

615
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,120
pressed. It still had seeds in it. Yeah.

616
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,880
Like Ces or Bus Head or many names. We'd

617
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,038
get blocks of it in the hood, man, from

618
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,200
the Jamaicans growing up back east. That

619
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,480
was basically our staple. But the bad

620
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,798
stuff would give you a headache. You'd

621
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,480
have the worst headache afterwards. Yep.

622
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,079
Or give you cramps or like you could

623
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,240
tell something had been sprayed or

624
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,399
something was wrong. Pesticides. But

625
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,240
man, I smoked so many good dime bags out

626
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
of the hood that just made me laugh for

627
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,720
hours. It give you just giggle juice.

628
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,080
You know, it'd be creeper. You you feel

629
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,679
like nothing was going on and then all

630
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,439
of a sudden you're just permagrin and

631
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,400
just laughing your ass off for hours.

632
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,080
And totally I rarely see that cuz it's

633
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
not the shiniest. It's more like an old

634
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,678
school sativa that you know people

635
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,599
aren't really wanting to grow indoors or

636
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,200
outdoors. Yeah. But when you get it,

637
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,599
it's awesome. Just the creeper, you

638
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,679
know, that that effect. People want such

639
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,759
an instant gratification high now. They

640
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,919
want to exhale and just feel the weight

641
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,359
of the world going off their shoulders,

642
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,720
you know, and you can get that. But

643
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,959
there's something about good creeper

644
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,798
weed that kicks in after 15 minutes, you

645
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,798
know. I I still I got some of that last

646
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:26,079
year from Johnny from Huckleberry Hill

647
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,759
Farms and that stuff literally it was a

648
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,599
batch of his mother's weed and it

649
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,839
literally I took a bong and it didn't do

650
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,599
anything. So I took another one and I

651
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,359
think I took a couple more and like

652
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,918
literally 15 minutes later I was on the

653
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,759
couch and I'm like man freaking eyes got

654
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,320
tight and it was one of those slow

655
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,919
creepers. Not like okay after I took a

656
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,279
couple bong hits I feel good. It was

657
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,799
like man that [ __ ] didn't do anything

658
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,480
and then literally 5 minutes I'm like oh

659
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,639
I feel a little bit high. 10 minutes

660
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
later, I'm like, I feel great. And then

661
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
15 minutes later, I was like, wow. Like

662
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,640
borderline too high. Yeah, I like that

663
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,000
kind of effect, man. I love cannabis in

664
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,640
general, man. I mean, I like any kind of

665
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
land race or as long as it's organically

666
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,440
grown. I mean, I have a hard time even

667
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,200
judging some of these events where they

668
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,480
throw 40 different kinds of hydroponic

669
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,000
cannabis like in Europe or Michigan. I

670
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,599
mean, anywhere where you're judging

671
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,640
sometimes, you know, you really start

672
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,240
paying attention because you're like,

673
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,440
man, I smoke organic weed everywhere I

674
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,079
go. Right. What are your thoughts on

675
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,519
Bilero? You try the pearls. Oh, I love

676
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,960
the pearls. They're upbeat. They're

677
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,558
really nice. Yeah, I like what he's

678
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,319
doing. I like like a rare stuff. I was

679
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,519
trying to help him market that. It's

680
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,599
just hard. Like I said, it's hard to

681
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,079
educate people and get people in the

682
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,439
consumer point to respect tiny little

683
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,599
pebbles like that. It's like Dr.

684
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,519
Greenspoon. But I love that stuff. Like

685
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,839
I'm a hyper guy and I that stuff makes

686
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,599
me more hyper and I still love smoking

687
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,359
it. You know, every time I see that dude

688
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,959
I'm like what can I do to get a little

689
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,279
bit of those just little pebbles, you

690
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,640
know? I love those. Yeah. His Bubba Kush

691
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,079
is really good, too. He's got a couple

692
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,440
good Bubba Kush crosses. They're

693
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,960
amazing. I liked what he said on the

694
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,320
show about, and I agree with him about

695
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,079
how it's just a beautiful thing to just

696
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,000
give someone cannabis. You know, many

697
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,399
times I've given someone my last nug,

698
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,440
and I'm talking like really nice indoor

699
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,159
organic head stash from seed grown in

700
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,919
only water with no chems or nudes, like

701
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,600
just really head stash. And it's just,

702
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,880
you know, I always knew another bud

703
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,399
would come my way, but there's something

704
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,559
to be said about just giving someone a

705
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,320
nug, you know, especially when it's like

706
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,240
the best nug they're ever going to get

707
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,839
and a nug that you respect and you just

708
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,480
kick it down and that's like a beautiful

709
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,918
thing, right? Yeah. He's local. I like

710
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,599
what he's done with the sour. His sour

711
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,679
was dead on. Everyone's kind of chasing

712
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,798
the sour. It's so good. I I have some in

713
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,880
the drawer right here. The thing with

714
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,158
the sour is like that. Not not that he's

715
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,840
fighting it, but you know, the nose is

716
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,000
slowly fading from the sour you saw in

717
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,879
like the late 90s, early 2000s. It's the

718
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
same like popcorny lime green with the

719
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
pinkish hairs. It's what everybody's

720
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,320
wanting. But the nose is slowly

721
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,038
delineating. The first person I've had

722
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,639
express it correctly in a long time.

723
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,240
Right. Definitely. Whereas actually the

724
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,520
actual expression I'm looking for and it

725
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,279
might not be genetically different than

726
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,119
a lot of the other ones, but because

727
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,279
they're going I think it's different. I

728
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,279
just think like they might be drifting a

729
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,480
little on the nose. There might be, but

730
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,000
I feel like his is dead on. Right. So

731
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,200
his like his is the one. When I smoke

732
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,519
it, I get the same effect that I'm

733
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,120
looking for. Same smell, same smell. The

734
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,319
nostalgia is just there, you know. I

735
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,839
mean, it makes me smile even just

736
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,278
thinking about it now. Yep. Me, too.

737
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,519
It's like, it's like the sour. Yeah. And

738
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,839
that was, you know, it was so big when

739
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,679
it was big. People don't even understand

740
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,918
that if you weren't there, it's hard

741
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
from New York City diesel to sour. And

742
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,799
we have the original New York City

743
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
diesel cut. We crossed with it and it

744
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,558
has that loud sour nose, you know, but

745
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,559
it's, you know, the sour is the sour.

746
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,558
Nothing, you know, that's a cut. So you

747
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:33,839
can chase it all you want, but you're

748
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,119
always going to get something that's a

749
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,158
little bit different. Well, so you know

750
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,678
what's funny is with cookies, uh we

751
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,000
haven't seen good cookies for a long

752
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,919
time. And so I've been getting asked by

753
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,440
people and so we phen hunted some from

754
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,200
seed, the best ones, my friend. No, it

755
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
was uh Loud Scout. It was platinum

756
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,759
platinum cookies. Platinum, which is

757
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,319
loud. It Loud Scout. Platinum cookies.

758
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,798
Same thing, right? And frigin. We got a

759
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,359
dead ringer for the original original

760
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,639
cookies. Like dead ringer. Like you

761
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,158
smell it, you're like, man, this smells

762
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,600
like 2012. It doesn't smell like the

763
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,960
cookies you see today. Because I feel

764
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,278
like they're all either watered down

765
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,798
versions, crosses. When people try to

766
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,798
breed it up because of the low yield,

767
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,480
but there was this strain in Yukaya in

768
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,480
the 70s and ' 80s called the Brand Y

769
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,558
Kush. And people swore that that was

770
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,079
like sometimes called the black mamba,

771
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,678
but many people said that was like the

772
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,439
backbone to the cherry pie that went

773
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,880
into some of the cookies. It was those

774
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
small little pounds that looked like a

775
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,960
football that after you grow it, you're

776
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,558
like, "Oh man, these are hard to sell or

777
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
I don't want to grow these again." Some

778
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,000
of that cherry pie, too, some of the

779
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,879
lower branches would seed or like it was

780
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,400
a difficult strain. Sure. But so tasty.

781
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,720
Just mind-blowing. Like a pound of

782
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
cherry pie. Yeah. People you could smoke

783
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,880
the whole thing to your dome. It's just

784
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,639
delicious. Yeah. Um Yeah. I haven't seen

785
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,400
a lot of the cookies in the beginning

786
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,159
when the form cut was raging. You'd grow

787
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,600
it and it was it was weird. It was an

788
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,679
odd phenomenon. You'd get bigger yields

789
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,759
off a 600 watt than you would off a,000.

790
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,600
If you backed the sun off of it outside

791
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,158
in the shade, you'd get 5 lbs versus

792
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,839
like 2 or 3 lb in full sun. It would

793
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,480
have these massive leaves the size of

794
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,038
your torso and it'd be kicking out tiny

795
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,839
little popcorn nugs, you know? Remind me

796
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,440
of like an old schooling G13 or just

797
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,359
some old school hash plant that grows

798
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,000
like a foot of stem and then gives you a

799
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,158
half gram nug, but it's just hands down

800
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,919
the best smoke, you know? But I think

801
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,159
the cookies faded out just partly

802
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,278
because it's so low yield. And when you

803
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,278
when you're growing it, like when I'm

804
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,960
growing it next to some of my stuff, you

805
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,720
just want to break it off and throw it

806
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,480
away. It's just too finicky. Yeah. And

807
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,000
it doesn't yield, you know. Well, and

808
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,679
that's why we bred with it, right, was

809
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,079
to improve the yield because the yield

810
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,759
was so bad, you know. And then we I

811
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,599
often do that. I use my lamb because

812
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,158
it's so bright and so big. I can take

813
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,839
anything from anybody's catalog and just

814
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,360
they have a dead-on genetic that I like,

815
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,079
but I just want to boost the yield a

816
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,240
little bit. Yeah. It's amazing people

817
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,759
back cross then too or you just I always

818
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,359
do that like I have that original male

819
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,240
that I made the dirty skittle with just

820
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,000
because that lem is just the backbone

821
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,400
man that that's what made the sk the

822
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,880
dirty skittle is like 37% THC you know

823
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,640
that's a big jump on an F1. Yeah. And

824
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,480
then just every time I cross it back

825
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,000
like when we made the 4Zs it's just

826
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,880
still right there. The four Z's is

827
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,640
really good. You gave me some flour at

828
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,720
Turpami. You gave me a sativa too. That

829
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,400
was a heart raiser. That was that was a

830
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,400
heart race. Like that's those killer

831
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,400
hazes. Yeah, that was that's like when I

832
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,919
think of original haze. That's the only

833
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,840
haze I've seen in years that smells like

834
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
a skunk. A lot of the hazes have that

835
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,119
African land race or like a Duran or

836
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,359
Jack or a fruity, you know, nose to it.

837
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,678
But that that that haze just put me

838
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,319
down, man. Yeah. Big up to J Trees on

839
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,919
that one cuz uh yeah, that's just

840
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,558
perfect cannabis. Well, and you don't

841
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,000
see hazes like that often. And then we

842
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,918
were in an event where there was 50

843
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,679
different bags of and you're smoking all

844
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,600
that weed and that still we couldn't

845
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,278
finish the joint, right? Even Arian was

846
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,678
like, "Whoa." And that's what I was

847
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,519
like, "Yeah, honestly, Arian was blown

848
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,120
away by the amount of haze, you know,

849
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,720
coming from Europe where Hayes is

850
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,798
European. People think of Hazes being

851
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,480
European even though it's Californian,

852
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,918
but he knows what he's doing." And he

853
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
was right. You know what I'm saying? For

854
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,159
years, let's say the last five years,

855
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,240
even I've been like me just because the

856
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,159
downfall of Jack and Durban, people

857
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,599
weren't into it, right? But having a

858
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,880
dispensary and paying attention to the

859
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,480
market in the last year or two, people

860
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,799
love it. It's at the top of the order

861
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,079
list. People love a fruity sativa that

862
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,398
they can relate to like old factorywise,

863
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,480
not just like looking at it, right? You

864
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,278
open the jar, it does something to you.

865
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,360
It's aroma therapy. It's more than just

866
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,798
loud, right? Yeah. And there's a time

867
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,119
and a place for everything. Like it's

868
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,679
good sativa. You I like strong. I like

869
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,000
candy gas. I like it all. History

870
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,360
repeats itself, too. So those oldie but

871
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,798
goodies are never going to go out of

872
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,719
style. Those ain't never going away. I

873
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,319
guarantee you that. Same thing with

874
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,319
these hazes. They will never go away.

875
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,639
They're going to keep coming back. You

876
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,278
know, I think cat piss is one where I

877
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,720
hope it comes back. Everybody wants that

878
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:56,960
skunky cat pissy. Just that odor where

879
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,519
like something sprayed you. Yeah. I want

880
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,519
that nose burning skunky ammonia, right?

881
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,519
That's what this lamoj is like mint

882
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,359
Windex and that's kind of nice. But

883
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,240
yeah, we're still just chasing the like

884
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,079
I got sprayed by a skunk, you know, like

885
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,399
we got some old seeds to open recently,

886
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:16,000
some 87 new old stock using this that

887
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:18,879
C-section, the seed section technique

888
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,480
where what happens with an older seed is

889
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
there's something, you know, there's,

890
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,360
you know, the outer shell and there's a

891
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,678
kodaliden, but there's what I call it,

892
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,678
it's almost like a subfascia. And what

893
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
it does is it recedes over time and it

894
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,000
makes it so that kodaliden can't open.

895
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,839
So if you if you have old seeds and you

896
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,960
you smush them after they don't open for

897
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,079
a little bit and you see that there was

898
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,000
nothing wrong with them inside, you're

899
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,678
wondering why it wouldn't crack. And I'm

900
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,398
talking about after scarification and

901
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,919
gillic acid. So what you can do is you

902
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,639
can actually cut the seed open with a

903
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,038
razor blade. And you'll see that the

904
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,600
kodaliden is held shut by almost like an

905
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,599
acorn which was that subfasia and it has

906
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,599
receded to a little point and hardened

907
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,918
and made it so those old seeds can't

908
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,599
open. So if you cut those with a razor

909
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,960
blade and you'll be missing a little bit

910
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,558
off those first two coat of lightens

911
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,480
when they finally come up, but they'll

912
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,398
come up even with like a 40 or 50 year

913
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
old seed. I've done this really and you

914
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,918
just keep it wet and all of a sudden you

915
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,440
know they're good because you put them

916
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,120
into a cup and they sink, right? So

917
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,399
they're not floaters. No matter what age

918
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,319
they are, you're like, "Okay, this is

919
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,398
like this can work." There's potential.

920
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,879
Yeah, there's potential. So what I found

921
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,719
is with really old seeds is they'll turn

922
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,399
like to male or like the males have a

923
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,319
better survival rate. Something about

924
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,959
the males are a little bit stronger with

925
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,960
age. And I don't know if it's time or

926
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,480
heat or something that makes more males

927
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,399
of the older seeds, but I know that with

928
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,480
this seed section tech, I can get

929
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,000
anything to open and it opens up and

930
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
those first two leaves are missing what

931
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,919
I cut out of it. And then we're going to

932
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,159
put this to the test. Oh yeah, man. I

933
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,520
got some seeds to send you that we've

934
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,440
struggled, you know, and I just got

935
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,319
these ones to open from 87. That's

936
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,840
great. So yeah, I mean we use G3, we do

937
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,038
scarification, we do all that stuff.

938
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,558
Yep. But yeah, hormones and uh and then

939
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,398
try to do them in vitro, right? In

940
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,918
tissue culture. But yeah, I mean I'm

941
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,599
always interested in trying new tech.

942
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,159
You use like hydrogen peroxide or what

943
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,558
kind of water? I do hydrogen. Yeah, we

944
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,880
clean our So we do a six to one with

945
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,879
water and hydrogen peroxide. Yep. So

946
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,840
yeah, and we soak it in that sterilizes

947
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,120
the outside seed. Uh you know, and

948
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,798
everyone has their own way of doing

949
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,000
that's in my book, too. That's a cool

950
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,960
one of the coolest part in there is, you

951
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
know, I mean, you're reading it and

952
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,840
you're seeing they got besides the

953
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,240
genome project, but you're seeing they

954
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,158
got a 2,000-y old seed to come back.

955
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,200
Now, that's just amazing. So, that means

956
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,960
like we can find we can get Civil War

957
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,759
era seeds or seeds that are in medical

958
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,840
kits that are dug up, you know, to pop

959
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,798
now. And that's just amazing. Yeah. It's

960
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:43,199
like they they found that frozen lady in

961
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,440
a log like in Russia with some super old

962
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,960
jar of nugs. And I just think that it

963
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,320
all goes back a lot farther than anybody

964
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,840
thinks. I think we've been here a lot

965
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,960
longer than people think. I think Herb's

966
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,359
been here a lot longer than people

967
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,840
think. It's just we use like these

968
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,079
certain finds to base the whole creation

969
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:01,119
theory on, right? Like Richard Leaky or

970
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,439
Homohabilis or But let's say it's a lot

971
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,678
older than that. Like let's say maybe

972
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,360
during one of the ice ages, you know, we

973
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,038
didn't get totally like wiped out. Maybe

974
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,639
a couple people survived or maybe

975
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,079
there's just it goes back a lot older

976
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,600
than we thought. Yeah. Just like

977
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,759
cannabis, I feel like people have been

978
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,480
cultivating it for a lot longer than we

979
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:22,079
think. for sure. You know, there it it

980
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,519
does grow wild everywhere, but it it

981
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,119
very well could be that people planted

982
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,038
those fields. Well, and it has the

983
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,319
ability to adapt to an environment,

984
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,119
right? Pretty much every environment.

985
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,240
Cannabis can adapt just like we can

986
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,759
adapt. It's a pretty amazing and it's

987
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,359
here to stay. Like you take it back

988
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,798
before the Bible, biblical times,

989
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,798
whatever. You take it back to the root

990
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,798
to the dinosaurs and it's here. Yeah.

991
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,639
You know, you're reading there's goats,

992
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,240
there's herb, there's humans. So, it's

993
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,080
like part of the story here. Well, and

994
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,120
it has a survival mechanism where the

995
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,199
plant will produce a seed for offspring.

996
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,959
Even the stable genetics, you can take a

997
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,720
a plant if you let them go long enough.

998
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,640
Exactly. It'll produce a seed, right? As

999
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,079
a survival mechanism. Yeah. So, this

1000
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,240
plant is going to probably be here long

1001
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,000
after we're gone. And, you know, very

1002
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,278
possible. Something on that note, being

1003
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,038
from the east coast, we've always just

1004
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,558
been chasing fast seeds. So, I'm looking

1005
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,240
for the codal and roots under a

1006
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,720
microscope like and some of the strains

1007
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,159
we've had are like 30 days. So, there's

1008
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,319
two benefits of that. like you have a

1009
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,559
super fast strain, but in nature, why is

1010
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,038
that happening? Because that strain will

1011
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,200
be done in 30 days and by 45 or 50 days,

1012
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,119
it'll be pollinating so that it can

1013
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,880
continue and like seed the rest of the

1014
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,038
crop. So that's why it was like that's

1015
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,960
the purpose of it. But when you get it

1016
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,359
and breed it, that's what we started

1017
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,640
like we have that four Z's is 40 to 45

1018
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,240
days. And people have a hard time

1019
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,960
believing it's not an autoflower, has

1020
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,319
high THC, but I tell people be ready,

1021
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,840
man. Because if you have a new cycle, I

1022
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,000
mean, that thing just gets huge

1023
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,158
instantly and deals with heat, it deals

1024
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
with cold. Like, we've not only bred it

1025
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,039
for bug resistance and temperature out

1026
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,798
in potter where it's 130° all summer

1027
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,879
long. And then in the winter where it's

1028
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,038
like 20, 30°, so you have just

1029
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,840
unbelievable temperature change, right?

1030
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,599
And you can tell like the year the

1031
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,439
Russitmites ravaged us, there was plants

1032
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,038
that just didn't get touched at all. So

1033
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,240
you look for that and even though you

1034
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,960
haven't done the work and you can't

1035
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,398
prove it on the, you know, genetically

1036
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,079
what the work you've done, you know, you

1037
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,440
have a strain that is bugp proof. You

1038
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,720
know, it's like a citroronella candle

1039
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,480
out there. Everything's getting eaten

1040
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,078
alive and this thing's just thriving.

1041
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,320
Yeah. So I tell people, not only pay

1042
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,000
attention to your climate and like where

1043
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,280
you're going to grow it, but pay

1044
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
attention to the plant that's saying,

1045
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,760
"Hey, man, I'm taking care of myself or

1046
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,838
I'm doing good." You know, if

1047
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,839
something's thriving in your climate,

1048
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,759
don't try to force it. Don't try to grow

1049
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,159
like pers or something that takes

1050
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,599
forever in a zone where you have to have

1051
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,398
a quick crop. Like if you're on the

1052
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,919
coast, bust a quicker crop. Yeah. You

1053
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,319
know, with four Z's, we're getting, you

1054
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,239
know, five to six rounds where people

1055
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,760
get two or three. You learn real quick

1056
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,239
because that is one of the best places

1057
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,399
for stress testing for the tritis,

1058
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,838
powdery milk. Oh, man. Those things, you

1059
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,918
know, I got to give it up to the farmers

1060
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,759
that are coastal, you know, and and

1061
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,598
there's so many advantages to breeding

1062
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,119
coastal and genetic testing coastal.

1063
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,800
like as far as if you're testing your

1064
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,240
and paying attention to where you are,

1065
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,599
you know, like you could be coastal,

1066
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,439
you're not going to be able to grow most

1067
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,480
OGs. You can want it all you want, you

1068
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,200
know, and you're also not going to want

1069
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,960
a late flowering harvest because unless

1070
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,118
it's bulletproof, you know, you're just

1071
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,760
going to end up having so much loss. But

1072
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,200
when you're feno

1073
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,880
hunting, the coast is great because

1074
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,799
especially for resistance to certain

1075
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,480
things, right? That's amazing. You can

1076
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,320
see what happens. And it's a necessary

1077
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,800
thing. You know, you can do it to a

1078
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,400
degree indoors, but it's not the same. I

1079
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,560
bred for, you know, 20, 30 years

1080
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,320
indoors. And the one advantage to it is

1081
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,920
you can, you know, I'd be getting seeds

1082
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
at Emerald Cup and I'd already have run

1083
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,119
it two times before people are like

1084
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,880
growing it outside. So, like I'm already

1085
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,640
giving you your feedback without having

1086
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,079
to wait the whole season. And it's a

1087
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,000
good control group like you know, you

1088
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,640
have your I had a seed mom room in my

1089
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,480
bedroom and then you're budding it and

1090
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,480
when you're flowering it and you can do

1091
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,480
two or three cycles or you know, five or

1092
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,079
six a year and you can really see with a

1093
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,079
control group because the environment is

1094
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,200
exactly the same. Yeah. outside, even in

1095
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,640
your greenhouse, there's different

1096
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,199
sections, different heights, different

1097
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,960
wings, like it's too it spreads it out

1098
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,639
so much that it's not as much of a

1099
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,838
control group, right? When you have just

1100
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,519
like direct indoor breeding setup, I I

1101
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,078
feel like you can get so far ahead. You

1102
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,519
can Well, I'm I'm big on pheno hunting

1103
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,839
for where the seeds are going to go. If

1104
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,119
you're going to be selling clones to

1105
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,480
people that are growing indoors, you

1106
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,920
should probably feno hunt indoors,

1107
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,280
right? If you're going to be growing and

1108
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,880
putting the seeds out in fields, you

1109
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,880
need to test them out in fields.

1110
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,720
Definitely. So, I feel like really

1111
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,240
depending on what the final use is and

1112
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,559
now it's like we can go into like is it

1113
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,919
a hash strain? Is it going to be used

1114
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,440
for flour? Is it going to be used for

1115
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,039
pre-roll where people don't care what it

1116
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,358
looks like? You know, we're going in

1117
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,119
that direction of the cruciferous. So,

1118
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,480
where it's like wild mustard turning

1119
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,480
into all these things, right? I always

1120
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,159
go 24/7, right? And people are like,

1121
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,079
"Dude, what do you mean? No, no, no."

1122
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,399
Right? I always veg 24 hours. I have for

1123
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,079
like 40 years. Wow. Right. And people

1124
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,358
are like, "No, dude. No." Right? I

1125
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,640
always have this conversation with my

1126
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,719
farm, my crew, and it it just grows so

1127
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,719
much faster, man. Like it's mostly

1128
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,319
indoor, you know? It's not as from a

1129
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,480
High Times article that you read when

1130
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,519
you were a teenager. I remember reading

1131
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,358
that in High Times, the 24/7 model. Oh,

1132
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:12,079
man. It could be, you know, like we're I

1133
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,159
was in High Times best of in like 95.

1134
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,240
You know, I I was an avid high times

1135
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,920
reader, but I don't know. Oh, it's just

1136
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,679
when I moved to Boulder and I lived in

1137
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,400
Boulder from like, you know, 92 to like

1138
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,078
99. Yeah. Everybody was just there

1139
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,160
growing and that's where I learned most

1140
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,839
of my indoor techniques, you know, and

1141
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,440
just like we were using rockwool and

1142
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,960
taking clones like I'm still using that

1143
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,880
same clone technique and it works

1144
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,440
amazing. I could clone something in like

1145
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,480
six to 10 days. Yeah. Um Yeah. I don't

1146
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,079
know. I don't know where where it

1147
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,679
originated. So, let's talk about your

1148
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,760
secrets for cloning. What do you do for

1149
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,199
cloning? You don't have to give away all

1150
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,640
There's a lot of No, you know what? I

1151
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,000
give away my best stuff every year. I

1152
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,078
give my best genetics out there and

1153
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,838
force myself to make better stuff. And I

1154
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,039
tell people like, don't hoard it because

1155
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:54,719
then you're not sharing it and it

1156
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,119
doesn't help anyone. You know, if if

1157
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,719
you're only taking a few clones, I have

1158
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,160
fun with it and I'll put tape and let it

1159
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,078
marble out before I'm going to cut it

1160
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:05,358
and cut it on a wider surface. So, you

1161
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,079
just get a big knob. Um, you know, also

1162
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,358
if you have space, take a big old clone.

1163
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,280
You know, take the big one. Save

1164
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,440
yourself like 2 or 3 weeks. You'd be

1165
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,440
amazed at how quick it'll root and how

1166
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,800
much healthier and stronger it'll root.

1167
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,240
But the most important thing to me is

1168
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,480
that you take it off of a a 7 9 11 or 13

1169
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,319
bladed leaf. Like veg your plant out.

1170
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Even if you have to do it 6 to 8 ft,

1171
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,880
even if you lose time, take healthy

1172
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,599
clones because you're taking unhealthy

1173
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,760
clones or like substandard stock. That's

1174
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,240
how all these viruses and all these

1175
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,160
things occur and it's just not worth it.

1176
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,279
Also, I only take topical merist stems.

1177
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,559
You know, I know it's easier to take

1178
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,240
from the bottom if you're hedging and

1179
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,400
you want to trim the unders and not

1180
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,279
throw them out, but those are usually

1181
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,119
like the sicker or more viral or have

1182
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,320
bugs or not that they have bugs

1183
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,480
necessarily, but even with the hop

1184
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
latent tests, sometimes the lower plant

1185
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,000
has it and the top doesn't, right? It's

1186
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,440
as if the plant's trying to grow out of

1187
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,920
it if you would just give it a chance.

1188
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,599
So, if you just veg it out and get it

1189
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,358
just healthy and luscious and take those

1190
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,720
clones, all of a sudden it's like you

1191
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,400
have a different strain. you're growing

1192
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,559
that and your friends are taking other

1193
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,400
co cuts or clones and they're wondering

1194
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,078
what you grew. You're like, "No, man. I

1195
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,680
just took a healthy clone and it's so

1196
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,200
important to take healthy clones." I I

1197
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,879
couldn't agree more. I think healthy

1198
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,879
clones and depending on where you cut

1199
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,160
the clone and how old your mom is, you

1200
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,160
don't want an old mom either. And what

1201
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,078
you just fed it and good in, good out.

1202
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,319
Yeah, we're put we're replenishing our

1203
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,039
mom stock every four months, right? At

1204
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,880
most, like no more old moms at the very

1205
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,800
Yeah. So, we have uh we have four tables

1206
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,160
and every month a table gets replaced,

1207
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,560
right? So we go through that and we go

1208
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,719
from tissue culture moms right so we

1209
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,639
want as healthy as possible you know

1210
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,799
even in a sterile environment we try to

1211
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,159
prevent crosscontamination the problem I

1212
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,079
mean not a problem but one one thing

1213
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,358
I've noticed when we grew we grew tissue

1214
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,960
culture out at the farm and we got the

1215
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,880
highest yields we've ever gotten some of

1216
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,800
the ones that we let go a little bit

1217
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,039
seated lightly I thought that was odd

1218
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,320
and I noticed had very smooth stem like

1219
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,119
none of the stem there was never a

1220
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,960
cambium layer on the stem as it grew it

1221
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,720
was like it was almost like just a

1222
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,519
smooth stemmed

1223
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,959
plant, you know. Yeah. But the thing

1224
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,719
about taking a tissue culture and

1225
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,559
putting it outside is if outside is

1226
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,559
where the viral area is and if you think

1227
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,799
about the cannabis crop as one big crop,

1228
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,639
right? Even from like the the up up in

1229
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,280
Oregon and Seattle and California, if

1230
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,000
you look at it as one big crop, it's

1231
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,760
hard to fight, you know, what's outside,

1232
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,800
it's almost vector. You know what I'm

1233
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,599
saying? we have like chemtrails and

1234
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,599
neighbors or if you're, you know, in

1235
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,359
northern Cali, you're near vineyards,

1236
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,880
there's fires and all the bugs are

1237
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,039
hopping on the birds which are hopping

1238
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,200
out and over your crop. So, there's a

1239
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,559
lot to handle. So, there's there's an

1240
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,519
argument for if you're taking a tissue

1241
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,719
culture, which is almost like less

1242
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,719
strong, you know, and you're just

1243
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,159
putting it out in that a lot of times it

1244
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,480
has a better start cuz it's cleaner

1245
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,078
vyroid wise, but it won't have as good

1246
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,639
resistance to what's actually happening

1247
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,079
outside. Plus, what's happening outside

1248
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,358
just happens to it. So, you can start

1249
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,680
with it fresh and all of a sudden it

1250
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,078
just goes out and gets diseased. It's

1251
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,440
hard, right? So, for me, it's like you

1252
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,119
just got to keep a good eye and not be

1253
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,679
afraid to throw out a percentage of your

1254
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,680
veg. Like, even if it's five or 10%. If

1255
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,358
you have enough plants so that if you

1256
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,960
notice something that you don't like,

1257
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,639
don't be holding on to that cuz you're

1258
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,280
short on plants. Don't go take that to

1259
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,879
fruition. Just

1260
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,359
keep afraid to get rid of it. You know,

1261
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,440
cull. It's hard to do sometimes if you

1262
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,598
love cannabis and you're attached to it.

1263
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,440
But no, but the best the best growers

1264
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,960
out there grow more than as far as they

1265
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,240
veg more than what they need. They take

1266
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,760
more clones than what they need and they

1267
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,399
select the best ones. I feel like that's

1268
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,400
just across the board with the best.

1269
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,318
That's just pretty standard. Yep. I line

1270
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,240
them up on a paper slicer and I put it

1271
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,318
underwater under a big a shallow

1272
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,000
Tupperware full of water. I'll put a

1273
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,039
paper slicer in there. I can take a

1274
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,199
thousand at a time and just you know,

1275
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:53,119
right? I started doing like, you know,

1276
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,719
10,000 a day, just really clone it out.

1277
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,960
And my mind is like, "Oh, how can I just

1278
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,118
like line this up better?" But I don't f

1279
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,280
or cut any leaves. Like you're asking

1280
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,960
how I clone. I don't cut any of the fan

1281
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,359
leaf cuz I feel like that like disturbs

1282
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,199
it or it's like having an open cut. So

1283
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,480
instead of like, you know, that's the

1284
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,159
first time I saw that was when I moved

1285
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,240
out here in 2010. I see people just

1286
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:15,598
jamming domes and cutting leaves and

1287
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,519
cutting half leaves just to make 50 on a

1288
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,480
on a tray. Are you doing like a 50 cell

1289
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,480
count? We do 72 but only plug half,

1290
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,838
right? Yeah. I do the 50s just work so

1291
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,039
much better. But when you start doing

1292
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:26,559
thousands and thousands and thousands,

1293
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,480
you're buying the 70s and spreading them

1294
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,960
out just because it's financials like

1295
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Yeah. The 50s though root amazing. We

1296
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,400
used to get 20 bucks a clone and we get

1297
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,400
a,000 bucks a dome for those 50s. Yeah.

1298
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,200
We were just slicing them all day, you

1299
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,720
know, of the limo G. Yeah. I mean, we've

1300
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,318
been doing trials and we've been

1301
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,078
noticing that the one and a half inch

1302
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,000
cubes get better results than the twos.

1303
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,318
Like as far as we get faster rooting, we

1304
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,239
get wider, thicker, healthier roots,

1305
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,639
right? Because it's imagine a plant,

1306
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,479
right, that's like VP like you're you're

1307
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,239
just it's drying out. It's able to feed

1308
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,599
more. It's almost like aeroponics or

1309
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,358
something. You're getting more oxygen to

1310
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,240
the roots. There's it's just bubbling

1311
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:04,078
all the time. You know, I I noticed I

1312
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,479
grew hydroponics for like 20 plus years

1313
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,560
and we would make our own setups with

1314
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,240
tubes. It was like an aeroponic with the

1315
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,679
nutrient film. And at first we were

1316
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,959
spraying the bubbles onto the roots and

1317
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,159
then the roots were just clogging the

1318
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,920
whole tube. So we would have to put the

1319
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,078
holes where the roots weren't just to

1320
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,358
airate the water, right? But you notice

1321
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,440
you could get the thing that you know

1322
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,279
those plants would eat 24/7. We would

1323
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,240
leave the CO2 on accidentally sometimes

1324
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,920
in the dark. And you know, contrary to

1325
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,559
popular belief, like I believe plants

1326
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,960
can digest CO2 in the dark, you know,

1327
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,799
because we we accidentally leave a tank

1328
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,318
on and it would just empty and we'd turn

1329
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,560
on the lights and it'd already be just

1330
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,960
perking and growing almost like it was

1331
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,480
digesting the CO2 or like slowly

1332
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,199
releasing it like a late release

1333
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,559
nitrogen keeping it and not digesting

1334
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,279
it. That's why I was going to ask you

1335
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,679
what you think about like

1336
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,519
photosynthesis as effect to like

1337
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:55,838
anthsyanins beating like the virus cuz

1338
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,519
like we have plants sometimes that the

1339
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,639
top will be green and the bottom will be

1340
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:03,199
purple or the part that gets like less

1341
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:06,318
sun will turn purple like on one piece

1342
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,399
of cannabis and I think that's very

1343
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,000
genetic specific right to the cultivar

1344
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,358
because I see a lot of the stuff and I

1345
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,679
can use an example from indoor

1346
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,920
cultivation where everybody's using

1347
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,679
these LEDs and their stuff is kind of

1348
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,039
purple. It's not that purple, but it has

1349
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,799
that purple hue. And then it's like the

1350
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,318
purple that trims off the Well, then

1351
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,160
they get the favven under canopies,

1352
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,318
right? And they have a lot of that far

1353
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,480
red. And now all of a sudden the bottoms

1354
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,079
are more purple than the tops. Right.

1355
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,838
Right. And so I think a lot of it has to

1356
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,039
do with the light spectrum. I would say

1357
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,519
they're also saying like the nutrients

1358
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:39,039
like what you feed it can

1359
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:41,039
count. Absolutely. And then you know

1360
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,239
obviously air temperature like you're

1361
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:47,440
but in respect to it you know beating

1362
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:49,358
the hop latent you know why it beats hop

1363
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,159
lat and like that Indian study that

1364
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:53,519
study out of India over there I saw that

1365
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,920
there's been a few of them and I'm not

1366
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,599
sure exactly why I think we're still all

1367
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,880
trying to figure that out right but uh

1368
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,160
it's really interesting the direction

1369
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,720
they're going in and the fact that

1370
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,039
they've identified that anthocyanins and

1371
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,279
the relationship to hop late and you

1372
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,639
know it's it's amazing because I feel

1373
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,599
like we're one step away from being able

1374
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:15,679
to breed it out as opposed to, you know,

1375
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,519
you can you can treat it with you can do

1376
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,519
mirror stem tissue culture and you can

1377
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,000
basically you're basically outgrowing it

1378
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:23,599
at that point anyway alals like some of

1379
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,920
the Israeli studies where they're like

1380
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,240
blocking the ability to mold, right? But

1381
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,000
at at some point it's borderline GMO.

1382
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,078
Like there is a line in my mind for me

1383
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,318
anyway. Yeah. Like whether you're going

1384
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,079
to use crisper or like I'm an organic

1385
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,759
gardener, organal, whatever you want to

1386
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,680
call it. Like I would rather grow

1387
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,839
organic food than grow chemical

1388
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,838
cannabis. Yeah. And I mean the thing is

1389
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,358
for me I'm not opposed to crisper and

1390
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,199
I'm not opposed to other people doing I

1391
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,440
don't do it. It's not my thing. We do

1392
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:52,480
data driven breeding. We collect as much

1393
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,720
data as possible and that gives us the

1394
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,920
you know the best opportunity to breed

1395
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,679
in the directions that we're trying to

1396
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,280
go. Yeah. The most important thing is

1397
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:00,480
data man because if you don't have that

1398
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,240
you have nothing. So like whatever

1399
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,159
you're doing wherever you're growing

1400
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,759
record it. If you're monocropping, like

1401
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,838
see the difference so that you know your

1402
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,599
area. One of the best things you can do

1403
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,679
on a large scale commercial farm is just

1404
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,920
get yourself a set of flags. Yeah. You

1405
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,440
know, and if you have a bugged area,

1406
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,720
mark a red flag. If you have an area

1407
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,400
that's not getting good water or is

1408
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,318
overwater, mark a little blue flag just

1409
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,079
to set a little flag so that you won't

1410
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:23,920
lose sight or control. Get yourself a

1411
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,760
clipboard. Be organized, of course, but

1412
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,440
yeah, know the areas, flag them out, and

1413
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,280
then when they're better, remove the

1414
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,440
flag. And that helps you like be able to

1415
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,000
handle a large area. Like if you're just

1416
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,440
one guy running a 10,000 foot farm as a

1417
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,119
lot of Northern Californians are doing

1418
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,559
right now, you're getting your ass

1419
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,358
handed to you, you know, and and you

1420
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:40,719
know what you're doing. You've been

1421
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,639
doing it your whole life, but it is

1422
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,279
still challenging. So, anything that

1423
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,960
helps, which I really recommend we have

1424
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,800
more forums and people sit down, not

1425
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,720
just on a business attribute, but really

1426
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,000
like helping each other instead of

1427
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,519
shutting each other out or saying, "Oh,

1428
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,239
I found a secret. I'm going to use it to

1429
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,759
get ahead." Think about everyone

1430
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,838
benefiting so that we can all work

1431
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,359
together. Because when we shut each

1432
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,318
other out, man, we're really just

1433
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,719
handcuffing ourselves and we've

1434
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,358
perpetuated this situation, which is

1435
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,598
like a bad domino effect of negativity

1436
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,199
when no matter what, you know, whatever

1437
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,960
drama you have, whatever cannabis enemy

1438
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,039
you think you have, it's much worse than

1439
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,920
someone outside our cannabis community.

1440
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:22,079
So, getting over it and

1441
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,680
just working together is the most

1442
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,440
important thing we can do. Not just now

1443
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,799
when things are rough, but remembering

1444
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,240
that when things get better because

1445
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,680
they're gonna get better. Of course,

1446
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,118
cannabis always provides. They're gonna

1447
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,639
get better and they're gonna get worse

1448
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,079
again. Then they're gonna get better and

1449
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,879
she wants us to remember that we have to

1450
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,480
work. It's not just easy, you know. So,

1451
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,119
tell me about this cup. You brought this

1452
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,519
awesome Chem Dog cup. Oh, yeah. Yeah. My

1453
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,720
friend Greg G from the Chem Dog. Oh,

1454
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,480
yeah. He's one of the ones that

1455
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,318
remembers the Lem from the Dead Lot from

1456
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,159
back in the 80s, which my wife is always

1457
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,759
like, "Get people to remember that

1458
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,960
you've had that limb going forever."

1459
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,599
Nice. And that's why I was so psyched

1460
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,119
we've got some 87 seeds to pop, man. And

1461
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,720
it's not just that you were younger and

1462
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,720
had better taste buds, man. Like

1463
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,239
literally, the bud was amazing back

1464
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:05,679
then. And we were trying to see if some

1465
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:06,959
of these older seeds and some of the

1466
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,199
fascinating thing about using that

1467
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,639
method to open older seeds. And what we

1468
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,879
found to be successful is that those

1469
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,799
older seeds don't have the virus. Now,

1470
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm not saying if you introduce it to

1471
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,039
the crops, they're not going to get the

1472
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,519
virus, but that older stuff just wasn't

1473
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,279
around, which is amazing. Totally. And

1474
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,039
the fact that it's skunky and neon,

1475
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,880
glows in the dark, and you were right,

1476
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,039
like when you were a kid, you had weed

1477
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,400
that stands up with the weed today,

1478
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,920
which is amazing because we didn't have

1479
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:37,200
labs. We were just breeding by look,

1480
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,358
smell, taste, you know. Well, and I

1481
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:40,960
mean, you don't have to over complicate

1482
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:42,639
cultivation, you know what I mean? We

1483
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,960
kept it simple a lot of times back in

1484
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:47,519
the day. And then, you know, I started

1485
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,358
in the 90s, the mid 90s, and then by the

1486
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,119
late 90s, it started getting really

1487
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,199
complex with recipes where people were

1488
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,559
really putting a bunch of inputs in. You

1489
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,759
know, we kept it simple. Even the guys

1490
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,440
that were growing three-part, a lot of

1491
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,359
guys just did three-part and got really

1492
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,519
good results. Oh, yeah. That's just GH

1493
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:03,279
three-part for for like 20, 30 years.

1494
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,039
That's what we got. We grew up on that.

1495
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,800
We were bred on that. Dude, there are so

1496
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,800
many It's not viscous and it can flow

1497
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,720
through any hydroponic system and at

1498
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,400
most you're adding pH up a gallon every

1499
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,719
few years. and it was affordable, you

1500
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,318
know, and it worked. And a lot of times,

1501
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,480
you know, you're growing, you're you're

1502
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:19,519
not realizing what you're missing,

1503
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,440
right? You don't know if it's you're

1504
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,358
like maybe short. People think cal mag,

1505
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,440
you know, but in reality, you might be

1506
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,799
like a tiny bit short on copper or

1507
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,400
something that when you just add that

1508
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,920
three-part mix, it just takes care of it

1509
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,160
and it just whatever whatever problem

1510
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,000
there was just goes away. Yeah. A lot of

1511
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,000
people used to grow it in soil. Yeah.

1512
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,599
with three-part with the soil mix. But

1513
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,679
it's hard cuz you're not flushing those

1514
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,000
heavy metals out. And as you become like

1515
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,199
a chrono or really into cannabis, you're

1516
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,199
going to taste that. It doesn't matter.

1517
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,639
There is no getting it out. No. And

1518
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:48,719
that's, you know, the living soil

1519
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,400
movement, you know, can living soil is

1520
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,159
great, but it doesn't have as much of a

1521
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,240
flush like the organic farmers that

1522
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,598
actually flush just Roro for the last

1523
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,679
two or three weeks, which people are

1524
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,599
like, you know, some people are against.

1525
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:01,358
the the thing with the the K andF in the

1526
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,200
living soil, like I think it's better if

1527
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,318
the whole crop is one crop. But when

1528
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,480
they're mixing it up and they have like

1529
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,039
10 different phenos in one room, it's

1530
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,519
hard because like the turpps digest and

1531
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,519
off gas, so you're just like it ends up

1532
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:14,880
all tasting the same. You ever have

1533
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,679
that? You ever see that where like one

1534
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,160
farm's all the different

1535
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:22,000
strains exactly the same cure? Man,

1536
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,679
there's so many guys up north or that,

1537
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,159
you know, you could tell the gu they're

1538
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:28,239
using seagull [ __ ] or back. I can almost

1539
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,920
smell the n when I'm tasting just from

1540
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,399
judging all these years when I'm smoking

1541
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,920
I'm like gh you know mills you know

1542
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,599
you're like you know house and garden

1543
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,920
you you just know by the look and the

1544
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,079
smell and Athena has a very distinct

1545
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,920
flavor you know and it's regardless of

1546
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,280
what you think of it or not think of it

1547
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,519
you know everyone has their own opinions

1548
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,200
but it's Athena has a distinct it's it's

1549
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,639
the best looking stuff out there it

1550
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,239
looks amazing but you can like you said

1551
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,239
and and people should know don't buy

1552
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,759
like liquid nudes you know in a and in

1553
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,239
bulk especially if you have a long range

1554
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,240
plan, buy the powder, mix your own or

1555
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,759
copies, you know, you can just just like

1556
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,118
when we were kids and we used to go,

1557
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,400
they didn't have grow stores and you

1558
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,760
you'd see something and instead of

1559
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,200
buying it, you just build it. You just

1560
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,280
reproduce it. So, like look at the

1561
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,039
formula they're using source the

1562
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,640
nutrients that you need and just buy

1563
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,400
them. Hey, and a lot of it's the grower,

1564
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,000
too, cuz you know, it's like you can

1565
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,280
have the worst grower in the world and

1566
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,960
it doesn't matter what he's using, it's

1567
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,400
probably going to be bad. But then,

1568
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,920
yeah, you have to hear the plants, man.

1569
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,440
if you can't like if you're not hearing

1570
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,960
them like you you don't have to listen

1571
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,880
like the plants will just talk to you if

1572
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,720
if you're not hearing them you know then

1573
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,400
it's not well I was bagging on rockwool

1574
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,838
a while not really bagging on it but

1575
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,559
like about the flavor and then my

1576
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,920
buddy's like dude you know the weed that

1577
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,839
I've been giving you for the last four

1578
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,119
months is all rockwool grown with Athena

1579
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:43,358
Proline and I'm like [ __ ] well it's not

1580
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,280
always just looks amazing and it's

1581
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:47,358
always nice to have fresh this stuff was

1582
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,280
absolutely amazing and you know it's

1583
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,279
like I'm a big fan of United I got the

1584
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,359
hat on today I've been using United for

1585
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,440
the last six, seven months. We've been

1586
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,199
doing trials and working with them and

1587
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,519
I'm super happy with their nutrient

1588
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:01,439
line. Was he cleaning it out or what was

1589
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,119
he flush at all or like what does he

1590
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,800
just feed it right till the end or? No,

1591
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,160
no, you you got to flush it cuz you feed

1592
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,760
to the end like it can give you heart

1593
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,838
palpitations. Like when we were first

1594
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,359
starting to grow hydro as as kids like

1595
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,119
you could take the biggest dreadlock

1596
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,358
down from the dead lot with with some of

1597
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,280
this unflushed cannabis, you know? Oh

1598
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,799
yeah. It was just like it was beyond

1599
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,240
expandable. You got to flush all this

1600
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,519
stuff in. I mean, not not with straight

1601
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,039
water, but there's, you know, you use

1602
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:24,559
molasses and other stuff in there. And I

1603
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,358
think molasses is amazing, man. The

1604
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,800
powdered molasses from uh from the last

1605
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,480
couple crops that we were using. I was

1606
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,079
amazed. Like, I've never seen anything

1607
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,800
like work that well. Like before you're

1608
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,800
doing your final deleafing of your big

1609
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,160
and you're going to lose a lot of sugar.

1610
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,599
Give it to a little bit of a heads up

1611
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,118
though so that it has time to digest it.

1612
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,119
So, it hits exactly so when you remove

1613
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,358
it, it's already in there. But I've seen

1614
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,519
just amazing like not just the tarp

1615
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:48,799
difference of crystals. I also think it

1616
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:50,480
helps just with the yield because you're

1617
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,880
just helping with a little sugar boost

1618
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,280
right at the end. Yeah. Um yeah, that

1619
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,800
powdered molasses definitely good stuff.

1620
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,760
Amazing.

1621
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,359
So, do you do synganic or you organic?

1622
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,599
We're organic, man. We're almost living

1623
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,279
soil. Like our our soils out there since

1624
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,838
2015. So, we're looking at almost like

1625
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,160
10 year old living soil. And wow. Just

1626
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,519
from like lack of funds when times have

1627
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:12,960
been tough the last couple years, we we

1628
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,639
haven't bought a whole bunch of nudes.

1629
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,639
We're just like either mixing local soil

1630
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:18,719
into it and just using what we have and

1631
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:19,838
we've gotten amazing results. It's when

1632
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,759
we realize you remember when you're a

1633
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,039
kid there's no new companies. You go to

1634
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,440
your local hardware shop and try to

1635
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:28,400
source some lime or get some wood ash or

1636
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,720
some cow manure like and it would work.

1637
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,039
So a lot of times people don't realize

1638
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,199
if you're on this regimented hydroponic

1639
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,279
schedule, you can almost just feed once

1640
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,919
or twice. You don't have to just feed it

1641
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,599
every day and just pound it. You know,

1642
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,039
that's almost more for like a commercial

1643
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,880
setup. You know, if you have just like

1644
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,119
some plants at home in some soil,

1645
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,240
beating it like hydronoots every day is

1646
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,440
not that necessary, right? And that's

1647
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,479
the thing Arian was saying. You know, if

1648
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,079
you have some plants at home or a

1649
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,838
smaller grow room, sure, grow organic,

1650
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,160
but on a big scale, it's really hard.

1651
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,480
And we've been doing it and it is hard.

1652
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:02,558
It's hard to have a giant organic to

1653
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,719
scale without spraying. And you know,

1654
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,400
you definitely get less, but it's all

1655
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,959
about integrity or what you want to do,

1656
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,720
like what you want to provide. To me, I

1657
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,960
want to make a medicine that's actually

1658
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,799
helping because that's what we're all

1659
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,159
about. So, it's been more challenging,

1660
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,839
you know, for all the farmers in

1661
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,920
Northern Cali that, you know, big up to

1662
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,759
the organic farmers. Every single one of

1663
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,680
us that works with cannabis has this

1664
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,359
opportunity to make the world a better

1665
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:30,239
place, right? So, now some people will

1666
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:32,000
pick money over making the world a

1667
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,679
better place. But we all have that

1668
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,880
opportunity to get you're chasing money

1669
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,078
and what are you going to get from that?

1670
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,079
You know what I'm saying? That's like

1671
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,440
we're here whether your mom told you

1672
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,119
this or not, but you're here to make the

1673
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,559
world a better place. You know, so the

1674
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,079
sooner you get to it, it's just like

1675
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,359
getting comfortable in your own skin.

1676
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,359
You know, the sooner you get

1677
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,279
comfortable, the better off you are,

1678
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,199
right? Cuz you're here to stay and might

1679
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,040
as well make the place better. You know,

1680
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,919
we've only have Yeah. We only have short

1681
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:58,079
moments left. So, it's like, you know,

1682
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,880
as far as we're here to stay, but we're

1683
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,280
it's our time here is so short.

1684
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,880
It flies, man. I turned 50 this year and

1685
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,240
you you know, you know, do I got a

1686
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,640
couple years I got a couple years before

1687
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,879
I turn 50, but I feel you. It's like,

1688
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,440
you know, it's it's funny cuz uh when I

1689
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,119
was a kid, I thought 50 was so old. And

1690
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,039
now that I'm like that age, it's like I

1691
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,880
don't feel that old. I still feel young.

1692
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,838
I feel 18. Every once in a while, I get

1693
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,760
a look at myself and I'm like, whoa, who

1694
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:24,799
buddies, you know? But like, yeah, it's

1695
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,240
just But that's what's nice about

1696
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,280
cannabis. You can stay young at heart.

1697
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,799
And that's one of the beautiful things

1698
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,720
about like resurrecting these old

1699
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,920
strains. It's almost like time travel.

1700
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:33,838
Like all of a sudden, you got a strain

1701
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,440
you're smoking on when you were 12. And

1702
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:36,880
when I had that limb when I was 12,

1703
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,400
there weren't a lot of people that had

1704
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,559
cannabis that were at that level. I

1705
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,119
could get anything I wanted with it.

1706
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,519
Free backstage passes. You know, I could

1707
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,838
just own the dead lot with that quality

1708
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,440
cannabis. People were moving pounds. And

1709
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:51,920
even when we were moving outdoor pounds

1710
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,760
in Boulder, we saw hundreds of pounds,

1711
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,039
but not at that quality, man. That

1712
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,640
quality was always, you could even give

1713
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:57,838
it to a farmer when you were buying

1714
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,318
wheat off them and they'd be like,

1715
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:01,838
"Whoa, what is that?" Cuz people didn't

1716
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,318
have time. A lot of the outdoor farmers

1717
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:06,639
didn't also have indoor setups. I'd go

1718
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,719
down to work big grow trim crews in New

1719
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,239
Mexico and Colorado and I'd bring some

1720
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,919
indoor that I'd grown in Boulder and

1721
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,598
people were just blown away. Like who's

1722
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,720
this kid in the trim tent with like a

1723
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,559
pound of indoor, right? Yeah. I mean,

1724
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,480
good weed can get you places. It always

1725
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,920
has been able to get you places. You

1726
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,838
know, it's funny because there's the

1727
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,240
thing is what people don't understand is

1728
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,519
there's lots of flour out there. There's

1729
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,439
always been a good amount of flour

1730
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,519
except for when there was droughts. But

1731
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,480
the quality, the good stuff, the the

1732
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:36,239
amazing that 1% stuff. Now, now you're

1733
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,159
looking at the 0.1%, but back in the day

1734
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,759
it was like 1% of the stuff was really

1735
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,199
what I thought was amazing. And then you

1736
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,559
get people forget it's a very small

1737
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,239
circle of people that have like that

1738
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,160
heightened respect or level of knowledge

1739
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,679
for cannabis. Like I remember calling

1740
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,838
into the High Times Cup a couple times

1741
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:53,679
saying, "Well, how do you guys know that

1742
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:55,838
something's 65% and 35% and they're

1743
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,719
like, well, we have a deep pool of

1744
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:00,000
internal knowledge." That was kind of

1745
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,078
got me laughing because it's kind of

1746
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,599
like when you look at Gregor Mendel or

1747
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,160
some of these geneticists where they're

1748
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,760
saying you're 25% your mom, 25% your

1749
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,318
dad, 50% a mix of all these different

1750
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,559
things. It's like kind of you know it's

1751
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:15,599
not exactly 25%. You know, you don't

1752
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,240
know if it's 21% or 26% but it's not

1753
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,318
always exactly that number. Then it's

1754
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:21,838
the same with breeding like you know

1755
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,318
people are looking for these like

1756
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,239
homozygote or to homogenize things kind

1757
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,599
of and really like I think you're

1758
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,558
looking for the hetero like you're

1759
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,480
looking for that the outlier. So I used

1760
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,400
to throw 2,000 seeds in these little

1761
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,318
Dixie cups and just go for it and I got

1762
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,400
to see so much genetic expression over

1763
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,000
the years. I cross so many different

1764
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,720
things to see what was dominant. Like

1765
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,318
blue dream is 90% dominant with anything

1766
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,480
you cross it with, you know. Well, it's

1767
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:48,318
so stable, right? And we did a lot of

1768
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,480
good Yeah. banana tps will literally

1769
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:53,119
take over any tarping profile if you

1770
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,119
cross except for mean jeans black lime

1771
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,160
like literally like you'll cross it with

1772
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,000
something and you're going to get those

1773
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:01,118
banana turpps shining through it's it's

1774
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,719
a dominant turpp crosser right um so

1775
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,640
it's cool you get to find out like the

1776
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,318
results what's happening if you cross

1777
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,838
something into something else and the

1778
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,318
thing I'm most into now is getting those

1779
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,400
old school land races with the THCV with

1780
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,039
the alals for that right hand throw for

1781
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,680
sports figures and Parkinson's and just

1782
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,119
just making real medicine that can get

1783
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:20,719
somewhere quicker than people who are

1784
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,798
doing five or 10 year studies to get

1785
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,159
there, right? You know, they may not be

1786
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:27,039
shown all the work, but you actually

1787
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,399
have something that's more, you know, a

1788
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,558
better medicine, let's say, not better,

1789
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,559
but more usable than Doug's variant or

1790
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,400
like some of those strains that came

1791
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,160
through to the market, but either were a

1792
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,760
little seated or not stable and just

1793
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:41,039
didn't make it. You know, they're not

1794
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:45,040
still around really. You don't see like

1795
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,880
THCV or CBD dominating the the uh the

1796
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,880
white market space or the retail space

1797
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,880
people ask for. It's around, but not

1798
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:55,519
like it was when when like the rage of

1799
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:58,559
CBD, you know, Mhm. was uh like when the

1800
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:00,880
gift when the gift came out, Ringo's

1801
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,960
Gift and the Sour Sue and some of those

1802
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:07,280
crosses people I grew a whole crop that

1803
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,720
summer of just CBD and I was sour.

1804
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,319
We still have those. They're dominant.

1805
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:11,838
You can just get those. You just toss a

1806
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:14,000
seed and there it is. You know, you're

1807
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:16,318
like, "Whoa, sour sue." So dominant.

1808
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,760
Totally. Um, and there's something to be

1809
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:19,838
said. I remember growing those and we

1810
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,680
have like a blackberry and a blue dream

1811
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:24,719
and we saw many strains that were super

1812
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,879
high CBD. And dude, the blackberry kush

1813
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,318
was the pretenda though. That was Yeah,

1814
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,240
it was Bud Light for sure. It looked

1815
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:31,920
amazing. Done in 5 weeks. Dude, the

1816
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,759
outdoor plants I went and saw this farm

1817
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,519
that had outdoor plants. It was just It

1818
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,520
looks so amazing, you know, walking up

1819
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,358
there. These black plants and I'm like a

1820
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:41,119
the shiny diamond, you know, that does

1821
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,558
nothing. And I got so excited because

1822
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,318
I'm like, I'm coming back to buy some of

1823
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,160
that weed. And then when I got back, we

1824
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,318
smoked it and I was just totally let

1825
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,679
down. Yep. That happened a couple times

1826
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,838
going up north. If you have a tolerance

1827
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,118
at all, it does nothing. You know, it

1828
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,159
was a rage though. All the rage. It was

1829
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,920
one of the strains that really started

1830
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:57,759
PMing pretty hard like right before the

1831
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,318
green crack. And when it's tested 8%

1832
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,720
THC, right? So like that was like super

1833
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,400
low THC. That's another problem. Yeah.

1834
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:06,879
Some of the really high turpp strains,

1835
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,318
man, can have like really low THC, you

1836
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,880
That's why people have to we have to

1837
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:13,199
re-educate or just unlearn this whole

1838
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,880
thing about THC because there's only so

1839
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,358
much room in a molecule anyway, man. So

1840
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,798
if you're if you go for the highest THC,

1841
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,358
it's so rare that you're going to get

1842
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:23,119
the highest turpp. Yeah. It almost never

1843
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:25,440
happens. There's a there's a handful of

1844
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,119
things that test really high in

1845
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,960
canabonoids and also really high in

1846
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,559
tarpen, but it's few and far between.

1847
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,599
It's like the banana. the banana when

1848
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:35,359
you know it's it's so THC high THCA high

1849
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,480
when you when you make whole plant fresh

1850
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,039
frozen out of it it's almost like a

1851
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,440
malleable white clay as opposed to a

1852
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,039
strain that has like liquid turpps and

1853
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,679
like that one has that banana turpp and

1854
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,440
it can hit super high THC but a lot of

1855
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:49,519
times you know people just get confused

1856
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,880
and they need to remember you just smoke

1857
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:53,199
a bowl and see how it is it's more

1858
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,960
important to see how it's grown you know

1859
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:57,439
like that it's grown with integrity or

1860
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,559
or you know that it's good medicine sure

1861
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,079
and that's a problem that's a problem

1862
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,839
with a lot of the edibles too, man. If

1863
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,839
you're using like distillate or like

1864
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,119
low-grade boof, it's not really medicine

1865
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:07,039
and people are going to get sick. So,

1866
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,559
you have like older people coming in or

1867
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,400
someone who's already sick who can't

1868
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,160
afford to get sicker and they're getting

1869
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,079
a product that's making them sicker and

1870
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,440
that that's really not what it's about,

1871
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,880
you know? So, we have to avoid that or

1872
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,559
else we're going to end up in lawsuits

1873
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,480
and all these things that will hamper us

1874
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,079
from bringing the medicine forward.

1875
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,119
Yeah. You know, that that's important,

1876
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,920
too, just to have integrity. as the DCC

1877
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,519
is like banning all these products, um

1878
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,240
it's obvious that like people are just

1879
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,759
not keeping it clean. Well, and it's

1880
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,078
really unfortunate that they're, you

1881
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,000
know, the whole delta 8 problem that we

1882
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,680
had guys that decided we're just going

1883
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,798
to convert all this hemp into delta 8

1884
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:43,919
because in my opinion, there's no bad

1885
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,519
molecules now. There's bad people out

1886
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,880
there that that are doing things that

1887
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:48,239
Well, just trying to regulate growing a

1888
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,760
plant is ridiculous. They don't tell us

1889
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,399
what kind of tomatoes to grow. I mean,

1890
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,079
just, you know, not the whole thing is

1891
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,960
just ludicrous and and then they just

1892
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,318
raise the tax and raise the tax and I I

1893
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,760
don't know. You start wondering like

1894
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,199
what's the plan? Is the plan to just

1895
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,040
make everyone bankrupt and corporate

1896
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:04,318
comes in and buys everyone out because

1897
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,440
they couldn't have built it and they

1898
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:08,079
can't make it. That's what you got to

1899
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,440
reme remind everybody we made this. You

1900
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,880
know, they can't make it. They can just

1901
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,119
come in and buy us out. And they can

1902
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,640
only do that if they force us all to do

1903
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,280
that. If we remember that we're the

1904
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:20,000
asset or our passion is the asset like

1905
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,079
Sherb says, remember that and like light

1906
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,960
it up, keep it in your heart chakra and

1907
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,798
just use it, you know, cuz if you get

1908
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,159
tired or you let them beat you down or

1909
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:29,838
you say to yourself, man, how am I going

1910
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:31,358
to do it? You know, they'll end up

1911
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:32,960
winning. You have to just turn it around

1912
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:35,519
even at your lowest points and just be

1913
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,838
like the cannabis plant will provide.

1914
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,838
You know, that's what it's all about,

1915
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:41,838
right? But we are fighting hard out here

1916
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:43,358
in California for sure. You're looking

1917
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,519
at cannabis is, you know, that used to

1918
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,440
be 6,000 a pound. Let's say for 30 years

1919
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,318
of my life, every pound I sold was six

1920
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,559
grand. And all of a sudden, cannabis is

1921
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:54,639
much less and everything else is up. You

1922
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:57,119
know, not just the cost of food, gas,

1923
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:58,879
cost of living out here. So, it's a real

1924
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,200
challenge. That's why you have to get

1925
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,640
really smart. Make a pie chart. Know

1926
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,078
what your percentages are. Know where

1927
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,000
your cannabis is going before you grow

1928
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,839
it. Well, you better have good quality

1929
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,079
flour. Otherwise, you will not survive.

1930
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:11,519
Oh, man. If you're not at the top, then

1931
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,960
yeah, don't even you can't even make it

1932
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,358
to step two or three. It's not even

1933
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,599
worth doing it anymore. Unless you have

1934
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,440
the the best genetics, the best flower,

1935
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,359
whatever you're doing. Like, if you

1936
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,679
don't love it, don't even try. It's not

1937
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,440
even worth it. It's just not If you

1938
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:26,960
don't wake up thinking cannabis, don't

1939
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,639
even bother, man. Well, if you're here

1940
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,318
just for the money, there's way better

1941
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,078
ways to make money these days, right?

1942
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:33,920
There's way something else. There's

1943
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,599
there's so much more out there. our two

1944
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,280
rules on our farm, you know, may they be

1945
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,920
rough or not or just smoke weed and

1946
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:43,039
don't be a [ __ ] Yeah, we just stick to

1947
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,798
that. We keep it simple. It works. But

1948
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,079
it's hard, you know, I I don't mind when

1949
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:47,759
people don't smoke cannabis, you know,

1950
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,280
if they need that to focus. But yeah,

1951
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,039
for me to really understand it and part

1952
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,160
of the disconnect with the DCC and these

1953
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,839
other groups is that they're not

1954
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:56,399
cannabis people. That's why they haven't

1955
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:58,480
helped us move forward. And I really

1956
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,920
like recommend to people, get involved

1957
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,079
in your local government before you're

1958
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,000
forced to do it on the ground level. Get

1959
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,920
in there, talk at your board of

1960
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
supervisors meeting, know that you can

1961
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,559
unseat a mayor with 50 votes. Like, get

1962
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,880
in there and make yourself a voice and

1963
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,640
activate with your community so that

1964
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,160
later on, 5 10 years, like what we

1965
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:17,440
learned down in line in California is

1966
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:18,879
they're overt taxing us. And we could

1967
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,798
have avoided this by telling them from

1968
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,960
the beginning, we can't keep the tax

1969
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:25,358
model that we had 10 years ago when we

1970
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,119
were thriving for what's going on today.

1971
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,880
It's not appropriate. It doesn't work.

1972
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,400
It's like a failed government. So, we

1973
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,079
have to like keep it fresh and new, like

1974
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,160
have representatives in your board of

1975
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,680
supervisors, have a relationship that

1976
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,038
you can talk to the mayor and say, "Hey,

1977
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,318
listen. We need to keep this lucrative

1978
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,839
for everybody, not just a one-way where

1979
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:45,838
we're just getting taxed and we're not

1980
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,679
benefiting." Yeah. So, like that's

1981
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:50,000
really important, man. The whole tax

1982
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,919
thing with the excise tax going up 25%

1983
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,519
is crazy in my And the reasoning behind

1984
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,200
that, not that, you know, Newsome just

1985
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:56,960
does this every time. is just he's just

1986
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,480
said we didn't come up with the revenue

1987
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,358
because basically we're chasing people

1988
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,199
out of here with the the permit fees and

1989
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:05,038
the taxes anyway. So that you know

1990
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:06,798
they're just going to raise it and it's

1991
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,359
going to go up to like 19 or 20%. It's

1992
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:11,599
going up 25% of what it is now and they

1993
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:13,920
may even raise it to 25% eventually

1994
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,160
because have you ever seen them lower a

1995
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,240
tax? They don't lower taxes in America.

1996
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:19,838
Sometimes they abolish them and I hope

1997
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,439
we do more of that but you know they

1998
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:22,880
don't lower the taxes and that's that's

1999
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,639
another one of the problem. Yeah. They

2000
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,280
they removed the cultivation tax which

2001
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:29,679
was basically unconstitutional taxing a

2002
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,359
crop before it's sold. So, and not that

2003
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:33,358
I'm a federalist, but that's just not

2004
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:36,159
constitutional. So, wherever the the

2005
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,679
thin line of the laws are, it it's just

2006
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:39,199
frustrating because really everyone who

2007
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:40,399
paid cultivation tax for all those years

2008
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,159
should be able to have a class action

2009
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,880
suit and get all that money back. They

2010
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:47,118
should. I agree 100%.

2011
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,599
Spanabis Europe, what are your thoughts

2012
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,838
on uh Oh, I love it, man. It's great. I

2013
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,440
love the culture, the vibe. I really

2014
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:55,119
like how they run it. I like how they

2015
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,798
give you the first booth you were in for

2016
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,559
the rest of your life so people know

2017
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:00,318
where to come back. Yeah. It used to be

2018
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,319
Amsterdam for me, like the melting pot

2019
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:03,599
or this the the gathering point in

2020
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:06,159
Europe, but it really just kind of

2021
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,519
transitioned into Barcelona, right? And

2022
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:08,960
you got to love it. It's just amazing.

2023
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:10,719
For anyone who hasn't been there, it's

2024
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,960
just mind-blowing. So, Spannabus was

2025
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:15,439
amazing. I'm glad I went. We had a great

2026
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,199
time. We sold a lot of seeds. We sold a

2027
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,280
lot of books. It was just fantastic.

2028
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,798
Today, Similas, they like the threeacks

2029
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,720
over there. Oh, yeah. They well they

2030
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:24,719
like the three-packs here now like the

2031
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,159
biggest seller. Yeah, exactly. Because

2032
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:27,439
it's more affordable. It actually you're

2033
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:29,199
bringing something like a lot of people

2034
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,798
don't have more than 20 or 30 bucks but

2035
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:32,159
they want a part of it. That's the first

2036
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:33,838
time I started seeing that in Spain.

2037
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,440
People are just like can I buy one seed?

2038
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:37,159
You're just like whoa this dude actually

2039
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,920
wants one seed. He's not joking. He

2040
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:41,838
wants one seed. Okay. So he just wants

2041
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,519
to do what he can. You know I always

2042
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,199
give more seeds in my packs. Like I'll

2043
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:46,719
give 20 seeds per pack and I'll even

2044
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,798
give like buy one get one just because

2045
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:50,639
bottom line I want people growing the

2046
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:51,599
seeds. So, I want them to have more. You

2047
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,519
know, I'm not going to give them a

2048
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,680
hundred, let's say, but I don't mind

2049
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:56,798
giving extra because if they're not

2050
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,078
growing them, you know, if you're just

2051
01:06:56,798 --> 01:06:59,679
hoarding them and people aren't growing

2052
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,039
your strain, then where is your strain

2053
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:02,480
really? Yeah. You know, if you're not

2054
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,559
sharing it and putting it out there,

2055
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,880
like, how's it ever going to be known?

2056
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,599
Yeah. I mean, I feel like that was we're

2057
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,599
we're at fault for hoarding genetics

2058
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,280
back in the day, you know, and then I

2059
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,680
saw guys like it came from keep it

2060
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,798
secret or keep it

2061
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:18,639
quiet, but we didn't want to share it

2062
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:21,679
with everybody and let our stuff out.

2063
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:24,639
And I saw us winning cannabis cups with

2064
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:26,239
genetics and and other things and us not

2065
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:28,639
letting the good stuff out. And then we

2066
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,239
got these guys with Gorilla Glue, right?

2067
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,078
They changed the game. They won the cup

2068
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:33,679
and at the same cup that they won, they

2069
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,760
gave the seed, not the seed, that they

2070
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:38,558
gave the clone out to literally

2071
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,160
everybody that wanted a a clone. I think

2072
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,319
they they might have sold them, but my I

2073
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:45,598
got one for free. Oh, man. And like

2074
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:47,358
2014, we sold like 2400 seed packs at

2075
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,559
the Emerald Cup of Gorilla Glue. Just we

2076
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,639
were the only ones that had the Gorilla

2077
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,440
Glue seed. And Oh, you had the Gorilla

2078
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,798
Glue seed back at the 2014. We made We

2079
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,639
had And we just had them for sale and

2080
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:58,559
they were just went viral. Like the

2081
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,400
people just ate it alive. They just

2082
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,839
disappeared. So, did you do you cross

2083
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,358
the Gorilla Glue with something else or

2084
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,038
you guys? Yeah, we crossed the Gorilla

2085
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:06,798
Glue and and you know when we started

2086
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,559
seeding the Gorilla Glue, it started

2087
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,798
like having auto flowers like it just

2088
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,559
there was so much cracked out of that

2089
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,400
that you got to see like where it came

2090
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:17,279
from. It looked like some Colombian.

2091
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,520
Some of it smelled like like hot licks

2092
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,239
or fireball. Oh, it it's gassy

2093
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,920
chocolaty. Like it it's really complex.

2094
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:25,439
I feel like and it's just so dang

2095
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,520
crystally, you know? There was like two

2096
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,719
versions. One was quick and one took a

2097
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,520
little bit longer, but it would like

2098
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:33,679
hang from like so much resin. Yeah. And

2099
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,520
it just took over. It kind of like made

2100
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,279
everybody stop growing the sour for a

2101
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,120
second. People were growing just sour

2102
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,960
and it transitioned into Gorilla Glue.

2103
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,358
That is

2104
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,359
exactly that is why the sour is gone is

2105
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,798
we trim nightmare. You know that when

2106
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,239
the plant you're trimming sour and the

2107
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:49,679
plant's actually talking to you, it's

2108
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,238
actually telling you I don't want to be

2109
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,520
trimmed. It's actually telling you stop.

2110
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:54,798
And you don't know cuz you're a trimmer

2111
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,400
or you're working or your boss is

2112
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,479
saying, you know, but in reality the

2113
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,838
plant just doesn't want to be trimmed,

2114
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,399
you know, especially that West Coast

2115
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:04,960
sour D that was just, you know, so much

2116
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,238
harder to get into and and trim. So I

2117
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,520
never got good West Coast

2118
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:10,639
sourdies and that was it right in the

2119
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,719
beginning. And then there was like an

2120
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,719
AJ's and there was the West Coast we saw

2121
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,399
from the West Coast was smaller yielding

2122
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,719
but way louder. So they were selling it

2123
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,238
at dispensaries and there was a west

2124
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,838
coast but I feel like it had hop late

2125
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:23,759
and it was like and then my buddy even

2126
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:25,278
tested I feel like all the diesels carry

2127
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,198
it and all the older strains like you

2128
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,920
know blue dream it won't test for it a

2129
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,838
lot but blue dream is so old and it's

2130
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,759
it's amazing like it I haven't seen it

2131
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:35,439
get sick I grow some every year I always

2132
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:38,798
have a little patch of 100 pounds on the

2133
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:41,838
side it sells in a second it it has like

2134
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:44,000
amazing resistance just cuz obviously

2135
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,359
someone put the work into it and that's

2136
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,960
a problem a lot of these these guys who

2137
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,798
are out there pollen chucking and it's

2138
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,158
awesome when you take two things and I

2139
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,079
love breeding. I love when people take

2140
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:53,679
things and mix them and try to get

2141
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:56,079
something better or something they like,

2142
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,480
but you got to remember like, you know,

2143
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,920
do the work. Like Blue Dream is is so

2144
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:02,158
good because somebody put a lot of work

2145
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,920
into it first and that's why it has the

2146
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:07,599
longevity it has. You know, you have to

2147
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:09,359
really do the work. Yeah, definitely.

2148
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,039
It's cool to mix some someone's work

2149
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:13,599
with someone's work, but you know, a lot

2150
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,840
of times grow that stuff indoors first.

2151
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,679
Grow it indoors. greenhouse and outdoors

2152
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,199
and do your research on it before you

2153
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,199
just release it because otherwise you're

2154
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:22,479
just trying to profit off something and

2155
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:23,919
giving someone you don't even know what

2156
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,519
you're giving them. Yeah. You know.

2157
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,039
Yeah. So, if you had one piece of

2158
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,719
advice for your younger self coming in

2159
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:31,760
the

2160
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:34,158
industry, what would that one piece of

2161
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,840
advice be? Oh, man. I don't know if I

2162
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,920
would take it, but I'd give it to myself

2163
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,840
just like not to be so trusting and to

2164
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,440
remember that, you know, sometimes you

2165
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,880
think someone's amazing or or you're

2166
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:44,799
really just projecting what your own

2167
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,199
beliefs or core values are into the

2168
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:52,320
person. So, just have a better filter.

2169
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:54,000
Uh, not to sound harsh. Yeah.

2170
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:55,439
Cuz you can waste a lot of time just

2171
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,158
like having a lot of heart and diving

2172
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:59,839
into something. Um, but cannabis is

2173
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,759
difficult cuz it's all brand new. You

2174
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,199
never know. Like some of the permitting,

2175
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,039
some of the initial processes that we

2176
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:08,399
got into, you know, we lost. Yeah.

2177
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:10,000
Initially, we didn't know where was

2178
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:11,759
going to get permitted first. So, we we

2179
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,960
set up permitting in Menescino and

2180
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,239
Sonoma. Mendo was rough. People have no

2181
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,520
idea. Still having a hard time. They're

2182
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,959
trying to shut the permitting down right

2183
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,159
now. Instead of like Humble, they're

2184
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,000
somewhere where they're accepting it and

2185
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:23,439
just realizing this is what we have.

2186
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,880
They're just there's a real dichotomy.

2187
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,319
There's the richer land owners that are

2188
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,679
trying to shut it down. And I

2189
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:29,279
understand, you know, they're part of

2190
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,440
the conversation. and they think it

2191
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,960
increases crime, which it doesn't. They

2192
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:34,158
just need to be educated. Everyone has

2193
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,000
to remember to just join the

2194
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:39,119
conversation. Cuz if you can't talk to

2195
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,479
people, it just forms separation. And if

2196
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:41,599
you educate them, you tell them they

2197
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:42,959
don't want people driving around in

2198
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,400
their neighborhoods. You tell them this

2199
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,679
is farming, this is agriculture. When

2200
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,839
you're harvesting wine and you're

2201
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,039
harvesting pears and grapes, you have

2202
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,400
people in the neighborhood. They're not

2203
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:52,800
creating crime. They're here to work.

2204
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:55,198
They're they're working, you know. But

2205
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,199
you it's it's a hard argument especially

2206
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:59,759
Menescino where they give the cannabis

2207
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:01,919
tax 5% of gross from us to the crystal

2208
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,840
meth task force and it's just a problem

2209
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,319
they can't solve and we shouldn't be

2210
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,640
responsible for honestly. Yeah. Like any

2211
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:11,279
cannabis tax is it just makes it so

2212
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,199
difficult. You almost wonder what is the

2213
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,840
purpose because nothing else gets taxed

2214
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,359
like us, you know, and here we are.

2215
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,039
We're a medicine like we're essential

2216
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:21,279
during COVID, right? But this is the

2217
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:23,479
price we pay for having legal cannabis,

2218
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:25,840
right? So

2219
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:27,519
unfort lobby groups and we're working

2220
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,960
together. That's why if you're out there

2221
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,920
in one of these burgeoning states or

2222
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,600
just starting off, form alliances early.

2223
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,920
Get in there with your local lawyers and

2224
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,360
activists and, you know, don't pay them

2225
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,880
necessarily. Offer them a percentage,

2226
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,799
but get on an initiative where you're

2227
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,880
moving in a direction that you won't,

2228
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
you know, get into a jam one year, 5

2229
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,039
year, 10 years down the line. Have your

2230
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,320
plan and project. Look ahead. Cuz if

2231
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:51,119
you're in it and you love it and you

2232
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:53,799
know you're in it forever, see ahead and

2233
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:56,479
try to project like out here for us,

2234
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,800
PG&amp;E has all these rate hikes. So get

2235
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:00,718
solar and get solar quick cuz seriously

2236
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,560
know that if you want longevity and

2237
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:06,000
you're a solar farmer or or a cannabis

2238
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:08,000
farmer at all, get solar with it because

2239
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,840
they're going to increase your cost of

2240
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,679
production by so much eventually that

2241
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,400
it's going to start hurting on top of

2242
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,239
your labor. Like know that you you may

2243
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,000
not want to trim your whole harvest, put

2244
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:19,839
some of it towards an edible cuz edibles

2245
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,840
are the only thing that's gone in an

2246
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,440
increase in value in the last 10 years

2247
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,920
while flour and everything else is

2248
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,919
depreciated. you see a candy bar, let's

2249
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,399
say a kea bar that was five, six bucks

2250
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,319
is like four or five times that now. So,

2251
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:34,000
I think edibles are a big part of it.

2252
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:35,599
And if you can keep it organic, that

2253
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,279
that's amazing. Like get your product,

2254
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,079
let's say, on Whole Foods shelf in five

2255
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:42,000
or 10 years or just have a projection or

2256
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:44,158
a vision of where you want to take what

2257
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,198
you're doing. Yeah. And uh just stick to

2258
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,879
that cuz everybody knows just what to

2259
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:50,559
do, just not everybody does it. You

2260
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,960
know, people know what's good and what's

2261
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,400
right. They just get sidetracked. So if

2262
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,239
people are looking to find out more

2263
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:59,759
about Lem from Lampire

2264

2272

2276
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:28,960
enjoy it. It's not like bothering me.

2277
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:31,519
I'm up at 2 three in the morning anyway.

2278
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,560
I get after it. I don't sleep a lot. And

2279
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:36,880
so, uh, yeah, hit me up. We got a lot of

2280
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,440
FourZs coming. I'm hoping to do a collab

2281
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,880
even with you or we want to boost it and

2282
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:42,238
get it into some nurseries so that we

2283
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,400
can make it more available. We get a lot

2284
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:46,158
of orders for like 10,000 and 20,000.

2285
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,879
And our nursery is small. We're only

2286
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:50,639
producing like 5 6,000 per season. And

2287
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,960
that's why we've been successful without

2288
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,239
having like Vyroids. And you know, I

2289
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,600
don't know how good it would be, but I

2290
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,759
know there's some good spots out there.

2291
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,560
Radio Ridge and we've had them run our

2292
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,199
stuff before. Solid people. Solid people

2293
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,520
out there. Ryan, Eva. Yep. Jordan, Ryan,

2294
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:07,678
and Ava doing it. They got really nice,

2295
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,520
healthy stock. And it's really hard. You

2296
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,039
know, you got to be careful. Yeah. It's

2297
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,120
I recommend just getting them from one

2298
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,479
spot and not getting clones from a bunch

2299
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:16,079
of different spots cuz you never know

2300
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:17,279
what you're getting, what you don't see.

2301
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,238
Yeah. Yeah, you know, you see someone in

2302
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,000
the street, you don't know if they have

2303
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:21,519
a cold or not. It's the same thing with

2304
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,719
plants. Like plant could look amazing,

2305
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,640
you know, and then you put it with your

2306
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,158
other plants and you don't even know

2307
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,400
what it has cuz they haven't even found

2308
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:31,198
out. Those eggs don't hatch, you know.

2309
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,479
Yeah. It's like you got to be so careful

2310
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:33,919
when you're introducing new stuff.

2311
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,439
That's why seeds are so great. You just

2312
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,800
start fresh with your own seeds. You

2313
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:38,639
don't need clones from anymore that you

2314
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,320
can get hopen from seed. So you really

2315
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,039
have to know your source. That's why we

2316
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,960
went that's why we opened those 87 like

2317
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,198
yeah super sativa seed lover seeds and

2318
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,640
some centy seed bankank skunk one seeds.

2319
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,399
We opened a bunch of different ones and

2320
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,920
I was betting or just praying on the

2321
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:55,198
skunk one and that's the one that did

2322
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:57,679
well and man it is just the stank of

2323
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,039
dank just you know it's so fun showing

2324
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,880
friends of mine that haven't seen it in

2325
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:03,279
like 20 or 30 years. Rest in peace Sam

2326
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,039
the skunk man for all your contributions

2327
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:06,719
to our industry. You know, we're talking

2328
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,960
about we're talking about so many of the

2329
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:11,760
legends out there, man. Franco, like

2330
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,198
there's so many people that like, you

2331
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,440
know, they they basically paved the road

2332
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:16,639
that we're walking and driving on today,

2333
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:18,399
you know, and some of them are still

2334
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,840
around like Chichin Chong and some of

2335
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:21,599
these guys are still out there doing it

2336
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,920
and just leading the way with integrity,

2337
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:26,400
doing it right. Oh, yeah. Ed Jorge,

2338
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,279
Robert Connell, Clark. Yep. All these

2339
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:30,799
guys that stood up for the plant on so

2340
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:32,399
many different levels, too. You know,

2341
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,360
it's guys standing up in court for the

2342
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:37,359
plant, guys writing books, guys writing

2343
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:39,679
books before it was okay to write books

2344
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:42,279
where you, you know, education George

2345
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:45,119
Van Patton or Jorge Cervantes or and

2346
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:47,519
Edank putting out Frank big time putting

2347
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:49,840
out the education. Education is the key,

2348
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,520
man. Even in in the industry or in

2349
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,800
retail, if you can just take a minute,

2350
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,480
like when these dispensaries first

2351
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,159
opened, it was more of a medical

2352
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,759
approach and you'd spend 20, 30 minutes

2353
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,198
with somebody trying to see what they

2354
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,679
needed or putting them in the right

2355
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:03,198
direction. And that can go so far in

2356
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,480
establishing a relationship with a

2357
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:06,399
customer that's more than just an

2358
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:07,599
in-n-out. You know, if you treat

2359
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:09,599
somebody like they're going to be there

2360
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,520
for the next 5 or 10 years, you can go a

2361
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,520
lot further with them if you just listen

2362
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,640
to them. Um, yeah, a lot of these

2363
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,000
people, believe it or not, are coming

2364
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,280
into the dispensaries, like a third of

2365
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,880
them, they've never been in one before.

2366
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:20,158
They're a brand new customer. They've

2367
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,000
probably never even been exposed to

2368
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:24,158
cannabis. So, they need more than an

2369
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,319
initial like introduction or education.

2370
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:28,000
They just they need to know like they're

2371
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:29,679
there for a reason. The plant energy

2372
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,719
brought them there. Like whether it's

2373
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,800
the fact that they're putting their

2374
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,279
pharmaceuticals down or whatever it is

2375
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,360
the cosmic energy has brought them to

2376
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:38,960
where they are now and they just have to

2377
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:40,960
come in and just learn, you know,

2378
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,239
totally. That's why it's up to us as

2379
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,560
stewards of the planet to keep it

2380
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:46,000
organic and keep it medicine because

2381
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,120
people don't understand the destruction

2382
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,399
or damage you're doing when you're

2383
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:50,640
putting something on the shelf that's

2384
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:52,158
actually like destructive. Well, you're

2385
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,600
putting something in your body that's

2386
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:55,279
poison and people are doing it every day

2387
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,800
with if you're already sick, man. You

2388
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:59,039
know, I mean, it's like Yeah. That's

2389
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,199
like what's happening with us with just

2390
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:03,600
health food with the food in general

2391
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:06,319
health from eating poisons on top of all

2392
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,920
the chemtrails and graphite in the air

2393
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:10,238
that we have to just like fight to

2394
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,600
survive. But you have to be so conscious

2395
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:13,439
not just of the cannabis you smoke but

2396
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,840
of the food you eat, the way you treat

2397
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:19,599
your body, your mind, right? Keeping an

2398
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:21,920
open, you know, it's challenging, man.

2399
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,079
As a cannabis farmer, you have to know

2400
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,480
it all. It's not just like knowing

2401
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:30,000
plumbing, electric. It's it's deeper

2402
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:32,559
than that. It delves into like HR and

2403
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,640
emotional IQ and I mean, you know, I I

2404
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,159
have 15 20 people working for me and and

2405
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,920
I I never knew I was going to be dealing

2406
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:40,319
with like their relations and their

2407
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,719
inter relations. And it's just a broader

2408
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,920
scope as you upscale. You have to be

2409
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,279
ready for things that you weren't

2410
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,520
planning for. Like it's part of the

2411
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:49,679
American dream, right? You take a big

2412
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,040
bite out of the cheeseburger and and

2413
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,480
sometimes you choke on it a little bit,

2414
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:54,960
but eventually you get there. It's not

2415
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,879
exactly what you plan, but you get what

2416
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,399
you wish for. So remember that. You

2417
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,319
know, people say be careful what you

2418
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:02,639
wish for. I say just dream big. You

2419
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:04,000
know, go for it. Attack it and it'll

2420
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,000
come to you. Like to people who want to

2421
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
get into the cannabis space, even though

2422
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
it's crowded or it may seem challenging,

2423
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,920
if it's where your heart is, dive in,

2424
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:17,279
man, cuz people, we need you. You know,

2425
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:19,199
any kind of love energy is lasting and

2426
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,800
you'll be in it. It's here. It'll be

2427
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:22,238
here for your whole life. Well, dude,

2428
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,400
thank you so much for coming on the show

2429
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:26,158
today. Thanks for the amazing cup.

2430
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:28,000
Thanks for the flower. You got some

2431
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,920
rosin here for me, too. I love I got

2432
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,520
that 4Z rosin. So, thank you very much.

2433
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,800
And man, let's do this again sometime.

2434
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:36,840
All right, we'll do a farm tour one of

2435
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,840
