grew up like where everything was super

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,118
Hush Hush like my dad always had a fake

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,640
job that I'd tell my teachers about like

44
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,360
I mean it wasn't fake but you know it

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,479
was it was a cover

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,720
job and so switching to going to

47
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,759
somewhere like Spain which was always a

48
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,318
dream place to visit I think for a lot

49
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,479
of people Barcelona is just an

50
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,878
incredible City and having you know

51
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,719
hundreds of people recognize our strains

52
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,318
and thousand tell us they love them yeah

53
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,439
thousands SAR thousands of people yeah

54
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,439
it's crazy spannabis is always is a

55
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,239
really really special experience yeah

56
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,919
it's my favorite event you know I guess

57
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,319
Germany was amazing this show I didn't

58
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,598
go to Germany but I heard that was

59
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,158
amazing but spannabis is the best it's

60
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,518
it's my favorite event of the year it's

61
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,079
where I get to see my friends from all

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,560
over the world MJ Biz is its own thing

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,400
and that's cool too but nothing like

64
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,640
spannabis there's just so much passion

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,800
there yeah well it it reminds me of like

66
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,238
the good old days like you know original

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,280
Emerald cup and I didn't even start

68
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,000
going Emerald cup until like 2017 but

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,840
yeah you know it's it's people people

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,919
who are just truly Gathering From like

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,598
passion around cannabis and I think you

72
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,798
know a part of that is the fact that

73
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,560
they don't have like super recreational

74
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,200
industry it's kind of that gray Market

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,840
especially for genetics and so you know

76
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,639
you have a lot of these super unique

77
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,959
characters that just really love to grow

78
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,359
and and then you have like the total

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,039
alternative which is MJ biscon and it's

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,280
you know all the suits in the industry

81
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,759
which is really my thing yeah so like MJ

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,400
Biz has really grown on me over the

83
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,639
years and I feel like the last year was

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,400
really good because it was about people

85
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,158
that wanted to do business and there are

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
the suits and there the PE like the

87
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,560
hybrid people like me where I deal with

88
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,598
the people that are suits I mean I don't

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,000
consider myself a suit but at a certain

90
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,798
point just like your dad I would say

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,639
that he has to deal with a lot of Suits

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,519
yeah well you know at a certain point

93
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,399
once you're like growing on developing a

94
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,480
business it's you have to you know you

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,920
have to shake hands and get down with

96
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,000
the certain crowds and I think being

97
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,598
able to you know fit in in both those

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,120
situations is definitely part of what

99
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,919
makes us successful but at the end of

100
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,039
the day I would way rather hang out with

101
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,438
SP his crew totally totally and it's

102
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,000
like that in Mexico and it's like that

103
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:07,878
I'm sure Germany's like that and all

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,680
these not all of the other events but a

105
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:14,120
lot of the other events they have that

106
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,519
2010 Vibe like 2000 West Coast yeah

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,720
event Vibe where we had High Times

108
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
Canabis cups and emerald cups and it was

109
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,840
just it wasn't about the money and

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,799
people the money was like secondary and

111
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,758
now you see these events like MJ Biz and

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
I think the money is first unfortunately

113
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,120
well I think and you know that kind of

114
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,239
speaks on like the entire industry in

115
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,038
California almost anywhere that's gone

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,400
recreational at this point it it kind of

117
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:40,918
draws in the the wrong kind of energy

118
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,519
people we were just talking about it

119
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,038
people seem to look at cannabis as

120
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,719
almost like their golden ticket they're

121
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:49,000
like this is this is my identity now and

122
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,400
you know I'm going to make a bunch of

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,199
money off of it and right there's no

124
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,359
like true passion a lot of them don't

125
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,400
even well their their passion is coming

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,840
from the wrong place I I totally agree

127
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,399
and I mean I think that's why this show

128
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,918
is good cuz we get so many passionate

129
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:06,439
people that are beyond that or they were

130
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:08,198
before that and they see the value of

131
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,478
cannabis for what it is and it's so much

132
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:14,478
more than money right like that's just a

133
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:17,560
byproduct of amazing cannabis I think

134
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,240
that slowly but surely this this Market

135
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,478
with recreational is kind of going in a

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,960
bad Direction in a lot of ways but also

137
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,318
the people that are really passionate

138
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,918
they would do it whether there was no

139
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,960
money or not yeah well you know it's

140
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,000
it's become like a pretty you know vol

141
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,918
and ruthless industry and like you know

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,279
the people who are getting really

143
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,198
competitive about it and bottoming out

144
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,519
the prices in the market like those

145
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,038
aren't the people at the end of the day

146
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,038
that are really just truly passionate

147
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,439
about the plant but it sucks because the

148
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,800
reality of that is it's weeded out a lot

149
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,079
of really really amazing people who you

150
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,960
know were highly dedicated to

151
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,918
cultivating in a symbiotic way with our

152
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,560
local areas and you know truly just

153
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,758
doing it to like produce the medicine

154
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,680
that they love yeah I mean that's

155
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
unfortunate and it is also getting rid

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,038
of the really bad GS too which that's

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,520
the part I like yeah because there was a

158
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,439
lot of I have some friends that were

159
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,839
just getting by on middle grade flow and

160
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,038
it's like you can't do that anymore uh

161
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,638
if you're producing stuff for $650 a

162
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,038
pound and you can't sell it for seven

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,598
you know then you're you're just in a

164
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,560
bad place yeah yeah the margins

165
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,079
definitely aren't what they used to be

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,478
no they're they're not even close to

167
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,279
what they used to be and it's just it's

168
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:30,079
a real struggle for a lot of people and

169
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,318
a lot of good people yeah and no it's

170
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,159
it's a it's been a hard process to watch

171
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,639
cuz you know for me I grew up in you

172
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,759
know I grew up in the Emerald Triangle I

173
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,240
grew up in Humble County and so cannabis

174
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,120
was always just a major aspect of my

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,160
community it was you know something that

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,319
I never even like thought twice about

177
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,759
until probably like my first dare class

178
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,120
I was like oh wow this isn't just

179
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,960
another vegetable I guess but you know

180
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,360
it was but it was treated like that as a

181
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,519
kid it well you know it was just it was

182
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,240
a communal commodity right and um well

183
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,839
the economy in Humble was really based

184
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,120
around cannabis you know there's no

185
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,959
other way to look at it like from the

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,918
late 70s on like it just grew momentum

187
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,159
and I feel like the whole it's it's what

188
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,680
built Humble County medino County

189
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,039
Trinity I think a lot of the economy was

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,199
based around it and there's you know

191
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,918
it's it's an amazing beautiful thing too

192
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,400
yeah absolutely agree with that because

193
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:30,079
you know for me it was like I grew up

194
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,519
just watching all of the The Growers

195
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,439
like seriously support the local

196
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,878
community on their backs and you know

197
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:40,038
when it came to our nonprofits and you

198
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,520
know our school fundraisers it was the

199
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,800
grower families that were there

200
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,680
supporting and even though we might not

201
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,280
have been paying conventional taxes the

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,720
money came around like there was

203
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,959
definitely some people who were in and

204
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,120
out and didn't invest in the local

205
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,120
economy but at the end of the day I

206
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,840
think now you can really see the

207
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,399
difference that it made in the area

208
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,000
because you know business are struggling

209
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,719
and it's you know it's a major effect

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,279
now that things have shifted and it's

211
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,879
definitely sad to see it but you know

212
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,478
that's part of what made me like grow up

213
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,680
to know and love what I do and you know

214
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:18,079
the Cannabis industry as a whole so much

215
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,759
was just seeing the way it kind of tied

216
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,918
everybody together and one of my

217
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,680
favorite stories is uh our our annual

218
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,719
pie auction at our school and it was

219
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,598
always this crazy like competitive thing

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,919
where whatever grower dad had the best

221
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:32,879
Harvest he was buying an $800 pie that

222
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,478
year wow and they'd do it auction style

223
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,679
so they'd be going back and forth and

224
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,839
they'd be like I I'll do 500 and you

225
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,038
know it was it was the way of giving

226
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,880
back and it was you know it was a little

227
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:47,039
bit more you know authentic and direct

228
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,399
than the way things are handled now I

229
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,879
mean I know as a cannabis business I

230
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,679
don't get the choice of allocating my

231
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,838
tax money where I would like it to go

232
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,319
and back then in Humble that was kind of

233
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
how it went you were like I want to

234
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,320
support the school I want to support the

235
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,120
local nonprofit you know my stepmom uh

236
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
still works for epic which is

237
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
Environmental Protection information

238
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,160
center and she said back then they would

239
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,039
come in and grows would just drop off a

240
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,838
bag of cash anonymously and be like I

241
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,120
want no credit nothing else but they

242
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,959
just want to do the right thing I'm just

243
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,399
I'm just here to you know take care of

244
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,639
my local area it was a beautiful thing

245
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,278
yeah it's wild I mean you know that

246
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,360
maybe some people didn't pay

247
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,879
conventional taxes but they did prison

248
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,639
sentences for us to get to the point

249
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,159
where we're at and I think yeah a lot of

250
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,480
people forget that I think we're very

251
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,360
shortsighted sometimes especially these

252
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,120
people that weren't here before and now

253
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,039
have come in as investors or come in

254
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,639
they didn't they didn't know what it was

255
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,159
like before or the struggles that people

256
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,799
went through to get us to the point

257
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:50,519
where we're at now yeah I mean

258
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:53,679
absolutely it was you know it was crazy

259
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,200
times and like I said you know I grew up

260
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,559
with my dad as a grower but he always

261
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,720
kind of had his side job it was right

262
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,838
for the county and he was doing you know

263
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,040
local freshwater surveys and um you know

264
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,760
it it was it was great that he did that

265
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,319
but at the end of the day it was such a

266
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,120
hidden thing at the time and so just

267
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,240
seeing the way that it shifted and like

268
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,799
you couldn't really talk about it yeah

269
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,200
well it was it was definitely a lot more

270
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,838
like a forbidden topic if that makes

271
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,360
sense everyone knew that it was there

272
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,399
and everyone was kind of doing it but

273
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,399
nobody was discussing it in the ways

274
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,440
that we do now and so on podcasts yeah

275
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,200
yeah well exactly it's it still feels

276
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760
foreign to me sometimes when I sit down

277
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,879
or you know start talking about it or

278
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,519
see a camera rolling around at our farm

279
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,278
I'm like uh this feels a little off but

280
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,519
totally well we have all these

281
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:47,639
dispensaries now and it's like you know

282
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,480
and I think I someone posted the other

283
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,440
day I think it was Maya from M was

284
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,480
posting about how outdoor is great and I

285
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,839
think there's a lot of people that she

286
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
thinks it's a superior product and I

287
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,440
think it's in a lot of ways it's a

288
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,440
superior product and I think the reason

289
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,639
for that is most people never get to

290
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,440
experience outdoor in its peak and its

291
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,600
prime when it's at the the perfect time

292
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,000
after it's harvested and cured out it's

293
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,839
such a short little window and so people

294
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,839
were like well indoor is better and it's

295
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,160
like okay well indoor is better why

296
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,440
because it looks better yeah you're like

297
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,159
have you ever had a freshly cured fire

298
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,639
jar of outdoor I don't know if you'd say

299
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,519
that yeah and it's not all about looks

300
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,200
and I think we Instagram has kind of

301
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,278
perpetuated this thing that it has to

302
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,879
look a certain way and I mean yeah we

303
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,639
eat with our eyes right at the end of

304
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,320
the day people are looking at stuff they

305
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,000
they want stuff that looks amazing but

306
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
some of the best stuff I grew up with it

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,399
didn't look good it just made you feel

308
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,120
amazing or it tasted absolutely amazing

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,759
or both I've had yeah I mean I've had

310
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,000
like you know we big fenal hunts every

311
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,919
year it ends up getting narrowed down to

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,440
Major taste test time and I've seen so

313
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,479
many samples where I wouldn't have

314
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,880
necessarily gone and picked it out of a

315
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,039
jar on the Shelf but I try it and it's

316
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,519
like that flavor profile it just it hits

317
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,120
right I don't know how else to say it

318
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,959
totally it's so funny it checks all the

319
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,440
boxes for me and and you know I've had

320
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,078
some amazing indoor too I've had some

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,519
great mix light but at the end of the

322
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,198
day it's it's something that's never

323
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,000
really made that much sense to me to put

324
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:23,559
things in an artificial environment and

325
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,600
you know expect it to produce to its

326
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,599
full potential right well I think hiding

327
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,440
from the police is why we did it

328
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,560
originally and had we not had a do that

329
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
it would be a whole different world yeah

330
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,679
but absolutely I still love good indoor

331
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,240
don't get me wrong I smoke mostly indoor

332
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,039
but this time of year is when like the

333
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,839
good outdoor you know it's like we're

334
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,000
starting to see Amazing Outdoor coming

335
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,240
down and like through the end of the

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,440
year it's going to be at its peak and

337
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,759
there's all kinds of good stuff but when

338
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,120
you look at a plant when you're feno

339
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,198
hunting a lot of people don't understand

340
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,560
this they think you can just walk

341
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,120
through the field and pick the winners

342
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,039
it's like it's not that easy half the

343
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,560
time the stuff that I think is amazing

344
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,319
that checks all the other boxes when it

345
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,679
comes to the smoke test it's like

346
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,639
sometimes it's a big let down other

347
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,000
times it doesn't translate in the flower

348
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,039
oh yeah no definitely and that's why I

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,559
mean we get a lot of questions about

350
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,958
this CU you know we' do our massive feno

351
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,679
hunts and that was you know one of the

352
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,559
few things that we took from the whole

353
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,239
legalization thing yeah and we're like

354
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,119
actually stoked about it we were like we

355
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,879
can actually look at 10,000 plants in a

356
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,519
field now and that's something that we

357
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,799
never had access to before you

358
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,639
definitely weren't blowing up your

359
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,479
Gorilla Grow with 10,000 plants at the

360
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,278
time and so you know it it definitely

361
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,360
expanded our Horizon but that's the

362
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:39,720
first step in my process is I go and I I

363
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,879
try to eliminate certain factors I smell

364
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,920
it I look for things that I know I like

365
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,240
or you know whatever trait we're looking

366
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,799
for in a particular cross and then you

367
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,399
know there's so much more to it after

368
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,078
that then you have to go test it you

369
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:55,360
have to smoke it like a lot of the time

370
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,239
your ey is telling you something

371
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,560
completely different than you know what

372
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,600
your actual results are going to

373
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,039
so for sure it's a you know it's

374
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,639
definitely a major reality well 10,000

375
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,278
plants so I have a most people wouldn't

376
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,399
even understand what it looks like to do

377
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,078
a 10,000 plant feno hunt that's pretty

378
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,440
wild and then you can't really smoke

379
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:16,120
everything so you have to eliminate a

380
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,720
whole bunch of stuff right out the gate

381
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,480
because yeah I mean if I'm gonna like

382
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,278
just average up numbers I it's it's

383
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,720
crazy because I take two clones off of

384
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,439
Every Plant too so the first year we did

385
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,160
the big 10,000 plant hunt we had 20,000

386
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,639
clones we had to keep them alive for

387
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,759
like you know a month and a half two

388
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,879
months and I'm like [ __ ] like this is

389
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,159
kind of stressful but you know at the

390
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,480
end of the day we ended up killing 99%

391
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,120
of them maybe keeping like 50 or 100 and

392
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,120
that's like you know what we narrow it

393
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,159
down to every year and then it

394
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,519
progresses onto the next steps of the

395
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,078
process which of course is testing

396
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,560
smoking growing them in different

397
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,239
environments and once it passes every

398
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,000
single one of those categories that's

399
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,799
when you actually have a winner yeah

400
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
it's not like you know we we can't walk

401
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,359
out into the field and say hey this is a

402
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,519
winner and this is going to be the one

403
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,000
it doesn't work like that no but yeah I

404
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,720
mean you guys are working on early

405
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,679
finishers I think you guys are working

406
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,240
on triploids I've heard I've heard all

407
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,159
kinds of amazing stuff that you guys are

408
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,440
doing yeah we we uh try to keep it

409
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:20,278
interesting yeah um you know that's one

410
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,519
of the fun things about breeding is it's

411
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,838
a constantly evolving industry and you

412
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,399
know there's always something new and

413
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,000
fun to do uh the tripl blades was

414
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,240
definitely a cool one I think lyi and

415
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,799
enal is a fun thing to play with overall

416
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,639
we've seen a lot of success with that in

417
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,318
other crops like watermelons

418
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,480
strawberries for example are like an

419
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:41,759
octoploid I believe so you know it's

420
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,800
something that is a Major Tool in

421
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:49,879
agriculture but then again I also find

422
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:53,240
that just looking and tasting and

423
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,439
sampling is honestly like more

424
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,039
successful for you know having amazing

425
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,000
results than taking 100% the scientific

426
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:03,919
route yeah it just doesn't work it

427
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,720
doesn't pen L I think it has to be even

428
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,879
like 50/50 of both I would say we we try

429
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,759
to take a super scientific approach to

430
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:14,759
our breeding but at the same time it's

431
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,399
like you have to you know seriously be

432
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:20,199
into consuming cannabis to actually

433
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,318
successfully fenal hunt or find anything

434
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:26,039
right yeah the the Tesla only tell you

435
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,559
so much about the plant it's like you

436
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,480
know we take a whole bunch of uh data

437
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,359
points when we're feno hunting and

438
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,600
that's all good but at the end of the

439
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,560
day it's really you got to pass the

440
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,920
smoke test right and uh you know I think

441
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,278
more and more people want early

442
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,198
finishers so now you can narrow it down

443
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,399
to stuff that finishes early uh because

444
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:45,278
everybody's trying to beat everybody

445
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,958
else to

446
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,480
harvest you know it's wild classic it

447
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:52,000
you know it seems like it kind of it's

448
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,720
like that the pendulum always swings

449
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,559
different ways in my opinion because we

450
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,360
work with a lot of outdoor farms and so

451
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,159
particularly with outdoor you see the is

452
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,680
one year we'll get a lot of early rain

453
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,359
and people are like [ __ ] the early

454
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:07,720
strains all my late stuff came out the

455
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,798
best one year you know we end up having

456
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,318
a super late winter and their early [ __ ]

457
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:15,359
is just super Prime amazing and so it's

458
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,359
it's funny to see the way it shifts and

459
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,399
you know there are a lot of different

460
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,359
like environmental factors that you

461
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,679
consider with outdoor growing but at the

462
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,119
end of the day it you know it just what

463
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,720
it feels right well there's something to

464
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,519
be said for long flowering varieties too

465
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,200
like I I think that ignoring those is

466
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,000
just I don't know word stupid but I

467
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,880
think that like we get so stuck into

468
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,599
some that we we basically bottleneck

469
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,080
ourselves into these things like purple

470
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,678
candy gas it's all got to be purple

471
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,480
candy gas until the trend gets blown out

472
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,519
yeah exactly and then everything's that

473
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,640
for a while and then we got to go in

474
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,160
another Direction I mean I think the

475
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,520
best way to do is go in all these

476
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,120
different directions and then as the

477
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:58,200
market pivots you can shift from one to

478
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:00,119
the next but I really like longer flying

479
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,840
varieties I like like the effect of

480
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,678
sativas not all sativas but same thing

481
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,480
with not all you know the shorter

482
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,200
flowering varieties The Wider Leaf

483
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,400
varieties that are the more narcotic

484
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,360
stuff some of them I like and some of

485
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,600
them I just it's not for me yeah yeah I

486
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,678
can definitely see where you're coming

487
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,079
from there we'll love a good sativa when

488
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,280
it's the right time for it yeah for sure

489
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,519
there's just so many different things

490
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,240
it's like white Thorn Rose is another

491
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,240
one I really like that's really gotten

492
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,679
popular yeah like everybody knows about

493
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,120
it our producer was telling me he bumped

494
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,280
into somebody recently and asked them

495
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,519
what they were buying from the dispenser

496
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,519
and they're like white Thorn Rose and

497
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,319
I'm like that's awesome I know that

498
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,000
one's that one is a really honestly

499
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:39,960
amazing strand it has super unique tping

500
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,519
profile in my opinion and it does and it

501
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,079
has this effect just yeah well that's

502
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,839
what I was going to say it just just

503
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,519
right I don't know what it is but I mean

504
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,519
I call it Feelgood weed and that's what

505
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,440
I really like is when something just

506
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,599
checks that Feelgood box where like I

507
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,320
could smoke it in the morning the

508
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,399
afternoon evening it doesn't matter and

509
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:00,038
it makes me feel really good and it's

510
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,880
not like it checks that s native box or

511
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:04,599
that really uh one the stimulant side

512
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,080
it's like right there where it's like

513
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,240
okay it makes me feel good and I feel

514
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,000
like most people in the world if they

515
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,000
were able to experience and get the same

516
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,440
feeling that I get from that they would

517
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,038
really like weed the THC thing as much

518
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,960
as it is relevant it's something that

519
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,879
it's kind of like driving the entire

520
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,519
world of breeding at this time I feel

521
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,520
like un yeah unfortunately I mean I've

522
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,798
I've never like gone out and been super

523
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,839
Amazed by a plant just because I I think

524
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:35,158
it's going to have high THC right 37%

525
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,839
it's got to be a winner yet there are

526
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,039
some 37% varieties that I think are

527
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,519
absolutely amazing and but then 37%

528
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,119
because the testing is all over the

529
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:48,038
place from one lab to the next it's like

530
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,798
what is 37% really you know yeah I mean

531
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,919
that's that's another thing that's you

532
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:55,038
know a serious concern honestly is it's

533
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,960
it's not meant to be a for-profit

534
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,558
industry if you want accurate test

535
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,880
results and it that's what it is

536
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:03,119
and so it's become competitive of course

537
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,840
and you know next thing you know you

538
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,399
have one lab calling you up being like

539
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:10,480
well I'll give you 10% higher than this

540
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,880
guy if you switch over well in the

541
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,880
second it's incentivized it's incent

542
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,960
it's an incentive for people to cheat

543
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,880
and to falsify the records and that's

544
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,558
the problem I think I'm not big on

545
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,520
government oversight with anything

546
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,240
except for testing I think we need more

547
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,759
oversight on testing um you know testing

548
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,159
for pesticides and all that stuff that's

549
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,919
great but really when it comes to

550
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,559
percentages and stuff like that I think

551
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,720
that there needs to be standardization

552
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,399
it should be run by the government yeah

553
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,759
um and I get a little bit of hate for

554
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,559
that but I feel like that's the one

555
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,798
thing where we need to take away

556
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,720
anything that incentivizes people to lie

557
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:45,720
about the results right because

558
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,798
everybody wants a leg up on their compet

559
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,960
competition absolutely I mean I feel the

560
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,720
same way because you know as a breeder

561
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,840
it's actually seriously inconvenient to

562
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,960
you know have Labs falsifying numbers

563
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:00,558
essentially like I've straight up had

564
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,360
Labs call us and be like well what THC

565
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,158
percentage were you expecting to get on

566
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,759
this like what do you want basically and

567
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,600
we're like we want you to tell us what

568
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:13,119
it is they're like okay it's going to be

569
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,079
an extra week we were like um that's

570
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,879
kind of concerning we're pivoting to do

571
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,558
everything inhouse for that I mean we

572
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,159
will have third party testing as well

573
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,158
but like I feel like in-house is the

574
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,120
best uh because then you can get results

575
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,960
as fast you need it yeah exactly and you

576
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,759
can have a consistent method to be

577
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,360
honest because even just things as

578
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,158
simple as adjusting your moisture

579
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,000
content when you're running the liquid

580
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,720
chromatograph is going to change your

581
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,720
totally excuse it yeah the drier it is

582
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,600
the higher the results we used to have a

583
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,319
orange photonics that we used quite

584
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,959
often and that was just one of the first

585
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:46,918
things we noticed was like you know it's

586
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,120
so easy to skew your results just with

587
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,360
the tiniest little changes on that thing

588
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,038
right it's kind of inevitable that like

589
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,719
there is always going to be a desire to

590
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:59,079
get higher numbers but I I do agree that

591
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,640
I think it it needs to be it to be more

592
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,759
heavily regulated the only way at this

593
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,840
point like I feel comfortable with any

594
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,599
data we collect is if we're running it

595
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,359
ourselves or making sure that it's done

596
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,399
the exact same way with the exact same

597
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,079
moisture content every single time you

598
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,480
know there's so many variables that you

599
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,839
have to keep track of in that situation

600
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,079
well and it's like it makes it so hard

601
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,918
to go from state to state doing it the

602
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,439
right way in metric going from state to

603
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,038
state because all these labs are so

604
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,038
different and how they get test results

605
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,720
are not only how they get test results

606
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,278
but how they prep the samples and where

607
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,360
they get the samples some states you

608
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,278
give them the flower others the

609
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,599
California they pick it from a batch and

610
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:39,880
it's just there's no consistency across

611
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,439
the board and it's just it's kind of a

612
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,640
joke yeah well I mean I've even noticed

613
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,759
things like different test results on

614
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,080
the same Branch but it's just a

615
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:52,278
different butt like so it really is hard

616
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,678
to pinpoint and you know you see out R

617
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,159
of stuff these days like you I've heard

618
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:00,480
outrageous numbers multiple times now

619
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:04,240
it's like 45 50% THC and I'm like

620
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,159
wouldn't that melt like it wouldn't even

621
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,720
be a solid butt at that point it would

622
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,919
just mus right well maybe it's because

623
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,720
somebody uh put a whole bunch of ke on

624
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,400
the pl that's like that's another

625
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,159
classic one I've heard of as people are

626
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,278
just you know rolling their butt in some

627
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,799
key FR before they send it in so yeah I

628
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:23,759
mean I remember the hash they tested in

629
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,759
the 40s not only 10 years ago something

630
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,919
like that and it was like 40% hash and

631
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,119
now they say there's 50% flour it's like

632
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,640
there's

633
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,399
yeah it's crazy I'm like the math ain't

634
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,400
math and all that no and there's so much

635
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,798
stuff like that so when you're doing

636
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,840
your field runs and you guys are are

637
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,480
smelling plants do you smell the side

638
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,439
branches or the top branches I think

639
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,278
everybody's different I prefer the side

640
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,000
I like to do like a little bit of both

641
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,679
to be honest but yeah generally I'll go

642
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,440
for the it depends on how tall the plan

643
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,200
is to be honest but I generally up going

644
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,880
for the the 12 Footers you're probably

645
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,640
not going for the the center cor

646
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,520
definitely no tops in that situation and

647
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,038
as much as smell is like one of the

648
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,599
number one things we're looking for in

649
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,839
that situation there's also so many

650
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,839
other variables that we're looking at so

651
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,079
right when it comes down to it it's like

652
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,278
you can kind of you know once you're

653
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,639
walking through you can kind of

654
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:17,278
eliminate a few things just

655
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,038
automatically by walking by you're like

656
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,880
that one has [ __ ] structure it's doing

657
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,079
weird stuff like get molded early

658
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,440
whatever it is you're eliminating a few

659
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,439
things as you go and you know then you

660
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,640
walk up to one that is kind of just a

661
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,159
jaw-dropper and that's like you know

662
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,038
that's what I like to call the Unicorn

663
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,360
plants and you know that's when you

664
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,599
actually look deeper into it and start

665
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,519
taking data so I'm all up in that [ __ ]

666
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,038
when it comes down to those ones it's

667
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,879
like once I find the one we're sitting

668
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:46,119
there I'm you know evaluating its

669
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,600
structure I'm evaluating the triome

670
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:51,239
density I'm evaluating you know turpine

671
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,599
strength of course uh mold resistance

672
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,640
there's there's a lot of different

673
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,639
factors for sure so yeah it's a labor of

674
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,880
love but I would like to say that I

675
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,480
probably smell top to bottom when it

676
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,240
comes down to a really good one right

677
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,200
it's all about those unicorns and doing

678
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,919
pheno hunts that big you actually really

679
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,720
do get to see a lot of unicorns it's

680
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,440
like when you yeah pop 100 seeds and you

681
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,038
get that 1% but if you're going for that

682
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,640
1% of 10,000 that's 100 plants there's

683
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:21,240
100 special things out there because I

684
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,880
feel like most of the time you're going

685
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,599
to find 1% that's really good and uh but

686
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,640
but I'm good I'm good with smaller hunts

687
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,119
too I really like especially if I know

688
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,278
my lines and I kind of know the

689
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,959
direction I'm going for I could pop 20

690
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:35,480
seeds of something if I know what I'm

691
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,079
looking for that I've made before and

692
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm like okay well what I'm looking for

693
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,720
is going to be found in probably at 20

694
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,959
to 30 yeah sometimes more sometimes less

695
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,159
but it's just depending on how well you

696
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,278
know your lines right absolutely I

697
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,360
definitely agree with that one and you

698
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,319
know yeah for us it's really with pheno

699
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,398
hunting it's we're looking for something

700
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,960
that's just a total anomaly and you know

701
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,678
a lot of the time it isn't a perfect

702
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,319
representation of a combination of the

703
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,320
parents it's something that went way off

704
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,278
in a different track

705
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,240
recessive that's what makes it special

706
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,960
that's what makes it exciting and that's

707
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,519
one thing I always have to remind our

708
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,720
crews that we phenoh hunt with is I'm

709
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,038
like please do not rate every PL yeah

710
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,399
you know I you need to use your better

711
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,839
judgment a little bit here and the

712
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,719
process of elimination and you know kind

713
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,798
of pick and shoes as you go because not

714
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,038
every single one out of this field of

715
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,519
2,000 plants deserves to get written up

716
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,679
yeah I mean there's so that's so much

717
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,200
work there's so much work that goes into

718
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,960
working on that many plants and having

719
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,278
them grown correctly and like with

720
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,480
indoor it's easy to grow them out

721
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,440
multiple times to try to get similar

722
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,759
results but with the outdoor it's like

723
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,000
you can grow them but it takes a whole

724
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,200
another year I guess if you're depping

725
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,599
them it's a little different too you

726
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,720
could do multiple I mean what we usually

727
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,678
do is we'll you know do the big Mega

728
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,278
outdoor hunt and then we take our

729
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,720
winners and you know we're actually just

730
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,960
starting this process right now from

731
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,319
this last year but uh you know we have

732
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,240
them in Clone form they're like this big

733
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,839
at the point that we found the winners

734
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,558
and so then you know we finally get a

735
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:11,359
couple cuts off of them essentially and

736
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:14,038
we flower those out indoor just to do

737
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:17,158
the second process of you know seeing if

738
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,319
they actually work out uh right it's

739
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,840
it's a totally different environment and

740
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:22,759
you know there can also just be

741
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,839
different Expressions totally different

742
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:26,640
expression sometimes yeah better or

743
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,959
worse you just you kind of have to see

744
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,640
you kind of have to see all angles at

745
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,640
this Point like my preference is to you

746
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,480
know do outdoor mixl dep indoor all of

747
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,240
it and we normally do all of that R

748
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,880
before we ever even release it to the

749
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,919
public so yeah it's there's a lot more

750
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,000
that goes into it than just going out

751
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,120
there and picking a plan being like this

752
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
is the one I mean sometimes I wish it

753
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,038
was that simple but then it wouldn't be

754
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,079
as fun right totally so I'd heard of

755
00:27:53,038 --> 00:28:00,398
humble seeds uh heard of you guys for a

756
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:03,319
long time but then the first time I ran

757
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,439
any of your gear was blueberry muffin

758
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,439
and it was a special plant it was I was

759
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,480
given blueberry muffin uh from someone

760
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,000
in Sacramento as DJ shorts blueberry and

761
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,159
I grew it out and I'm like this is not

762
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,240
dj this is way different this there's no

763
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,000
way it's funny people always ask us if

764
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,000
it's crossed with his and we're like if

765
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,440
you know his blueberry then you know

766
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,679
this it's nothing and it's like it's an

767
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,759
amazing plant and I did some breeding

768
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,000
with it too but that was like I was like

769
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,558
well you guys are on to something with

770
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,079
that that was really special that one

771
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,359
was a really special one it was one of

772
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,439
those like like I said just anomaly

773
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:41,158
plants it was I you know it was way back

774
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,320
when I think 2010 or something like that

775
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,200
and you know we were doing the big

776
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:47,678
outdoor grow and uh we had our whole

777
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,080
crew and our manager up there and a

778
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,679
bunch of the trimmers went up to harvest

779
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,639
and they literally like stopped dead

780
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,559
harvesting that one and we're like this

781
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,840
smells just like blueberry muffins like

782
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,440
we need to set this aside and sure

783
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:00,599
enough my dad fell in love with with it

784
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,640
it was it was a good one yeah it's got

785
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,000
its own thing it's the structure is

786
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,440
amazing too it's just the color the

787
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,679
structure the smell I mean the smoke

788
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,200
everything about it just it kind of

789
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,679
checks all the boxes and it's a good

790
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,880
breeder too I I feel that way too but

791
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,919
you know that one's nostalgic strain for

792
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,399
me I always say it's kind of my favorite

793
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,278
but it's it's like probably the first

794
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:24,479
thing I ever smoked I grew up just even

795
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:27,200
smelling it just around the house or in

796
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,599
the dry rooms and whatnot so to me that

797
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
one defin

798
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,398
always has a special place in my heart

799
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,038
yeah it's another one that you smoke a

800
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,719
joint of it it translates all the way

801
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,119
through the smoke and it's like that not

802
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,519
a lot of stuff does that there's a

803
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,199
handful of things out there that do but

804
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,278
that's definitely one of them no it's

805
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,200
crazy I mean it's like it hits your

806
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:47,558
tongue and sometimes I'm like like was

807
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,159
that even weed like it tastes like

808
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:50,079
you're eating a blueberry muffin it's a

809
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,480
dessert

810
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,439
yeah feel it in your throat like it's

811
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,319
just this creamy like sweetness it's

812
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,720
yeah it's a good one it's a good one for

813
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,359
sure yeah and so you guys have crossed

814
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,159
and made lines out of that and done some

815
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,199
breeding work with that I think some of

816
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,240
your new stuff that even has that in it

817
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,759
is one of the parents and we we

818
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,720
definitely have played a lot with the

819
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,839
blueberry muffin it's one that we get a

820
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,038
lot of demand for so you know we have

821
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,839
our blueberry cupcake which is kind of

822
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:21,640
like the new rendition of it um

823
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,480
blueberry muffin times wedding cake yeah

824
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,278
so it kind of just has that like bag

825
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,399
appeal Frost layer didn't really add any

826
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:30,720
new derps maybe a little bit of you know

827
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,278
bre cakiness but it's tough though when

828
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,278
you have something that that's that

829
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:36,480
profound and that's that different kind

830
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:40,519
of like how skittles it is kind of like

831
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,759
how skittles basically Skittles is the

832
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,679
AP Apex of that but then when you look

833
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,278
at the crosses the S1 and the the

834
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,320
Skittles crosses there anything really

835
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,200
better than Skittles has Skittles in it

836
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,720
it's like it's you know there's people

837
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,200
that'll argue this and that but like

838
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,278
really Skittles is the one yeah I mean I

839
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,038
I have to absolutely agree there I think

840
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:02,200
you know there's there's no point in

841
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:04,158
chasing the hype train especially in the

842
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,919
breeding world anymore at this point

843
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,240
it's it's so like constantly changing

844
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,159
and you know it's it's unpredictable

845
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,079
it's an unpredictable market and so I I

846
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,200
personally think you know for us we just

847
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,558
like to stick to what we know right and

848
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,759
the classic blueberry muffin is is the

849
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:27,278
one that I know and love right so yeah I

850
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:29,038
don't think I don't think a blueberry

851
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,278
cupcake or any of the new crosses are

852
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:34,679
ever going to change my opinion on that

853
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,440
that yeah totally yeah I feel like yeah

854
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,840
especially with something so nostalgic

855
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,120
it absolutely is I mean like I can I

856
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:43,240
know I'll smell the bag from [ __ ] 50

857
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,359
feet away and I'm like I'm like that's

858
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,359
the MU there it is right or you know we

859
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:50,119
just we just harvested our seed chamber

860
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,959
of it and you know I wasn't actually

861
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,839
even there for the Harvest and I went to

862
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,840
go close up the dry dry shed container

863
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,278
and I immediately as soon as I open the

864
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,038
door I'm like blueberry muffin yeah

865
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,599
totally I'm sure rosin I I don't think

866
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,798
I've smoked any blueberry muffin rosin

867
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,398
but I bet you it tastes amazing it

868
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:11,000
tastes great but it it's not a good

869
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,319
yielder to be honest it's you know some

870
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,159
of the best ones aren't like I mean

871
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,200
Skittles doesn't yield well Skittles

872
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,000
yields okay but Skittles is super high

873
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,399
in it's decent for rosin washes like

874
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,599
[ __ ] yeah be honest but but you know

875
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,398
there's a lot of people who still do it

876
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:29,398
because it's so worth it for that her

877
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:32,079
profile it's just like you know it's

878
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,398
uncanny muffin smell just yeah well it's

879
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,918
like Skittles R and people do stuff that

880
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,359
yields twice or three times as much but

881
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,600
you know sometimes it's worth it just

882
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,000
for that flavor oh yeah no I I love the

883
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:44,319
Skittles it's honestly I I was super

884
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,038
stoked when you said that that's what

885
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,319
you had to sample today because that's

886
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:50,119
one of if I had to pick a favorite that

887
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,960
isn't a humble Seed Company strain I

888
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:54,239
think that'd be one of my top ones nice

889
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,519
yeah there's something special about

890
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,759
Skittles and it's like it's the flavor

891
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,319
it's the the effect I feel like it's

892
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:04,079
lighter on the effect and sometimes I

893
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:06,119
like stronger sometimes I like more

894
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,879
sativa leaning stuff but Skittles has

895
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,839
its own thing and I enjoy smoking really

896
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,840
good Skittles there's just yeah it's

897
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,519
like one thing it's in the Arsenal and

898
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,959
I'm always when I get a fresh bag of it

899
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,720
I smoke it till it's not fresh anymore

900
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,360
and then I'll move on to something but

901
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,519
like it's real easy to just smoke joints

902
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,558
of Skittles all day absolutely so you

903
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,120
want to taste the first one yeah let's

904
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,960
do it what we have here is two different

905
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,798
joints that I've rolled up they were

906
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,159
grown in the same environment with

907
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,599
everything the same except for the

908
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,919
substrate we have one that was grown

909
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,439
with soil and one that was grown with

910
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,080
cocoa and so we're going to do a trial

911
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,399
here to see which one you

912
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,839
prefer um I don't get to know which

913
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:46,678
one's which yet not yet

914
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:50,720
okay that would ruin the

915
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,720
test but yeah I'm I'm curious is to see

916
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,120
if you get the same results that I got

917
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,798
yesterday and you know I get excited

918
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,798
about stuff but

919
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,760
off for do be here yeah so we've been

920
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,039
R&amp;D because we're going in metric with

921
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,320
joints next year and so we've been r&amp;

922
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:18,838
ding a whole bunch of different styles

923
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,000
machine rolled versus hand rolled I like

924
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:26,199
the hand rolled the best but as far as

925
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,480
convenience um and cost it's tough but I

926
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,319
it's got to smoke it's got to check all

927
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,000
the boxes and it's like there's so many

928
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,000
different sizes different tips different

929
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,878
papers all these different things that

930
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,918
you can do to make a good product and at

931
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,918
the end of the day we want the best

932
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,918
product out there yeah and so research

933
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,918
development

934
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,439
yeah it's so much more than just having

935
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,440
good flour when you have a product like

936
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,119
a pre-roll but I feel like convenience

937
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,200
is the future pretty tasty right it's

938
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,640
really

939
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,679
tasty I like

940
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,480
that there's so many different things

941
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,159
that you can do to change it like you

942
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,960
can change the diameter you can go from

943
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:11,000
a 10 mL to a 12 M millimet 10 10 mm to a

944
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,920
12 mimer and using the same paper and

945
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,159
same crutch everything and it burns

946
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,200
hotter with the bigger millimeter like

947
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,358
significantly to to where you can taste

948
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,919
more turps if it's a little bit thinner

949
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,480
and before I like these big monster

950
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,320
joints I like the three and a half grams

951
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,440
and that's cool but as far as like if

952
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,760
you're going for for tur

953
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,240
like this the smaller not necessar when

954
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,960
is this is perfect and then it gets

955
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,479
smaller than this and it's not as tury

956
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,280
so got to find that perfect Middle

957
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,358
Ground I mean that that hit really nice

958
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,400
I have to

959
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,799
say honestly it's good work it's you

960
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,920
know it's come time that we actually

961
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,920
start doing like serious comparative

962
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,800
analysis and real R&amp;D you know cuz

963
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,639
before it's like everyone has their

964
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,280
theories and they're like this is the

965
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,039
way but Bro Science Bro Science so much

966
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,960
Pro science out there but you know

967
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:04,079
that's that's one thing I have like

968
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,480
actually been you know enjoying lately

969
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,640
is seeing uh you know people put the

970
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,920
proof in the pudding I think is the

971
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:14,519
phrase yeah and I mean it takes a lot of

972
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,440
effort and time and a significant amount

973
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,480
of money to do proper R&amp;D and a lot of

974
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,039
people don't understand that what

975
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,719
exactly goes into a good product and it

976
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,119
takes a lot of time and energy and a lot

977
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:28,239
of passion and sometimes you have to put

978
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,880
out a lot of money before you get any

979
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,000
return on that money yeah and uh but

980
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,480
you're doing it because you want the

981
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,400
best product absolutely yeah I mean we

982
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,159
get that aot just even with strain

983
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,599
releases people see us do a feno hunt

984
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:44,239
and they're like can I get it now and

985
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,000
we're like give give us three or four

986
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,399
seriously and then there's companies

987
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,199
that put out 400 new crosses a year and

988
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,119
it's like they're not doing the R&amp;D on

989
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,199
it it's like we make we make 300

990
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,318
outcrosses a year but we probably only

991
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,399
release 50 maybe the most

992
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,159
and that's on a that's usually a

993
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,680
combined effort of multiple years of

994
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,159
breathing where we're like okay we've

995
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,199
tested this out we've tested this out we

996
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,318
like this and this but uh you know it's

997
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,960
like and there's so many different

998
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:14,199
companies and different models and I

999
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,159
think there's no one way to do

1000
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,480
it but uh I mean there's the right way

1001
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,759
but what the right way is for each

1002
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,400
person is so different right well I mean

1003
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,960
I always make the comparison when it

1004
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,639
comes to breeding and you know strain

1005
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,838
development you would think of breeding

1006
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,279
dogs for an example like you know you're

1007
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:34,838
not going to

1008
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,119
cross two different breeds of dogs a

1009
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:40,039
poodle and a Pug together and you know

1010
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,559
immediately have super uniform babies

1011
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:45,199
you know perfect result and so like as

1012
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,400
much as you know I admire anybody who

1013
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:50,000
wants

1014
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,559
to do pollination projects and

1015
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,920
experiment with breeding and you know

1016
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,159
make their own stuff it's it's not in my

1017
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,400
opinion how the process should be

1018
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,719
carried out um no and we're we're

1019
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,039
working with unstable genetics so it's

1020
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,759
like we're already working with this mut

1021
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,279
for the most part right and so like

1022
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,119
exactly getting to a point where it's

1023
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,160
stable takes a lot of work and a lot of

1024
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:14,880
energy and you're getting rid of a lot

1025
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:16,639
of stuff to find the good stuff it's not

1026
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,559
like okay we cross these two things here

1027
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,598
you go and right that's kind of the

1028
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,559
model now but I don't see that being the

1029
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,559
model of the future I know your dad and

1030
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,119
you guys definitely don't see that as

1031
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,078
the model of the future because I feel

1032
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,200
like the I see from Instagram is you

1033
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:34,240
know you guys are putting in the real

1034
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:36,960
work I think you know it's been a timec

1035
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,598
consuming process I have to say and it's

1036
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,838
you know really special that my dad kind

1037
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:47,240
of saw that he had a passion in breeding

1038
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:50,159
and with it it started from him working

1039
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:52,159
in salmon genomics and right then he

1040
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,960
shifted into breeding his own cannabis

1041
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,559
cuz you know I mean this is an

1042
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,800
assumption but I think he was probably

1043
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,799
getting some unreliable genetics back

1044
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,960
then and he's like totally I have a

1045
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,079
gorilla grow to run and a family to feed

1046
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:08,039
all of a sudden and I need stable

1047
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:10,880
reliable seed right and you know that's

1048
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:13,079
what sparked the whole thing but it's

1049
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,000
also meant that we've had the ability to

1050
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,519
build our lies for a really long time

1051
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,079
and uh so you know stability is

1052
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:23,599
obviously an important thing for us but

1053
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:27,440
you I think that's just generally the

1054
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,880
expectation of you know an advanced

1055
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,838
breeding company is like I don't I don't

1056
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,800
buy corn from the grocery and neither

1057
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:36,559
expect it to be you know five different

1058
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,079
kinds and different colors and one's

1059
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,799
sweet and one tastes like water the corn

1060
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,000
is it's the worst because it's like we

1061
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,400
have two types of corn now that are

1062
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,800
available in grocery stores pretty much

1063
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,318
yet there's so many different types of

1064
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,280
corn out there in

1065
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:58,358
existence um but accessibility it's

1066
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:02,000
another one trying to think here

1067
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:05,039
both are good you yeah feel free to test

1068
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,358
them as many times as you'd

1069
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,920
like and so your dad got some grants

1070
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:12,199
right he was one of the first people

1071
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,800
I've heard of that got some grants to do

1072
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:15,799
uh I think research and

1073
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:25,358
development not in cannabis not for fish

1074
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:27,079
maybe for fish yeah yeah um yeah he was

1075
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:31,000
always really passionate about Salon

1076
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:33,200
Pres reservation and um that's kind of

1077
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,639
what I grew up with his you know

1078
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:39,358
official job being was the uh he was the

1079
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,318
director for the Salmon River

1080
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,719
restoration Council for a while and he

1081
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,920
wrote a bunch of Grants while he was

1082
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:49,000
there nice and so yeah he's he's always

1083
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,318
been really really really passionate

1084
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,039
about that and we just recently also had

1085
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:57,119
the The Wonder of seeing the clth dams

1086
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,838
be taken out which was like what I kind

1087
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,119
of grew up with him fighting for it

1088
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,759
constantly it was it was a huge part of

1089
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,039
my childhood and we would go to all the

1090
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,160
little process at Pacific cor and you

1091
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:13,559
know hold algae up and I had my like

1092
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:14,960
fish puppet that I to around and uh I

1093
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,920
lost my train of thought I'm already

1094
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,559
stoned this shit's it's pretty good this

1095
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,720
shit's smacking

1096
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,400
so as far as preference which one did

1097
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,039
you like the the better Taste of I guess

1098
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,119
is the effect now we've smoked both of

1099
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:31,880
them it's hard to say yeah M I think I

1100
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,200
like the first one 100% yeah I'm right

1101
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,559
there with you the first one is soil

1102
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,799
grown it's soil it's it's almost like

1103
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:40,318
perfumey like it's it's Skittles but

1104
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,079
it's like it's like two levels higher

1105
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,519
than the cocoa as far as the flavor like

1106
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,200
it's still got the candy and everything

1107
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,199
but it almost has like this

1108
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,280
perfume yeah it's got this perfume

1109
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,800
flavor it's really really nice I was

1110
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,880
hoping I pick the soil one I have to say

1111
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,079
so yeah yeah I really like that actually

1112
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,280
I mean these are the kind of tests that

1113
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,000
everybody should be doing you know I

1114
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,440
think I do like cocoa don't get me wrong

1115
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,400
I do smoke a lot of cocoa but like

1116
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,159
seeing Skittles like this is really it's

1117
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,920
it's almost obvious not even almost it's

1118
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:17,159
to me that's pretty obvious that soil

1119
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,119
makes a better product as far as I did

1120
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,440
the effect test so I smoked them a few

1121
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,440
hours apart okay and then I smoked them

1122
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,480
a few hours apart again and I was like

1123
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,039
okay the soil definitely has a stronger

1124
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,679
effect but wasn't like as much of a come

1125
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,199
down and crash either I felt like it

1126
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:33,919
lifts you up and then it makes you feel

1127
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,639
really good and then you just go down

1128
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,720
gentle whereas like the effect from the

1129
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:40,838
other one I felt like I smoked it a

1130
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:42,679
bunch and it wasn't as strong but it I

1131
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,318
definitely felt it after I hadn't smoked

1132
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:48,358
for like 30 minutes one of them or both

1133
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:52,199
of them it's doing the trick yeah nice

1134
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:55,480
definitely got me stoned so coming from

1135
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,879
Humble did you go to college um I I mean

1136
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,440
I kind of just messed around and took

1137
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,760
some classes it was like right as

1138
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,039
legalization kind of hit and so I was in

1139
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,200
school for business at the time and I

1140
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:11,960
was working with my dad also pretty

1141
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,838
consistently like basically full-time

1142
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,720
and at got to the point where I was just

1143
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:19,199
like I'm learning like five times more

1144
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,879
working like Hands-On with my dad every

1145
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:24,558
day you know ended up just kind of going

1146
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,119
with that route instead right and uh you

1147
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,280
know it was obviously what I wanted to

1148
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,480
do as well I just wasn't

1149
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,040
necessarily what I imagined doing right

1150
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,760
when I graduated high school it was

1151
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:38,239
always kind of our like lowkey you know

1152
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,400
MH it was uh you know it was like a

1153
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:44,159
little side business and next thing you

1154
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,200
know it was like our whole entire

1155
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,879
reality yeah it's pretty wild that you

1156
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,519
know from 2018 to now where it went from

1157
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,240
recreational

1158
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:57,960
to today it's changed so much the

1159
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:02,719
industry even you know we had had lack

1160
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:05,000
of stability maybe from 23 2013 to 2018

1161
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:07,598
as well but it was very different yeah I

1162
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,480
mean it's been a wild ride for me

1163
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,599
definitely like I didn't ever really

1164
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,719
imagine that it was going to go in this

1165
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:20,200
direction and you know um for our brand

1166
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,199
to have made it this far it's kind of

1167
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:24,118
mind-blowing you guys have had seeds in

1168
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:27,318
smoke shops and you guys have kind of

1169
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,519

00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:04,199
in these like new areas that haven't

1185
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,199
necessarily like experienced the world

1186
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:08,598
of cannabis as we know it today in

1187
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:11,799
California and they're all just you know

1188
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:14,559
so genuine and excited enthusiastic

1189
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,000
and they're not jaded yet you know like

1190
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,400
like the people here I feel like

1191
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,920
everybody's a little Jaded by the

1192
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,599
industry and over there I mean I go to

1193
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,639
Mexico I'm going to St Vincent like I go

1194
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:27,480
to the Caribbean with Marlon Asher who I

1195
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,440
think the I met you the first time

1196
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,880
actually was it backstage at a slightly

1197
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,240
stupid show yeah and I can't remember

1198
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,240
which one but uh yeah so we have Marlon

1199
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,799
he was performing with them Marlon's a

1200
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,799
great guy and uh we're going to the

1201
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,079
Caribbean on Friday to gift the country

1202
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,200
seeds so the minister of Agriculture

1203
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,640
letting us import seeds into the country

1204
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,639
and we're going to go gift them to the

1205
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:53,558
people we made some crosses in 20189

1206
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,799
20120 and 21 and I did some banana

1207
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,240
crosses a while back and so we brought

1208
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,519
those for the island and it should a lot

1209
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:03,000
of fun that's incredible that's going to

1210
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:05,358
be a really exciting trip yeah yeah I

1211
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,880
definitely feel like times are really

1212
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,920
changing and like having situations like

1213
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,838
that happening is something I never

1214
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,880
would have imagined as a little kid that

1215
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,759
was like you know scared to talk about

1216
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,640
totally the government is very like

1217
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,520
supportive of cannabis there which is so

1218
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,279
different than here because I feel like

1219
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,679
here we're just kind of a thorn in the

1220
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,880
side of the government the whole

1221
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,719
industry and over there the the

1222
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,838
government has the can Authority and

1223
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,358
they're like how can we help our people

1224
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:33,719
and make our people better how can we

1225
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,159
use this plant as medicine it's medical

1226
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:36,639
over there so they they look at it from

1227
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,159
a medicinal standpoint but there's

1228
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,639
really passionate people and it's just

1229
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:44,879
so different than the government here in

1230
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:47,000
that regard yeah I know it's it's

1231
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,599
interesting like the approach that but

1232
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,920
you know it's the American way I guess

1233
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,160
this industry for profit and that's it

1234
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,480
right there's so much energy out there

1235
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,239
in the world with for cannabis and the

1236
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,240
really special thing about seeds is just

1237
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,598
seeing how they travel like that and the

1238
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,039
way that you can have a seed come from

1239
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:07,119
you know Northern California and go

1240
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,358
change somebody's life in a totally

1241
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,200
different place yeah it's pretty amazing

1242
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,639
yeah you know you have one big plant

1243
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:16,480
that has 10,000 seeds on it and where

1244
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:18,358
those seeds go and how much you know

1245
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,400
right that changes the world I feel like

1246
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,000
cannabis makes the world a better place

1247
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,280
and so and making seeds you're doing

1248
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,559
that exponentially which is uh pretty

1249
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,519
wild when you like really dive into it

1250
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:33,040
definitely mindblowing to me I still

1251
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:35,719
constantly uh have to second guess and

1252
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,039
questioned like if it's all even real

1253
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,078
because places I've never even dreamed

1254
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,400
of that I'm seeing people growing our

1255
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,240
seeds and you know totally it's amazing

1256
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,720
how it brings everybody together like it

1257
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,879
you can be totally the other end of the

1258
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,439
spectrum from whatever and you know you

1259
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,838
can like heavy metal music or Grateful

1260
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,838
Dead music and you both like weed and

1261
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,920
you can get along real easily that's

1262
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,920
very

1263
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,200
true I mean it just brings it's it's

1264
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,559
like kind of like food is like that too

1265
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:04,318
how it just brings people together I

1266
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,920
know I have a big passion for combining

1267
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,239
weed and food it's like two of my

1268
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,318
favorite things and I think it is

1269
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:11,959
because it's like such you know it's

1270
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:13,920
similar Vibes that it really just draws

1271
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,039
everyone together you're you're not

1272
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,519
focused on the other [ __ ] for just a

1273
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:21,279
second you're just stoned and having a

1274
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:23,639
good night they both make people happy

1275
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,400
right yeah I'm I'm right there with you

1276
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:28,838
although I'm not really big on putting

1277
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,680
cannabis in my I like smoking and I like

1278
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:33,199
eating and I like keeping them separate

1279
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:35,759
you know I was a chef and I really love

1280
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,639
food and I love cannabis but together

1281
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,160
it's like you know I grew up eating

1282
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:41,879
brownies and drinking crazy drinks that

1283
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,879
had cannabis in that were super strong

1284
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,920
but for me it's like I always been like

1285
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,519
you eat it and then it makes you feel

1286
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,519
high an hour later an hour and a half

1287
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,358
later I like enjoying the food with my

1288
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:55,440
cannabis yeah I definitely kind of have

1289
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:57,440
to agree with you on that one I never

1290
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,599
been like the big edible person I don't

1291
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,760
know what it is about me but I can't

1292
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,240
even get high off of them so you eat a

1293
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,400
whole bunch you don't get high I've I've

1294
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:08,118
tried like so many times I really

1295
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,400
genuinely have and I I heard it's like

1296
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:13,760
some digestive enzyme potentially there

1297
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,519
was some report that came out I I don't

1298
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,200
know what it is but you're not the first

1299
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,880
person so K from triome Technologies

1300
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:25,000
he's another amazing breeder SL extract

1301
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,640
artist SL the guy who the reason they do

1302
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
the extraction they do or the we as a

1303
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:31,558
society and as a community the reason we

1304
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,318
do it the way we do it today is from K

1305
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,559
from Tricom Technologies and his wife

1306
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:38,798
same thing she uh could eat a th000

1307
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:40,319
milligrams nothing yeah well I realized

1308
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:42,559
there was something definitely wrong

1309
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,759
when I like started recommending stuff

1310
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,720
to friends and I was like oh it's really

1311
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,599
mellow like you'll be fine I ate two

1312
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,358
last night and she like ended up having

1313
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,119
an entire panic attack and got just so

1314
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:57,480
high and you know this is a girl that

1315
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:59,760
smokes a lot so like I there's

1316
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,639
definitely something a little wrong here

1317
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,079
our body chemistries are all so uniquely

1318
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:05,598
different it's amazing how Edibles can

1319
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,720
affect people so differently and then

1320
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,519
you can like for me I can smoke all day

1321
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:12,838
long and then go eat an edible and I'm

1322
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,639
toast from 20 milligrams yeah so and

1323
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:16,719
then other people 500 milligrams I've

1324
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,480
seen people have bad trips on 500

1325
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:22,239
milligrams too yeah I mean some people

1326
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,920
get really messed up off of them i' I've

1327
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,959
never had the experience I'm like

1328
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,079
honestly a little curious yes I don't

1329
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,960
know I've never felt like so high that

1330
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:33,000
I'm like really unhappy about it right

1331
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,838
yeah you just have to eat a whole bunch

1332
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,599
of mushrooms and do a whole bunch of

1333
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:38,639
caffeine with it and maybe that there

1334
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,000
you

1335
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:43,480
comparable but yeah it's so mushrooms

1336
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,760
affect you though yes definitely that

1337
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,400
would that would be a bummer if

1338
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,680
mushrooms didn't affect me yeah I feel

1339
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,480
you that would be a rough one yeah I

1340
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,719
don't know what it is about Edibles that

1341
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,159
just they've never like really fully

1342
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,439
transpired and I've had multiple times

1343
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:58,558
where I've like eaten them with people

1344
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,039
and they're freaking the [ __ ] out and

1345
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,319
you know so i' I've definitely come to

1346
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,798
the conclusion that there's something

1347
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:08,239
wrong body chemistry yeah you've just

1348
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:09,519
been exposed to it so much for so long

1349
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,598
that it just doesn't get you anymore

1350
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,759
that's what well that's what I wonder

1351
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,440
I'm like hm like did I did I eat too

1352
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,200
many Edibles when I was a child or

1353
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,599
something like right not a child but you

1354
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,039
know high school days sure but being

1355
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,640
around cannabis all the time you know

1356
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,239
it's like you were exposed to it from a

1357
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:28,440
very young age and I started smoking

1358
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:30,558
when I was 14

1359
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,679
and right away I knew that was it was

1360
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,480
the one like it changed my life yeah

1361
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:36,759
you're like I'll stick with this I tried

1362
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,960
psychedelics first because I was scared

1363
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,240
to smoke because I ran cross country in

1364
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,358
high school and I was really bad and so

1365
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:46,039
I I tried acid first and the Bay Area we

1366
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:47,838
have really good stuff but then once I

1367
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,880
finally tried canvas I'm like this is

1368
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,759
this is the stuff this is the one yeah

1369
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,240
that's kind of how it went for me too I

1370
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,960
was like okay I know what I'm going to

1371
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,879
stick to I've always been like a more of

1372
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:05,480
a I like it my drugs to be grown in the

1373
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:07,280
ground kind of a person raw form uh so

1374
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,480
yeah the shrooms and the and the weed

1375
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,760
were like the

1376
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,519
personal I don't know combination of

1377
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,200
probably forever for me yeah it's a good

1378
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:21,318
combo too and I feel like you know

1379
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:22,439
mushrooms I don't I don't eat mushrooms

1380
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:23,920
all the time but I go through waves

1381
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,159
where I eat them more often than other

1382
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,200
times and now people are micro doing

1383
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,358
stuff and I feel like that's just that's

1384
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,960
great we never micro do back in the day

1385
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:35,679
it was always like an eighth or a half

1386
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:38,480
an eighth yeah I haven't done anything

1387
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,239
like that in a long time but yeah feel

1388
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,639
like I feel like I'm more cool with the

1389
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:44,598
micro doing like yeah a little more

1390
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,519

00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,880
new areas and you know there tends

1427
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:16,719
to be kind of a calling for us now and

1428
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,358
especially in like you know places near

1429
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,118
Europe Germany kind of immediately kind

1430
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:23,480
of took off and knew who we were so that

1431
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,640
was really cool to just be able to you

1432
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,760
know go in there and actually get the

1433
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,239
seeds they've been wanting it's it's a

1434
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,839
really special thing Macedonia is

1435
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:36,000
popping off now I didn't even hear about

Macedonia I mean there's all these

1438
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,399
countries going online it's really

1439
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,000
impressive I know well I think it's

1440
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,639
going to be like you know pretty Global

1441
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,639
eventually and that's just a whole

1442
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:51,000
another ballpark I don't Asia is going

1443
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,798
to be tricky so I'm curious about how

1444
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,639
Asia does it I'm excited for it all at

1445
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,519
the same time and then India we got some

1446
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:59,920
seeds we're we're basically testing a

1447
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,719
bunch of genetics from India so I'm

1448
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,798
excited about that cool that's the other

1449
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:05,679
like fun part about you know going to

1450
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:07,559
these different areas is just seeing how

1451
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,960
they cultivate and like what they've had

1452
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:12,960
going on you know up until now and I

1453
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:17,159
feel like California kind of always does

1454
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,559
retain like a major Market influence um

1455
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:22,078
you know whether we're leading it in a

1456
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:25,760
good direction is serious question but

1457
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:28,359
it is definitely like the kind of you

1458
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,520
know INSP Iration and starting point for

1459
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:33,519
any friends in the industry it's all the

1460
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,519
modern stuff well I shouldn't say that

1461
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,199
there's going to be people that from

1462
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:38,960
other places that have definitely had

1463
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:40,480
impact like West Coast California like

1464
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,838
you see that anywhere that they have

1465
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,519
cannabis and they know what you're

1466
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:47,519
talking about pretty much um maybe not

1467
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:50,358
all over India but a lot of places it's

1468
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,719
like C weed is the weed to get I feel

1469
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:55,199
like I mean it's everywhere it surprises

1470
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,838
me like we have you know people reaching

1471
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,078
out to us all the time from the most

1472
00:55:56,838 --> 00:56:01,599
random places and they they like know

1473
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:05,160
the top 10 strains in California and

1474
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,480
we're like okay like I mean it is where

1475
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:09,759
the best stuff originated and not to

1476
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,318
tutor on horn too much but right you

1477
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,720
know it's it's I think it's earned

1478
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:18,239
recognition yeah it's wild how social

1479
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:20,038
media and things like Facebook and

1480
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:22,279
Instagram have really had an impact on

1481
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:24,119
our industry too because people are able

1482
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,798
to see stuff from all over the world and

1483
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,960
they're they're able to get influenced

1484
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:30,280
by stuff so heavily where it's at the

1485
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,519
the the phone the push of a finger

1486
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,839
you're looking at different flower and

1487
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:36,798
different cultures and you know it's

1488
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:38,000
really open the doors it's good and bad

1489
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:39,639
but I think that's one of the good

1490
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,760
things is like people were able to see

1491
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:43,078
all these different things that people

1492
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:46,440
are doing yeah I know I think you know

1493
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:49,000
it's it's been revolutionary for us it's

1494
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:52,760
it's interesting just you know having a

1495
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,318
brand that was 100% word of mouth and

1496
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,599
you know like very under wraps and then

1497
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:59,119
you know going and being able to

1498
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:03,480
actually talk about it has like made the

1499
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:05,838
world of a difference you know uh and I

1500
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,358
definitely I definitely am just grateful

1501
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:11,038
to have been able to you know see my dad

1502
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,598
take like all of his projects and

1503
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:17,160
actually be able to share them with the

1504
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:19,160
world because you know he he's a humble

1505
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,639
mellow guy and he just loves to just

1506
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:24,519
hang out on the farm and make seeds and

1507
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:26,879
you know if it wasn't for legalization

1508
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:29,159
happening at the time it did like he you

1509
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,640
know might just still be up there with

1510
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:36,159
absolutely no recognition whatsoever for

1511
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,358
you know the branch so it's it's so is

1512
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,440
that when you guys knew it was going to

1513
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:43,798
be a real business was like once uh

1514
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:46,838
recreational hit um no I mean he already

1515
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:50,318
had made a business license for it like

1516
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:52,759
way back it was you know he had the name

1517
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:56,519
written up as just a seed company for

1518
00:57:52,760 --> 00:58:00,880
vegetables wow in general um and like

1519
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:03,079
2001 wow so it was you know it was

1520
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,039
planned for a long time and then he got

1521
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:08,039
the you know domain a while later and

1522
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,760
you know never really did much with it

1523
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:14,520
online right um next thing you know

1524
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:17,920
legal legalization came after

1525
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:20,358
like just quite a while of him breeding

1526
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,358
for you know all the homies and a few

1527
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:25,838
different orders around like you know

1528
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,719
tiny little business card packages that

1529
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,719
we would would shrink wrap on with the

1530
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:33,679
little vial in it and it was it was good

1531
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:36,558
times it was classic but did you guys

1532
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:38,719
save a bunch of the original stuff we

1533
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,119
still have some little bits and pieces

1534
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,558
here and there we have a little display

1535
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:44,160
case in our office and we some pieces we

1536
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,960
lost we used to make this really cool

1537
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:48,318
calendar and we can't find it but

1538
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,159
someone will have one someone that's

1539
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,480
watching the show might even have one

1540
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,960
it's amazing how this show has come

1541
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,280
through with stuff like that but like

1542
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,159
yeah the original calendars my friends

1543
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,200
Josh my friend Josh Freeman from Roots

1544
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,838
and Harmony he bred the silverback

1545
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:04,679
gorilla and a bunch of other genetics

1546
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:06,358
back in the day and this string called

1547
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:08,078
the Ripple Plum that was amazing but he

1548
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:10,078
had this awesome calendar and I just

1549
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,640
found like those calendars were the best

1550
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,559
the weed calendars from you know 10 20

1551
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,400
years ago were all pretty amazing it was

1552
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,519
a fun one it was all these little

1553
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,400
pictures of different strains we had at

1554
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:22,440
the time and you know then there was a

1555
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,358
picture of my dad in the back in one

1556
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,920
year and he had a full mask over his

1557
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:30,400
face and he's trying to be all low key

1558
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,119
that was the way to do it back then it's

1559
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,639
like you know it was dangerous and you

1560
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,599
know you really couldn't show your face

1561
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:39,199
that much everyone had different names

1562
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,920
it was the reality you know there's a

1563
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:44,118
lot of bumps on the road potentially if

1564
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,599
you messed up at all and you know

1565
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:48,519
especially once that committed it's you

1566
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:50,880
know there's no going back like if you

1567
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:52,199
get if you get even just chopped one

1568
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,960
year it's going to [ __ ] your whole

1569
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:57,439
family yeah and so it was serious stuff

1570
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,079
like you know it was wasn't wasn't

1571
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,079
anything he ever played around with but

1572
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,880
you know one of my favorite quotes from

1573
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:08,280
him actually is fortune favors the

1574
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:11,000
cautiously bold yeah and you know I

1575
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:14,720
think that was kind of his methodology

1576
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,400
was be careful and uh you know you don't

1577
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,798
ever want to be the biggest guy out

1578
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,798
there but you don't want to be the

1579
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:22,400
smallest guy you want to be the smallest

1580
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:24,119
either and always have a backup plan I

1581
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,358
always have a backup plan that that was

1582
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:27,798
what was taught to me when I was younger

1583
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,480
was I always have a backup plan yeah and

1584
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:32,079
Fortune does favor the Bold I've been

1585
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,559
saying that my whole life and it's true

1586
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,440
U anytime I'm about to do something

1587
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:38,200
stupid I say

1588
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,280
that it's worked out most of the time

1589
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:43,480
you know I guess it's always a bet but I

1590
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,880
mean in life you have to take chances

1591
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,159
you guys are taking a chance with your

1592
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,920
seed company just like I'm doing with my

1593
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:51,838
seed company and my genetics it's like

1594
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:54,119
there's definitely risk involved and I

1595
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:56,440
think small business owners have huge

1596
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:59,318
balls and it takes a lot of risk and a

1597
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:01,920
lot of energy and a lot of commitment

1598
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:03,960
you almost have to put everything into

1599
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,519
it at a certain point and it's like

1600
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,960
7even days a week 365 days a year you're

1601
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:10,440
thinking about business even if you're

1602
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,960
not wanting to but that's the beauty the

1603
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,280
blessing and the curse of it I think

1604
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,639
it's one of those things where once

1605
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,599
you're like that tied into it there's

1606
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:21,400
definitely no clocking out it's not like

1607
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:24,519
you can just turn it off but right you

1608
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,880
know that's uh that's also what makes

1609
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:29,719
the business special in my opinion and

1610
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,720
uh it's you know it's something that my

1611
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:35,798
dad has definitely put a lot of time and

1612
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:38,879
personal energy into it and it's been a

1613
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:41,960
major inspiration for me uh you know

1614
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:45,079
he's definitely taught me to be able to

1615
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:49,000
figure [ __ ] out on my own and never be

1616
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:51,119
scared to attempt something even if you

1617
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,760
know it's a little bit of a challenge

1618
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,838
yeah the I made his entire permit

1619
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,839
himself it was like a book this big you

1620
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,440
so wow yeah there's some days nobody's

1621
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:02,440
going to come save you you got to do it

1622
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:05,200
yourself you learn that quick in

1623
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:09,519
business yeah that's definitely a

1624
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:12,480
reality especially in uh this industry I

1625
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:14,838
think you can hardly get people to you

1626
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,079
know call back when they when they owe

1627
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:19,358
you a little check or something these

1628
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:21,119
days to it's not as bad as it used to be

1629
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:22,719
in some it's worse in other ways but

1630
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,240
it's not as bad as it used to be like I

1631
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,838
remember people there's like humble time

1632
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:28,239
and then there's like normal time and I

1633
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:30,519
used to drive up to humble and I'll be

1634
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:32,919
like I'll be back in a day and it would

1635
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:35,000
be like three days because you're on

1636
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,039
humble time yeah and you go into the

1637
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,119
Vortex waiting for people and waiting

1638
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,559
for people and this is before you know

1639
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,039
we had cell phones back then but not

1640
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,760
everybody has cell phones and everybody

1641
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,799
was scared to talk on cell phones and

1642
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,160
yeah but humble was a special place for

1643
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:52,199
sure definitely like nowhere else I

1644
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:55,199
really know but it's super special to me

1645
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:58,838
just you know the way that the whole

1646
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:00,519
entire Community has like been able to

1647
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:03,038
you know kind of stick together

1648
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:05,920
throughout this whole process and you

1649
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,359
know everyone has all but the best

1650
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:11,240
intentions right and you know they're

1651
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:12,639
not going to stop trying to you know do

1652
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:13,959
what they love in the place that they

1653
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,960
love it's just they're going to keep

1654
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,119
fighting yeah yeah so the thing that I

1655
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,720
would like to see the most out of

1656
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,640
everything in California is Farm to

1657
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:26,239
Table tasting experiences just like they

1658
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:27,679
have in the wine industry for cannabis

1659
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,838
you go to the Farms I feel like that

1660
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:32,598
would help save humble I think that

1661
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:34,119
would uh improve the quality of life for

1662
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:35,599
the people in the industry up there but

1663
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:38,358
like being able to go and get the

1664
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,798
tasting experience go meet the Growers

1665
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:42,759
go meet the Breeders potentially go up

1666
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:43,960
dring harvest season watch them Harvest

1667
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,440
I mean they they're starting to get bed

1668
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,838
and breakfast things like that but it's

1669
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,200
like we need tasting rooms for the

1670
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:51,159
industry it's just silly that we don't

1671
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:53,798
have them I like that idea honestly

1672
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:55,798
that's a good one I would like be a

1673
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:57,519
attractive thing to do for all the

1674
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:00,079
students that are coming in these days

1675
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,358
too totally something that I'm surprised

1676
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,318
hasn't been done yet actually yeah well

1677
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:06,920
they made it so you can't do direct

1678
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,920
sales too and I'm like that's that's not

1679
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,480
right I think that I mean I understand

1680
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:12,480
we the distribution model and how it

1681
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,838
works and it is what it is but I feel

1682
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,480
like there should be direct sales or a

1683
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:19,759
way for these Farms to do direct sales

1684
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,159
uh it's money's tight right now people

1685
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,119
you know there's a lot of people

1686
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:26,719
suffering so we've had to deal with over

1687
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:30,680
taxation I that's been a a big thing

1688
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:34,000
yeah it's been uh definitely a tough

1689
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:37,639
uphill kind of a battle it seems like

1690
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,480
you know it was a lot of false promise

1691
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:44,558
from the start at the end of the day and

1692
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:47,440
it just became you know to a point where

1693
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,359
it's not yeah it's not competitive if

1694
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:54,358
you're a small farm maybe if you're

1695
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:56,358
massive and you have you know a [ __ ] ton

1696
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:59,880
of green houses going out one

1697
01:04:56,358 --> 01:05:01,519
and you can sell packs all day for $300

1698
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,599
and that's fine for you like and you're

1699
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,798
able to make a living that's wild yeah

1700
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,640
but you know they they can maybe deal

1701
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:09,719
with all these loopholes and the crazy

1702
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:13,400
stuff that they throw at us all the time

1703
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:15,318
but you know they they definitely uh we

1704
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,559
just pushing a little too hard at the

1705
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:19,038
beginning there agreed I think we kind

1706
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:21,760
of settled on something that wasn't

1707
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,480
quite perfect not even wasn't quite

1708
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,000
perfect but was not perfect and I think

1709
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,679
being the you know we weren't the first

1710
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,920
in the US but being one of the first

1711
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:33,879
it's like we got to see how Washington

1712
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,798
did it and Colorado did it and neither

1713
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,400
of those states did it perfect either

1714
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,880
there Washington has its own state of

1715
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,440
problems but there's still stuff we

1716
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,519
really got to get figured out uh for

1717
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,400
everyone to be successful only time will

1718
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:50,278
tell I guess but you know it it's also

1719
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:53,278
just kind of uh disheartening to see the

1720
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:54,838
way that it's ended up like this it is

1721
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:56,440
but I'm one of those optimists so I

1722
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,159
always I'm very optimistic with

1723
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,920
everything yeah sometimes I shouldn't be

1724
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:01,598
so optimistic but I am I just I don't

1725
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,798
have any other way to look at stuff and

1726
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,240
I'm the balance sometimes with my other

1727
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:09,159
partners and everybody with with

1728
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:11,519
optimism I mean no that's honestly the

1729
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:13,838
best mindset to have about it and you

1730
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:16,679
know at the end of the day I think it

1731
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:19,679
will come back around and you know

1732
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:21,879
things are going to start to even out a

1733
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:23,719
little bit so well everything goes in

1734
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,119
wav so I feel like it's not going to be

1735
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:27,838
bad forever it isn't last time it's

1736
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:29,400
gonna be bad though it's like it'll get

1737
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:30,679
better and it'll get worse and it'll get

1738
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,960
better and it'll get worse and that's

1739
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:36,159
just part of life and growing pains and

1740
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,679
you know I would do this even if I

1741
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,759
wasn't getting paid to do it so I'm just

1742
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:42,598
happy that I can get paid and I can work

1743
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,400
in a place where I love what I'm doing

1744
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:46,278
it's like I don't mind working seven

1745
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,720
days a week when it's like when working

1746
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:51,719
you know my 18-year-old self would give

1747
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:53,199
me the big thumbs up for sure like you

1748
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:54,919
know and it's like my 80-year old self

1749
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,519
we're still working on that one but like

1750
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,318
I think my 18-year-old self would be

1751
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:00,519
totally Blown Away by the fact that I'm

1752
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:02,558
doing podcasts and I get to smoke weed

1753
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:04,559
all the time and I get to smoke weed oh

1754
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,480
yeah for work you know and get to try

1755
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,839
different things and I think growing

1756
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,679
plants yeah I mean we're super fortunate

1757
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:13,358
to be able to be in this industry

1758
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:17,480
absolutely I mean yeah that's one thing

1759
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:20,199
that I you know always am just insanely

1760
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:23,760
grateful for is uh you know actually

1761
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:27,118
having the ability to do what I love and

1762
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:29,440
you know be able to do it in a place

1763
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:32,400
where it's possible it's highly

1764
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:37,278
regulated I guess but it's definitely

1765
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:40,519
yeah it's definitely a privilege and um

1766
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:43,039
yeah I can't imagine being anywhere else

1767
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:45,358
it's you know something we get to do

1768
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,119
kind of often is invite people just from

1769
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,838
other

1770
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:52,640
areas like you know the folks at our

1771
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:54,239
Barcelona Branch I mentioned earlier and

1772
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:56,199
you know they're not used to seeing what

1773
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,199
we have here in California and they're

1774
01:07:56,199 --> 01:08:01,439
used to seeing you know small scale

1775
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:03,480
usually like indoor grow stuff and right

1776
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,159
so taking them out and showing them like

1777
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:08,760
fields of plants just like growing and

1778
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:12,038
they're all in complete awe and wonder

1779
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:14,400
it's you know definitely something I

1780
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:17,960
will never get tired of doing totally so

1781
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:20,520

Rosenthal Uncle Ed and you guys spent a

1783
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,480

1784
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:27,238

1796
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:59,199
crazy but but you know he makes some

1797
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,880
interesting points uh he's definitely a

1798
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:05,238
character he is an absolute character

1799
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:07,239

1800
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:10,838

01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:12,879
is he just is he just like pissed like

1802
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:16,238

1803
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,960
everything he's a he's a debater I was

1804
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:20,399
you know honestly wasn't even sure if he

1805
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,359
liked me at first and then you know I've

1806
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,079
gotten to know him pretty well over the

1807
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:25,880
last few years just traveling around

1808
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,278
together

1809
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,199
and he is one of my favorite people to

1810
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:33,319
travel with at this point he always has

1811
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:36,039
an amazing story about every place we go

1812
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:37,839
and you know he's the life of the party

1813
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:41,000
he is the life of the party yeah he's

1814
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:42,838
he's such a character and uh yeah I mean

1815
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,920
he smokes and he's really passionate

1816
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:47,519
about the

1817
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:50,480
plant um yeah he just he loves cannabis

1818
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,440
on so many different levels and he has

1819
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,278
such crazy like he has this collection

1820
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:56,678
of crazy facts in his head that they

1821
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:59,760
just come out of nowhere and I'm like

1822
01:09:56,679 --> 01:10:04,079
yeah blown away sometimes yeah yeah he

1823
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,960
is he's definitely quite a guy and when

1824
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:07,880
he came from a time where you had to

1825
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,239
think like what he was doing it was

1826
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,800
everything was kind of outside the box

1827
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:12,879
because nobody knew what the box was we

1828
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,440
were learning about the box and so he

1829
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,679
came with his writing and hid it from

1830
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:18,519
all these different angles and had all

1831
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,920
these crazy Concepts and some of them

1832
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,440
were totally crazy and some of them

1833
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,600
turned out to be actually genius yeah I

1834
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:27,279
mean that's the that's the beauty of

1835
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,679
Ed's work I guess guess uh you know

1836
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:32,359
inspiring for me to like think about

1837
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,960
people who had to fight that battle just

1838
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:38,759
to even Explore what they love and

1839
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:41,039
wanted to do so he is a fighter yeah he

1840
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:43,960
is you know he's was relentless and you

1841
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:46,399
know pursued his passion and that's

1842
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:49,760
something that I always will admire

1843
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:51,639
about Ed we wouldn't be here for if it

1844
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,320
wasn't for people like Ed we wouldn't be

1845
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,880
here doing what we do if it wasn't for

1846
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,639
people like Ed going into court and

1847
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:02,199
fighting for it writing books I

1848
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,440
mean my book I I really decent breeding

1849
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:08,319
book but it's on the backs of guys like

1850
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:12,039
Ed rosenal Jorge Cervantes Rob

1851
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:16,119
Clark Mel Frank yeah we had the joy of

1852
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:19,079
having all three of those authors um

1853
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:22,439
come out in feno Hunt with us and that

1854
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:25,000
was you know really special for me to

1855
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:27,519
have the opportunity to kind of learn

1856
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,119
from those guys cuz you know they are

1857
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:33,520
such a relevant part of you know the

1858
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,559
culture we know and love today and yeah

1859
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,840
probably wouldn't be here without people

1860
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,840
who oh and the combined Knowledge from

1861
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,199
those three people especially you know

1862
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,920
Rob Clark is a wealth of knowledge too

1863
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:45,678
he's on a whole another level he's like

1864
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,560
the guy he's the one I look up to the

1865
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,920
most probably out of the people in the

1866
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:53,480
industry um Reggie Gino is another one

1867
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:57,158
he's a friend and he wrote the forward

1868
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:59,479
in my book uh yeah he's he's amazing

1869
01:11:57,158 --> 01:12:02,559
yeah there you know there's a lot of

1870
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:04,479
people that kind of paved the pathway to

1871
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,400
you know bring us to where we are today

1872
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:09,319
and for that I'll always be grateful

1873
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:12,279
because you know it definitely wasn't an

1874
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:15,880
easy Road and you know as you mentioned

1875
01:12:12,279 --> 01:12:18,639
earlier like people did hard time for

1876
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:21,159
cannabis and a lot of people you know it

1877
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:23,000
still happens right yeah they're still

1878
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:25,719
locking people up and I think for me

1879
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,920
that's the best part of legalization is

1880
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:30,239
not putting people in prison for a plant

1881
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,520
yeah I think it's silly I think it's

1882
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,799
just it's not right and you know I I you

1883
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,040
you can call them Outlaws but don't call

1884
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:40,159
them criminals I I never really was able

1885
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:42,519
to wrap my head around that personally

1886
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:44,319
either it's you know it's something

1887
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,800
that's always been kind of absurd to me

1888
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:50,198
because it's like you look at alcohol

1889
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,600
and you know that that actually kills

1890
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:54,519
multiple people it's highly dangerous

1891
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,960
you you know you can see the bad in it

1892
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:59,960
yeah some you know like serious negative

1893
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,800
side effects and then you compare it to

1894
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:06,520
cannabis which is you know like at the

1895
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,520
point was getting people arrested thrown

1896
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,800
in jail for years and years and years

1897
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,000
right how is that you know how is that

1898
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,880
even comparable it just never made sense

1899
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,479
to even as like even as a kid I was just

1900
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:21,840
like why is it that cannabis is bad

1901
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:24,319
never got it well I think the problem is

1902
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,760
is the Cannabis Tunes you in and alcohol

1903
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:27,840
Tunes you out

1904
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,000
and I think the problem with alcohol is

1905
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,840
is that it Tunes you out and it's

1906
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,719
dangerous right it numbs you to the

1907
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,639
world where cannabis kind of tunes you

1908
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:37,000
in it makes you look at yourself and you

1909
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:39,719
know I think it makes the world a much

1910
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,760
better place where alcohol I you know I

1911
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:44,560
think it's there and I think people

1912
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,119
enjoy it I enjoy alcohol sometimes but I

1913
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,760
don't think it necessarily makes the

1914
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:50,519
world a better place like cannabis no it

1915
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,440
gives people panic attacks maybe that I

1916
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,800
mean that's bad but but I think that's

1917
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,519
the worst of it it also makes you look

1918
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,800
at yourself from a different perspective

1919
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,280
it kind of opens the world up in a lot

1920
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,159
of other ways you can make a negative

1921
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:06,840
out of anything if you know abused in

1922
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:09,000
the wrong way I guess but I feel like

1923
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,079
just overall it was you know was the

1924
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,319
fact that one thing was totally socially

1925
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:15,719
acceptable and you know everyone was

1926
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:18,079
doing it and it's legal and stole sold

1927
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:19,760
in all the stores and on the shelves and

1928
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:21,719
right you know and then next thing you

1929
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,320
know it's like someone's getting picked

1930
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:25,880
up with an ounce and getting thrown in

1931
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:29,119
jail and like right you know and they've

1932
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:31,520
got cases or cartons of cigarettes and

1933
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:33,319
that's okay yeah but an ounce of weed

1934
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,880
man that's put you in jail for that

1935
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:36,679
that's you know it's such a weird way of

1936
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,600
thinking and I think it's such a

1937
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:41,359
backwards way of thinking that you look

1938
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:43,039
at a 100 years from now or 100 years in

1939
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,639
the past maybe even you know you start

1940
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:45,639
going further in the past or further in

1941
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:48,039
the future they're going to be like

1942
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:49,960
that's crazy makes zero

1943
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:51,439
sense so but there's a lot of things

1944
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,039
right now that are crazy anything in

1945
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,198
life is a bunch of failure to get to the

1946
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:59,560
point where you're really good at it

1947
01:14:56,198 --> 01:15:01,119
uh yeah and then like also being willing

1948
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,120
to learn I think that's a whole another

1949
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:05,399
thing like I've just learned from so

1950
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:07,000
many experiences where I'm like oh yeah

1951
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:09,158
I'm never going to do autoflowers autof

1952
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,399
flowers suck and now I breed autoflowers

1953
01:15:09,158 --> 01:15:12,198
I've been breeding autof flowers for

1954
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:13,638
quite a while now but like there was a

1955
01:15:12,198 --> 01:15:16,158
point where I was like autoflowers are

1956
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:17,760
garbage I'm never I was in Spain and I

1957
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:20,879
saw autof flowers that were This Tall

1958
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:23,400
that smelled like hay and this was like

1959
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,079
2010s something like that and I was like

1960
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:27,319
I'm never doing that I don't want any

1961
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:29,279
part of that and then you know years

1962
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:31,079
later I see good a flowers and next

1963
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:32,319
thing you know I'm working with people

1964
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:33,840
that are breeding good a flowers next

1965
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,519
thing you know I'm breeding good Auto

1966
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,119
flowers and I think there's a place for

1967
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,199
a bunch of stuff but to say that

1968
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:42,238
something's no good it's like sometimes

1969
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:44,119
you have to look at it more than it's

1970
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:47,039
just no good there's something to be

1971
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:49,319
learned every time you fail anyways if

1972
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:51,560
you look at it that way and you know I

1973
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:55,039
don't think really any grow is ever a

1974
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,880
failure in my book it's like I'm I'm

1975
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:59,639
interested in you know just about

1976
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:02,279
anything if I think that it's Unique

1977
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:05,319
enough or you know well you can learn so

1978
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:07,198
much every time and I think also data

1979
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,519
collection like you probably grew up

1980
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:11,678
with data collection most

1981
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,360
people I wouldn't say most people but a

1982
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,279
lot of people don't collect any sort of

1983
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,679
data they just grow to grow or at least

1984
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,960
that's how it was and now slowly but

1985
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:21,279
surely a lot of us have really gone

1986
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,639
towards collecting a lot of data as much

1987
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:24,119
data as possible because that's how you

1988
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:25,880
improve I think that's the best way to

1989
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:27,840
improve and some people people are like

1990
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,520
what's not natural is what somebody said

1991
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,239
the other day I'm like well what is

1992
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,480
natural you know what I mean you want

1993
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:37,359
evolution of canvas is via Human

1994
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:40,238
Assistance essentially so you you can't

1995
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,880
claim that that isn't natural to I mean

1996
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,479
we get all sorts of funny stuff we have

1997
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:47,359
people tell us like the fem seeds are

1998
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:50,799
GMO and oh yeah all this stuff I'm

1999
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:52,279
like I don't know if that qualifies but

2000
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,679
well and are that fem seeds are bad to

2001
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,960
breed with or that fem seeds are

2002
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,760
anything I don't think there's anything

2003
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,480
wrong with femin seeds I think that

2004
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,920
regular seeds are good too I do a round

2005
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:03,279
of regular seeds every year in my

2006
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,039
backyard and I do and we don't do any

2007
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:07,158
regular breeding at the facility ever

2008
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:08,719
because I don't want male pollen in if

2009
01:17:07,158 --> 01:17:10,359
there was a little bit of contamination

2010
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,600
where it's like okay some Fen pollen got

2011
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:14,399
on something else no big deal right like

2012
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,440
it would be very minimal well that's the

2013
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,519
difference with rigs and F poen people

2014
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:21,359
don't realize it takes a lot of [ __ ]

2015
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:25,360
work to get the same amount of feminized

2016
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:27,880
pollen like nearly you know

2017
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:30,079
so it's you know it's a whole different

2018
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,400
ballpark but I I can understand why you

2019
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,920
wouldn't want ragas around because those

2020
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:35,519
things will just poof all over

2021
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,440
everywhere yeah and I love I mean I love

2022
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,880
working with male cannabis plants

2023
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,000
they're something special they look

2024
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,920
amazing yeah uh you know and especially

2025
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,359
the ones where they stack tight where

2026
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,399
you have these male flowers that are

2027
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:50,399
just really tightly stacked and I just

2028
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:52,638
it looks yeah amazing I really like the

2029
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:54,000
yeah the Reversed plants it's like you

2030
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:56,159
know it's interesting cuz you kind of

2031
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,800
get to see the fish 50/50 where it will

2032
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:00,559
retain like that bud structure right

2033
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,719
versus you know the ones that are all

2034
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,600
just fully hanging down so it's like

2035
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,880
yeah it's like a combination of both it

2036
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:09,360
almost has the little spikes of pollen

2037
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,840
pods just coming out like a bud right I

2038
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:12,319
love shaking male plants I there's

2039
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,880
something special about seeing dusts of

2040
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:16,840
pollen and realizing what that is

2041
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,880
satisfying capable yeah

2042
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,400
absolutely yeah the only reason I have a

2043
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,600
big Instagram following is because of

2044
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:25,559
that it's because I shook the the plants

2045
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,719
and got that dust cloud of pollen yeah

2046
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,480
yeah but there's something special about

2047
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,560
working with males and breeding and

2048
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:33,638
putting the time in with females I think

2049
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,880
a lot of people the the female breeding

2050
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:37,600
aspect of it it's like it's Technical

2051
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,079
and there's a lot of timing involved

2052
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,360
there's a smaller window and if you

2053
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:41,880
really hit the window perfectly your

2054
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:43,519
seeds come out nice and even but if you

2055
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,119
don't you're going to have a bunch of

2056
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,760
white seeds a bunch of yellow seeds a

2057
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,559
bunch of lighter seeds oh yeah I try to

2058
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,119
hit a real short pollination window when

2059
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,480
we do it and make sure there's way more

2060
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:55,719
than enough pollen we always have

2061
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:58,119
redundancies so we make we use live

2062
01:18:55,719 --> 01:18:59,600
plants sometimes we hang plants just

2063
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:01,279
trying to get as much pollen in there

2064
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,039
with with feminized breeding as possible

2065
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,439
you got to do it it's you know it's

2066
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,719
tough

2067
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:08,479
because once you're used to regular

2068
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,079
breeding for a little while it's like

2069
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,799
you know you just shake it once or twice

2070
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:15,479
and you're going to get a ton of seeds

2071
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,400
yeah then you switch over to the the fem

2072
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:21,678
and it's you know it's a whole different

2073
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:23,679
little world and the pollen I think just

2074
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,000
doesn't like even release as well half

2075
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:28,359
the time is what prod

2076
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,840
much it produces a little less but I

2077
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:32,479
feel like sometimes they don't open

2078
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,920
right right uh and you know they have

2079
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:37,039
like a tendency to get like just the

2080
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:38,480
tiniest bit of moisture in them and just

2081
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:40,319
yeah that's all you need the tiniest

2082
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:43,599
neutralizes It screw at that point and

2083
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:45,799
then they just never open like right and

2084
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,840
certain genetics just don't produce

2085
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:51,320
barely any pollen or none some of them

2086
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,440
are so hard to get to flip SV I had

2087
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:54,238
problems with blue dream till we

2088
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:55,359
switched over to the nano silver that we

2089
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:56,718
use now

2090
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:58,599
but that's another one where it's like

2091
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,000
an easy one to it's fairly easy to

2092
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,760
reverse and it creates a decent amount

2093
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,679
of

2094
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,840
pollen but uh you that's tricky too like

2095
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,600
what what reversal methods do you use

2096
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,960
and you know certain reversal methods

2097
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,920
work better on certain plants and you

2098
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,439
know it's it's a lot of fun though yeah

2099
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,800
definitely I mean I think you know as

2100
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:19,039
long as it's not as long as it's not

2101
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,039
like a stressinduced reversal then I

2102
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:22,760
right you know I approve of that method

2103
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,960
I think you know

2104
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:28,719
that's always going to lead to you know

2105
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:30,679
potentially inbreeding some like INX

2106
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:33,079
traits in the future if you're just

2107
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:35,760
stressing it out and seeing if it seeds

2108
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:38,559
yeah yeah I don't I don't know if I can

2109
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,320
say that's a effective way but other

2110
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,560
than that I've seen like you know I've

2111
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:46,479
seen super super successful F breeding

2112
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:49,880
coming out recently and I mean I think

2113
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:52,198
the Autos that I have have less than a

2114
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,239
0.001% expression of intersex which is

2115
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:56,238
really good I think yeah like one in a

2116
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:59,279
thousand but yeah and I mean fem seeds

2117
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:02,198
it used to be like if you had nine out

2118
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:04,840
of 10 you were okay and now it's like

2119
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:08,079
one out of a thousand yeah no it really

2120
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:10,279
has the standard is you know always

2121
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:12,639
always going up as it should yeah that

2122
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:14,079
bar keeps moving and it's like same

2123
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,600
thing with genetics I feel like there's

2124
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:19,198
some people that are just breeding the

2125
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,920
same gelados you know within that whole

2126
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,759
thing and then there's other companies

2127
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,440
budalo they're from uh Menino they're

2128
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,199
doing some really w stuff with long

2129
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:31,719
flowering varieties and when I was at

2130
01:21:28,198 --> 01:21:33,719
canest I realized the diversity up in

2131
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:35,960
Humble is way more than it is in the Bay

2132
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:38,239
Area because it's like so specific here

2133
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:40,279
purple candy gas and you can go more gas

2134
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:42,359
and less candy but it's got to be purple

2135
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:43,840
a little bit of purple at the very least

2136
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:45,719
and up there you got you still have a

2137
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,000
good amount of variety and then there's

2138
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:49,639
the white Thorn Rose which kind of

2139
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,119
checks that box too yeah which I love

2140
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:53,600
that's true there's definitely there's

2141
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:56,039
definitely some really great like old

2142
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,600
school stuff up there and you know a lot

2143
01:21:56,039 --> 01:22:00,639
of people that just like really you know

2144
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:03,760
keep their stuff that they like to grow

2145
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:06,039
around rather than chasing off like

2146
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:09,520
what's you know going to look good in

2147
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:11,639
their bag I guess it's like half the

2148
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,480
time I mean I swear and the stuff that

2149
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:15,000
you know I've tried some things from

2150
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:17,599
dispensaries where I'm just like you

2151
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,920
know this this doesn't taste like

2152
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,159
anything at

2153
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:23,880
all yeah where's the

2154
01:22:21,158 --> 01:22:25,879
flavor there's so much of that stuff

2155
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:27,719
that it's out it's just missing flavor

2156
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,239
and like I think some of the genetics

2157
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:32,279
they put in there like Oreos is kind of

2158
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,678
missing flavor it's like they say

2159
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:36,119
cardboard turps but it's just kind of

2160
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,600
missing turps cardboard turps yeah yeah

2161
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:39,719
well then purple punch is like the big

2162
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,560
let down for me it's like I I go to

2163
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:44,520
smoke purple punch and if you grow it it

2164
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:46,120
looks so amazing and you you do like a

2165
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,080
finger rub get a whole bunch of resin

2166
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:49,880
smells pretty good but then you light a

2167
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,479
joint of it and like that initial joint

2168
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,719
you fire up is like oh it almost tastes

2169
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:55,959
like it might have something the next

2170
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:57,840
hit and then it just doesn't and so then

2171
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:59,520
it just tastes like you might as well

2172
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,520
smoke tobacco in my opinion because it

2173
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,639
doesn't really have any flavor yeah

2174
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:07,239
that's never that's never fun it has to

2175
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,679
taste good yeah but that's in see that's

2176
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:11,919
what I contribute to Instagram's uh

2177
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,440
contribution to the Cannabis world is

2178
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,760
they've ruined the way it's all about

2179
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:18,238
the way it looks it's got to be the bag

2180
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,840
has to look amazing it has to be frosted

2181
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:22,079
and you can have stuff that tastes

2182
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,560
amazing that's not super Frosty you can

2183
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,840
have stuff that tastes amazing that's

2184
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:28,840
not super beautiful we need to refocus

2185
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:33,679
on effect is kind of my takeaway

2186
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:36,199
from the last six months of i' like re

2187
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:37,480
re I change direction kind you know

2188
01:23:36,198 --> 01:23:38,678
sometimes the boat goes to the left or

2189
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,198
the right we had to get it back going

2190
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:42,800
straight and I think effect at the end

2191
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:45,319
of the day needs to be the primary focus

2192
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,480
and then turpion is great you know and

2193
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:48,079
there's other things like commercial

2194
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:50,000
viability how many days does it finish

2195
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:51,960
in and all these things but like really

2196
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,079
going back to that effect like how does

2197
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:58,158
it make you feel I'm just you know happy

2198
01:23:55,079 --> 01:24:01,079
to see some interest starting to gain

2199
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:03,960
traction and like things deeper than the

2200
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:06,800
THC and the look of the bud right right

2201
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:08,880
and I I've always smoked for effect like

2202
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,840
if I you know didn't like the effect of

2203
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:15,319
a strain definitely not going back yeah

2204
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:18,039
but you know it's also I guess just also

2205
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:21,198
the framework of the industry right now

2206
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:23,519
makes it almost impossible to like even

2207
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:25,399
go that extra mile when you know you

2208
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,440
don't know if there's the market for it

2209
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:29,638
or you know it's not even a question

2210
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:31,279
that's being asked right now yeah so I

2211
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:33,400
mean that's why things like this are

2212
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:35,920
important and it's awesome that you're

2213
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:37,719
out there spreading the word yeah I mean

2214
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,679
it's I totally important I think that

2215
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:41,760
going back to the the roots of why we're

2216
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,920
all here at the end of the day it's the

2217
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,360
way it makes us feel and all these other

2218
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,679
things are great they're kind of

2219
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,639
superficial but they're all great but

2220
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:51,158
like the way it tastes and the way all

2221
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:53,118
these things should go secondary to like

2222
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:55,079
how's it make you feel we're doing this

2223
01:24:53,118 --> 01:24:57,079
for you know but also it's social so you

2224
01:24:55,079 --> 01:24:58,760
want something to tastes good or

2225
01:24:57,079 --> 01:25:01,800
something that tastes really

2226
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:05,400
good yeah I

2227
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:07,679
mean it's just a going to be a

2228
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:10,359
constantly evolving thing I think you

2229
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,399
know people are getting more and more

2230
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:15,439
into learning and educating themselves

2231
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:19,039
on product and right you know it's going

2232
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:22,079
to come with time I feel like it's you

2233
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:23,880
know something that I as someone who's

2234
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:26,679
been consuming for a while seems like

2235
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,359
you know a no-brainer I'm like I just

2236
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:31,199
want to smoke some weed that tastes

2237
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:33,198
really good yeah but I guess it's not

2238
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:35,559
you know for I have to put myself in

2239
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:38,079
that mindset of like you know the new

2240
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:40,440
customer who hasn't ever been exposed to

2241
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:42,600
this stuff well most people have never

2242
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:44,238
smoked the quality of stuff that you get

2243
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,039
to smoke on a regular basis and I just

2244
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:47,638
have to remind myself of that all the

2245
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:49,519
time because it's like I have access to

2246
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:51,440
really amazing tasting and stuff that

2247
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,760
makes you feel good but a lot of people

2248
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:55,319
have never experienced that once in

2249
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,520
their life if they did it would change

2250
01:25:55,319 --> 01:26:00,279
their minds like it did for me it would

2251
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,679
CH it was like I smoked in the 90s I

2252
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:03,679
smoked cat piss and that completely

2253
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:05,800
changed and that was that wasn't candy

2254
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:08,679
gas nothing it was

2255
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:10,039
skunky uh ammonia and it was like all

2256
01:26:08,679 --> 01:26:12,000
the way down to the roach it was skunky

2257
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:15,000
ammonia I'm like what the hell this is

2258
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,960
crazy tastes so good and that changed me

2259
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,560
forever then Sour Diesel came along the

2260
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:21,158
ogs that were like that and the Bubba

2261
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,400
cush and the master cush that we went

2262
01:26:21,158 --> 01:26:26,158
through all these things that were just

2263
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:29,079
absolutely amazing and then humble

2264
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:32,599
outdoor classic so what's your favorite

2265
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:35,319
strain of all time I definitely would

2266
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,639
say the blueberry muffin yeah but I

2267
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:39,238
don't know I've been really really

2268
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:44,159
liking our orange cream pop this year

2269
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:45,839
too so the is orange ice like the

2270
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:48,799
popsicle that has the ice cream in the

2271
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,960
middle yeah like an orange pop yeah

2272
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:54,880
that's awesome yeah it's like it's like

2273
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,600
you know it's citrusy like super creamy

2274
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,920
kind a different tarpine profile I

2275
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,800
haven't been used to it yet so I don't

2276
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:04,319
know I guess that's probably right now

2277
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,039
my favorite too but subcool had like a

2278
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,840
orange creamsicle but I don't know what

2279
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:11,639
it was called but it tasted like orange

2280
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:13,039
creamsicle I remember smoking flour and

2281
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:17,480
can't remember who it was if it was

2282
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:18,920
sunny sunny Chi Shane from TGA or who it

2283
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:20,678
was but they had the Cherry Cola and

2284
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:22,760
then they had the orange creamsicle it

2285
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:24,800
was like crazy to smoke these things

2286
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:26,119
side by side like the Cherry tasted like

2287
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,079
Cherry Cola and then the orange

2288
01:27:26,118 --> 01:27:30,359
creamsicle totally tasted just like an

2289
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:33,559
orange creamsicle I mean it is like

2290
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:36,158
incredible how much diversity there is

2291
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:39,400
in Turpin it's like it you know kind of

2292
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:42,118
blows my mind still I can't believe that

2293
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:43,920
it's actually just naturally Bud

2294
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:46,679
sometimes like with some of these new

2295
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:49,319
Candy ones and all the crazy exotic

2296
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:51,279
stuff I'm like Skittles exactly it's

2297
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:52,559
like you're like wait well blueberry

2298
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:54,238
muffins right up there with that too I

2299
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,800
feel like yeah there's some of these

2300
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,399
it's like so close to like food or so

2301
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,119
close to like you know these different

2302
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:03,599
things that we smell in nature Pine like

2303
01:28:01,118 --> 01:28:05,319
OG's really like really good OG is super

2304
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,719
Piney it smells like fresh pine needles

2305
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:09,599
I love that it's kind of a mind [ __ ]

2306
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:12,719
sometimes though I'm like I feel like

2307
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,280
there's just so much yeah it's wild yeah

2308
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,800
there's more diversity in cannabis than

2309
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:18,840
any other crop in agriculture yeah I've

2310
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,560
heard that and like that definitely

2311
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:24,520
blows my mind but I I believe it because

2312
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:27,119
there is just you know there there's so

2313
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:30,040
much out there and there's you know even

2314
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:32,079
new like totally different combinations

2315
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:35,000
that I still smell to this day and I'm

2316
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:36,359
like wow that's different I like it yeah

2317
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,719
imagine if we had that many types of

2318
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:40,359
arch chokes you know it's crazy like or

2319
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:41,719
any other thing you find in the grocery

2320
01:28:40,359 --> 01:28:43,799
store it's like there's nothing like

2321
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:45,600
that with tomatoes or you know we have

2322
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:49,800
heirloom tomatoes what is there maybe 15

2323
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:52,000
or 20 that are commercially available at

2324
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:54,320
the very most and that is you know that

2325
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:57,960
is kind of the freaky thing about you

2326
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:59,759
know large scale agricultural crops is

2327
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:03,520
scary thing you know a lot of them get

2328
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:05,840
monopolized and turned into you know two

2329
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:08,440
three four options and it's probably

2330
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,840
going to be from Monsanto if something

2331
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:13,118
like that were to happen in the Cannabis

2332
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:15,159
industry it would you know it would

2333
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:17,960
change everything and it would

2334
01:29:15,158 --> 01:29:20,238
definitely would not be ideal but I feel

2335
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:22,319
like there's too many people fighting

2336
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,839
that honestly if people try to do that

2337
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:25,840
people would go back to the black market

2338
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,520
right so like the easiest way for them

2339
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,800
to get people doing the black market

2340
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:32,119
thing again going from where we're at

2341
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,360
now is to try to take what we have away

2342
01:29:32,118 --> 01:29:37,479
from yeah

2343
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:40,479
absolutely and you know I think at the

2344
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:42,559
end of the day it's like it it's also

2345
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:44,718
something that you have to have a

2346
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,480
background in like an education and be

2347
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,960
passionate about like back to like you

2348
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:49,959
know you're going to fail and it's going

2349
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:53,359
to take a while to grow your perfect

2350
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,600
plant but you know I don't think that

2351
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,639
some crazy

2352
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,600
like Monsanto scientists could just take

2353
01:29:57,639 --> 01:30:02,440
up the world of breeding and make like

2354
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:05,000
the next best strain they don't know how

2355
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:07,118
they don't they don't know the plant

2356
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,600
like they're not you know they're not

2357
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:11,000
passionate about it they the only

2358
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,560
problem is is there are passionate

2359
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,600
people that they could hire that's the

2360
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,000
only problem is there's people that I

2361
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:20,440
wouldn't call them sellouts some people

2362
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,800
would call them sellouts but I think

2363
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:23,238
eventually we're probably going to sell

2364
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,960
our business like that's just part of

2365
01:30:23,238 --> 01:30:27,479
the model is eventually you know I think

2366
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:30,239
that it'll evolve into something I'm not

2367
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:31,959
sure what but uh we want to collaborate

2368
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,000
and work with people and build this

2369
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,480
business up to something now working

2370
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,359
with Monsanto that doesn't excite me

2371
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:38,759
that's like working with Philip Morris

2372
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:41,479
yeah you know and that's about as

2373
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,000
exciting as Philip Morris for me but

2374
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:46,279
there are people that will sell their

2375
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,800
souls it wouldn't be the first time but

2376
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:52,158
for sure you know there is also a lot of

2377
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:56,000
people in the industry that you know are

2378
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:59,079
way too loyal to the plant and people to

2379
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,800
go there and they'll just fight to the

2380
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,920
death yeah I think it'll yeah the

2381
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,840
Canabis industry there's a lot of

2382
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,440
hard-headed people that won't take no

2383
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:08,639
for an answer and they're going to keep

2384
01:31:06,439 --> 01:31:10,638
fighting I mean yeah God all love them I

2385
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,560
mean that's how you get [ __ ] done many

2386
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:15,000
generations too it's like now we're on

2387
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,280
second and third and fourth generation

2388
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
people you know it's like their their

2389
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:20,960
grandparents did it now and so soon it's

2390
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,560
going to be their grandparents

2391
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:26,679
grandparents and you know it's kind of a

2392
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:30,199
way of life at least that's how I grew

2393
01:31:26,679 --> 01:31:33,639
up with it so it's amazing to you know

2394
01:31:30,198 --> 01:31:36,519
get to see people passing it down to the

2395
01:31:33,639 --> 01:31:38,560
next Generations and you know every year

2396
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:40,480
it's getting it's at least getting a

2397
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,880
little bit easier it's a little more

2398
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,759
normalized every year it's a little like

2399
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,319
the people who were against it like 20

2400
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,480
years ago most of them are like well

2401
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:51,079
it's not so bad like literally the we're

2402
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,638
over 50% approval for cannabis in the

2403
01:31:51,079 --> 01:31:53,960
United States yeah that's what I was

2404
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:56,239
going to say is it's getting a little

2405
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:59,039
easier for the average family to like

2406
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:02,118
even be involved in right cannabis and

2407
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:04,719
so you know it's great to

2408
01:32:02,118 --> 01:32:09,000
like actually be able to have that

2409
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:12,279
opportunity I will say but you know

2410
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,639
we'll see how it goes seriously so if

2411
01:32:12,279 --> 01:32:16,399
you had one piece of advice for other

2412
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,480
females that are looking to come into

2413
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:20,118
the

2414
01:32:17,479 --> 01:32:24,519
industry uh what would that one piece of

2415
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:27,519
advice be um it would just be to not get

2416
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:30,320
discouraged and to know that there's

2417
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:32,480
always space for you in the industry and

2418
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:34,759
you belong here just as much as anybody

2419
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:38,319
else that's basically it I would love to

2420
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:42,000
see more ladies and the ladies that are

2421
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:44,079
in the industry today I have so much

2422
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,719
respect for every single one of you yeah

2423
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:47,559
it's more and more it's it's actually

2424
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:49,840
amazing I feel like more and more we're

2425
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:52,400
getting women in and women women's

2426
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,840
CEOs you know and there's basically

2427
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:55,039
there's plenty of room for everybody and

2428
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,840
anybody who wants to do it that's

2429
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:58,639
stubborn enough to do it and make it in

2430
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:00,560
this industry and you know we're not

2431
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:02,679
rock stars anymore it's you know we're

2432
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,719
we're farmers and so there's room for

2433
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:08,319
everybody I absolutely agree with that I

2434
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:10,118
think uh women belong in the industry

2435
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:13,000
for sure it's a lot different than it

2436
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:15,439
was 20 years ago you know it definitely

2437
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:19,238
is I mean I feel like you know there's

2438
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:22,399
still some like stigmas around women and

2439
01:33:19,238 --> 01:33:24,479
like their involvement but you know at

2440
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:26,759
this point I think it's a wide accepted

2441
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:29,839
thing that like women have the Natural

2442
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:33,199
Touch for cultivation and you know a

2443
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:35,239
special connection with the plant and a

2444
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,799
