13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,960
so let's dive into some history how did

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,920
you get started in the industry cannabis

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,679
and I have had a love affair since I was

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,719
like probably about 14 it's when I've

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:48,359
been started smoking every day um by the

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,600
time it was you know the early 2000s

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,479
prop 215 had just passed in San

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,160
Francisco and there were clubs popping

21
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,558
up and in Berkeley and Oakland and so I

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,319
got my medical card when I was like just

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,320
when I turned 18 third floor went to the

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,400
third floor that's exactly right me too

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,040
and the patient ID center on like San

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,159
Pablo that whole time and um yeah just

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,520
by the time it was starting to become an

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,118
option I was just kind of flowed right

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,679
into it so I was already making Truffles

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,239
and hard candies I've made like

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,200
everything infused over the years and

32
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,919
servicing the clubs and started a a all

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,240
female Collective called the omgrown

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,560
collective in 2008 and um yeah and then

35
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,679
went on to somehow get the first permit

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,439
for manufacturing in California in 2017

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,759
and yeah yeah here we are the rest is

38
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,639
history the rest is history yeah so the

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,159
edible game has changed so much in the

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,359
last 2530 years that I mean since since

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,560
91 I mean I've been smoking since 91 but

42
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:56,640
since since I would say 96 97 it was the

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,920
same in 91 as it was in 96 and then it

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,439
kind of started with prop 215 it's

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,719
started changing and people started

46
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:04,959
getting creative and I think there was

47
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:06,679
always like the hippies that got

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,959
creative you know on the lot at the Dead

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,000
shows and stuff like that you stuff but

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,680
like the it's it's next level now it's

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
everything's milligram dosed uh you're

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,879
getting stuff that's safe and sanitary

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,959
and

54
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,598
consistent and we never talked about

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,840
milligrams before it was like oh here

56
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,518
here's a brownie and you never knew I

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,560
mean oh it's a strong brownie or oh it's

58
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,239
a weak Brownie and I think weak back

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,360
then was probably 100 milligrams

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,878
absolutely yeah everything has um really

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,959
gotten refined if if that word fits you

62
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,280
know yeah and um it's it's wild because

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,000
we measure these invisible cannabinoids

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,000
that turn from an acid you know get

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,598
converted and activated at a certain

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,639
temperature and we measure these

67
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,000
invisible things and um you're allowed

68
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,158
to be 10% over or 10% under in

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,878
California like in Canada you can only

70
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:03,840
be 5% under yeah which I thought how

71
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,158
Canadian yeah how Canadian right yeah uh

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,158
and it's just this

73
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:11,479
wild like Wormhole of granular cannabis

74
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:14,439
science it's all changed so much I mean

75
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,798
the flowers changed yeah uh to a degree

76
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,519
the flowers changed I mean it's

77
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,159
Everything's changed and everything will

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,799
always change it's it's all constantly

79
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,639
evolving I mean we're all constantly

80
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,000
evolving it's true and it's it's

81
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,359
absolutely amazing I mean I think that

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,840
there's a lot of people hating on the

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,640
way it is right now and I think it's

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,400
still just as amazing amazing uh in a

85
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,119
different way so and it's a struggle for

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,879
some people I get it so but I think we

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,319
got to count our blessings I think that

88
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:44,000
less people in prison is a good thing

89
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,199
yeah it's interesting I think everyone's

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,878
had their like expectations and reality

91
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,598
shattered of where we're at with legal

92
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:52,399
cannabis by this point so you know it's

93
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,479
kind of like six in one half a dozen in

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,640
the other where you know the cards are a

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,158
little stacked against you with all

96
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,399
those taxes and all the things that you

97
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,000
have to do so right the beginning of

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,920
legal ization as far as recreational

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,039
there was like the first people that had

100
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,158
the most amount of money got their

101
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,239
licenses right and especially with flow

102
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,759
that didn't necessarily mean that they

103
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,560
had good flour that mean that they could

104
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,280
get their license and they had something

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,319
on the market but that and so that was

106
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,079
disappointing for me seeing all the

107
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,358
flower that was not very good and it was

108
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,000
like at the bottom it could only get

109
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:26,279
better and it has it has gradually

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,720
gotten better and you know with extract

111
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,679
2 I I know like uh absolute extract

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,720
canic craft those guys you're working

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
with them I believe uhhuh those guys

114
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,639
have been pushing the envelope Dennis

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,840
has been pushing the envelope for years

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,439
absolutely it's true yeah both Dennis

117
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,439
and Ned are for sure pioneers and you

118

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,439

00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,839
are pioneers and revolutionaries in the

127
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:10,079
industry and they're constantly you know

128

evolving and showing up and making

129
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:17,000

133
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:28,560
we've made everything over the years

134
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,879
we've done like the holy anointing oil

tinctures um now we mostly focus on

138
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,519
Epsom salts and bath bombs hydrotherapy

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,840

uh but we've we've done everything over

142
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,719
the years we also have a CBD side to our

143

pound buckets wow yeah some body oils

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,800
and a couple other balms I'm a huge fan

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,038
of bath salts the kind you smoke but but

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,240
epom salt I do uh I we have a jacuzzi

149
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,478
tub at the house and I'm getting older

150
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,720
and I get aches and pains yeah and epsom

151
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,038
salt is absolutely one of the best ways

152
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,599
to help with

153
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,279
inflammation uh it you know it's high in

154
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,719
magnesium it is magnesium basic it's

155
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,799
magnesium salt but uh it it's just

156
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,680
amazing and then adding something

157
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,840
like cannabis exactly full spectrum

158
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,800
exactly I think that's just a big game

159
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,119
changer and a lot of people I think a

160
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,199
lot of people are unaware of the

161
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,959
benefits but as you get older it's like

162
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,160
there's little secrets that's one of

163
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,159
them it's true I feel like uh you know

164
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,120
magnesium could alleviate 90% of

165
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,880
people's ailments and woes yeah um and

166
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,560
it's best absorbed topically yeah so

167
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,800
Epsom salts are an affordable effective

168
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,319
way to relieve pain and do literally a

169
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,598
million other things Epsom salt does

170
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,720
like a million things it even

171
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,079
strengthens your hair it strips away

172
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,199
shampoo buildup it stops spasms it takes

173
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,478

177
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,478

178
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,400
wake up like charged up with like not

179
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,079
puffy and dehydrated unlike alcohol

180
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,478
which I love like a glass of wine here

181
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,878
and there I don't need to demonize

182
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,639
alcohol but like after a cannabis bath

183
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,240
you sleep like a baby and you you wake

184
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,800
up actually moisturized and nourished

185
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,598
yeah and rested and like completely like

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,240
depuffed yeah and hydrated it's amazing

187
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:32,120
yeah and so

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
um we take pharmaceutic salt

189
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,399
pharmaceutic grade salt Epsom salt and

190
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,439
we um we Infuse that with apricot oil

191
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,878
avocado seed hoba and argon which are

192
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,158
like basically the headiest of the

193
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,039
headyy oils like yeah so like sebum is

194
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,719
what our skin secretes to make scars go

195
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,519
away and it's found only other place in

196
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,319
nature is hoba oil so these things are

197
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,758
really good for your face for your skin

198
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,000
um moisturizing oils that are all

199
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,360
plant-based and of course full spectrum

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,918
cannabis yeah yeah and then therapeutic

201
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,598
grade essential oils yeah it's amazing

202
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,079
um I blush when I say this of course I'm

203
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,800
literally five minutes in and I'm about

204
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,240
to drop my little bomb but it's so worth

205
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,400
it because I watch People's Light Bulbs

206
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,519
go off so there's actually a a

207
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,000
concentration of receptors in the womb

208
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:22,478
space for women wow yeah and also the

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,680
colon is like a sponge so you know

210
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,279
unlike eating an edible or taking a hit

211
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,319
of weed there's really no chance of a

212
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,158
bad trip but it's like very sedating

213
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,399
they do everything a topical does but so

214
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,240
much more wow yeah so um like couples

215
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,799
love them um they really like can just

216
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,200
shift your mood and take your worries

217
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,958
away like even in the witchy World salts

218
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,640
pull negative energies and they cut

219
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,319
energy so like a lot of people who are

220
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,360
healers take salt bath every night to

221
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
cut everyone's energy from them yeah

222
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,919
yeah even salt was like a preservative

223
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,319
in history or like secretly that's why

224
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,479
you know what I'm saying you got haters

225
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,120
be gone and so um in like many you know

226
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,039
psychic people's place you'll see a bowl

227
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,639
of salt in the corner CU it's absorbing

228
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,599
negative energy right um also you know

229
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,399
cannabis the government patent is for

230
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,560
neuroprotectant properties as well as

231
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,440
antioxidative effects right so the

232
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,399
antioxidants cancel free radicals which

233
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,040
is what makes all wrinkles and illness

234
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,440
so it's like on top of that it just

235
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,799
leaves your skin like shining and

236
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
nourished and supple it's like a beauty

237
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,719
benefit and it's also great for your

238
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,799
hair so I'm like there's not really

239
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,600
anything these these cannabis baths

240
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,679
don't do yeah yeah it's pretty amazing

241
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,399
it's it's my favorite consumption form

242
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,919
besides inhalation yeah yeah they go

243
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,039
together really well that's awesome yeah

244
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,078
yeah so where did you come up with it so

245
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,958

00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,838
salt like 10 pounds at a time and

250
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,078
dumping it in the tub because actually

251
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,560
when you go to one of those fancy

252
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:59,399

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,639
effect it's so relaxing yeah it's

268
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,759
interesting cuz like you hang out with a

269
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,679
lot of you know couples and maybe the

270
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,120
guy or the girl is a really heavy

271
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,120
consumer and the other person is not the

272
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,879
one who's the heavy consumer gets in is

273
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,360
super relaxed has this wonderful time

274
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,159
the one who has you know is cannaboid

275
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,399
deficient their body like sucks it up

276
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,159
and they and they turn into a noodle so

277
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,440
it's just so interesting kind of like by

278
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:56,039
soaking in it your body will take what

279
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,560
it needs right yeah that's the beauty of

280
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,838
it yeah totally yeah have you experiment

281
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,599
with strain specific using different

282
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,399
genetics or do you feel that pretty much

283
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
across the board with the cannaboids

284
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,440
you're going to get the same results I

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
think that so THC definitely makes a

286
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,639
difference um but you know we have 10

287
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,199
pounds of arnica salt and we have some

288
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,680
people that buy six of them at a time

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,320
and I think to myself wow this person is

290
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,359
dealing with chronic pain and these

291
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,278
baths really must help right so um the

292
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,600
CBD ones are very effective as well it

293
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,838
does like translate well but the THC

294
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,920
hits really different if you're into

295
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,480
feeling sedated and relaxing or maybe

296
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,559
you're dealing with anxiety or severe

297
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,399
pain sure yeah really cool yeah so yeah

298
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,879
and then with om you guys have done all

299
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,519
kinds of other stuff as well Edibles and

300
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,200
yeah you've won awards we have you're

301
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,278
working with whoopy for a while yeah we

302
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,480
we were so we did let's see I mean I've

303
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,399
done everything over the years um

304
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,320
hundreds of thousands of hard candies

305
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,720
you know probably a couple hundred

306
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,839
thousand peanut butter puffed rice

307
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
truffles throughout prop 215 those we

308
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,040
were really famous for those they were

309
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,639
like I don't know if you remember

310
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,360
Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco but I

311
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,919
used to go get the 5 pounds of organic

312
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,200
peanut butter there and then the go to

313
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,958
get the puff brown rice and hand dip

314
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,839
them in Belgium milk chocolate they were

315
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,759
just so heady and strong it was like two

316
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,440
for five bucks wholesale you can't beat

317
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:22,519
that yeah it was a total different era

318
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,440
um $40 now exactly I know isn't that

319
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,839
wild um so so yeah now now we do mostly

320
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,760
bath stuff but we did like I said bring

321
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,560
back our gummies so out of all the

322
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,879
things you've made what's your favorite

323
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,638
besides the bath salt or besides the

324
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,879
Epsom salt

325
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,440
so well it would be a draw uh would be

326
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,480
the love bomb which is like this all

327
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,519
over topical SL Lube that we make that's

328
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,079
like five natural ingredients wow yeah

329
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,198
um the love bomb or our gummies I went

330
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,759
really far down the gummy Wormhole yeah

331
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,120
I wanted to get into it cuz I saw the

332
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:58,120
potential because I I I love gummies I

333
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,240
love the you know and gummies as far as

334
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,600
with cannabis them I think that's just a

335
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,159
game changer and it's so appealing to

336
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,639
everybody that people that wouldn't

337
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,319
normally smoke they see a gummy and

338
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,879
they're like ah you know like my mom I

339
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,760
could be like Mom try this gummy whereas

340
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,799
I'm not going to pass my mother a joint

341
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,639
right that would never happen and

342
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,000
there's so many different ways you can

343
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,198
make a gummy there's so many different

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,839
recipes you can make them vegan you

345
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:22,919
don't have to make them vegan you can

346
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,360
you know there's there's a million

347
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,599
different ways to make them and there's

348
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,759
some really good ways and some really

349
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,759
bad ways it's so true and so um you know

350
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,120
when was the last time you put a gummy

351
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,240
that you didn't like in your mouth like

352
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,759
you might try another brand or flavor of

353
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,240
gummy but you're not going to put that

354
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,319
exact one back in your mouth yeah most

355
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,919
likely right you know if you really

356
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,800
didn't like it so you know you start

357
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,919
with your kind of pad diffu texture more

358
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,639
like a galet yeah uh you can get nice

359
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,399
and firm and bouncy that's something I'm

360
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,680
really into I want her to like talk back

361
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,198
to me so my gummy talks back but she's

362
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,879
pecked in right so she won't melt you

363
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,078
know won't melt

364
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,000
it form and I'm not opposed to a gelatin

365
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,078
gummy like I enjoy them I'm really not

366
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
opposed I

367
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,679
just I don't like the Haribo really

368
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,800
necessarily the hard ones where it's

369
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,919
like a lot of che where they get stuck

370
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,758
in your tee like Swedish fish like this

371
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,719
I actually like Swedish fish but I don't

372
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,360
like like if like I like Swedish fish

373
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,600
for whatever reason they're nostalgic I

374
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,639
like Swedish fish but that doesn't talk

375
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,680
back it doesn't bounce back to you right

376
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,639
I know yeah yeah so I can go so granular

377
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,919
down these gummy wormholes one the

378
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,240
potential for flavors that you put with

379
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:38,599
gummies I mean you can do teas you can

380
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,839
do all kind Earl Gray C meal with sugar

381
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,440
and and you can also blend those with

382
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,839
berries and all kinds of I mean it it's

383
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,800
endless it's like a Choose Your Own

384
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,560
Adventure and I mean that's I used to be

385
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,159
a chef so like I get really excited

386
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,559
about talking about flavor combinations

387
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,278
and there's so many different flavor

388
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,439
combinations that work really well

389
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:55,519
together and then you take something

390
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,199
like a gummy and you can do a million

391
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,078
different flavor coms it's so true it's

392
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:03,159
like a Frozen little bite yeah

393
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:04,638
experience totally so cannabis wise yeah

394
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,958
what's your favorite thing to

395
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,159
smoke so so I love dabs um I do a lot of

396
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,838
non-solvents I'm like I judge the

397
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,278
non-solvent um category for the emerald

398
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,639
Cup every year so rosin and bubble has

399
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,879
rosin and hash yeah so good yeah it's

400
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,799
the most lovely time of year for me it's

401
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,559
like having a little extra part-time job

402
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,599
it like it's you got to little you know

403
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,758
carve out a little time for that cuz

404
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,639
it's couple hour meetings and we just

405
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,079
wrapped that up actually and that was

406
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,278
fun yeah I think it's maybe my eighth

407
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:37,719
year doing that wow so who won I'm

408
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:39,198
kidding I know right I could tell you

409
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,839
the number but I don't know the company

410
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,479
cuz it's actually blind that's really

411
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,560
cool yeah so flower and hash are blind

412
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,360
but like topicals and Edibles are not

413
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:51,278
sure um so I find myself smoking a lot

414
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,959
of hash uh out of I do the puff Co it's

415
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,039
honestly it's going to sound terrible

416
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,518
but it's kind of like a little out of

417
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,399
laziness not okay laziness maybe isn't

418
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,198
the right word I'm busy I'm doing stuff

419
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,399
all the time like you know my hands are

420
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:07,359
always in something and so th that works

421
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,399
for me cuz I don't have to sit down and

422
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
commit a lot of time of heating my torch

423
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,278
and right all the acutron that goes with

424

and I said um when we had weed like this

473
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,240
we didn't have hash like this which

474
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,239
makes me a very lucky girl that's

475
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,798
amazing because I got to go in a time

476

silver tiny balls and washed it into the

480

nicest hash right that was really

481
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,400
special experience for me totally

not seen GDP in a long time that's like

485
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,320
the purple GDP yeah no one grows it

anymore well you know the reason yeah

487
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,200
because it Veges I used to so I used to

488
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,679
grow it and it would veg for 31 days and

489
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't want to it also tests around 12%

490
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,120
so this Market is so percentage based

491
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
you know but but you have a tummy ache

492

494

498
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,960

purple it was purple floral gas oh

500

well we're gonna start off by smoking

514

some some Z okay yeah I mean we live in

515
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,519
an amazing time we got to experience

516
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,918
really good flower back in the day I

517
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,158
mean it sounds like we're from the same

518
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:04,440
era where yeah prop two 15 third floor

519
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:08,000
Harbor Side BPG yeah uh PCC in in

520
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,080
Berkeley off Telegraph and all the all

521
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,480
the traditional guys I mean everybody

522
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,480
was traditional back then even the guys

523
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,480
that sold it to dispensaries it wasn't

524
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,400
like the license gross right and amazing

525
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,558
flower uh amazing genetics and just as

526
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,919
good as today in my opinion and more

527
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:27,399
variety of genetics I feel like there

528
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,240
was more diversity right so like yeah

529
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,798
there was way less

530
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,480
strain names but there was the diversity

531
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:37,879
was as far as genetic diversity there

532
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,798
was the ha a lot more Haze back then uh

533
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,240
a lot more hybrids too that were

534
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:45,639
distinct hybrids it's funny someone gave

535
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,120
me um you know a jack Herrera cross duie

536
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,200
the other day and I you know I'll be

537
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,959
honest with you I can appreciate Jack

538
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,400
herrer but I know that's not like going

539
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,120
to give me the effect I want I know

540
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,559
that's not my medicine of choice you

541
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,479
know so I was like oh let me just try it

542
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:02,319
for like old time sake this is nostalgic

543
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,919
and it was you know kind of early and

544
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,038
everybody's always saying Jack herrer or

545
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,799
sativa it actually was a super flat down

546
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:11,158
or high for me I was like o opposite so

547
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:13,278
there was so many back in the day there

548
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,159
was lots of different Jacks yeah I like

549
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:18,759
the Jack Flash yeah that was my favorite

550
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,400
my friend CJ from high school his

551
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,720
parents used to grow it and it was they

552
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,400
brought I believe they brought the seeds

553
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,240
back from Sensei seeds in Amsterdam and

554
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,679
it was amazing but there was Jack like

555
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,079
the Jack Herrera is different than the

556
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,640
Jack that I see today it's very linear

557
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,639
and very

558
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,278
like uh lyine and not a lot of

559
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,320
complexity to it and I remember the Jack

560
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:41,599
back in the day having a lot of

561
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:44,558
complexity and also would get you ripped

562
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,119
did you ever go to um kenam Medcare at

563
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,519
pken Suter with the Giant Buddha

564
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,439
downstairs I don't think so anyways I

565
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,359
used to work there for a period of time

566
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,600
as a bud tender also and that was

567
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,240
definitely an era we were I mean we were

568
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,959
paying 42 for purple yeah 4200

569
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,159
to times were different back

570
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:10,159
then missed those things yeah I know so

571
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,200
and I mean I think that just just the

572
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,039
guys you know when you're growing in a

573
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,840
garage as opposed to growing in a

574
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,720
warehouse you're putting more attention

575
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,158
into those plants people are getting

576
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,000
more per pound for it but uh pretty

577
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,960
amazing some of the stuff that we got to

578
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,558
see the cat piss back in the day was

579
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,079
like my favorite yeah uh but sour and OG

580
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,240
it's like dude the the OG was it would

581
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,918
you smoke it down to the roach it's Pine

582
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,558
yep it's lemon it's Pine it's it's got

583
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,480
that little hint to Citrus but it was

584
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,200
like gassy and not like chem do gassy it

585
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,038
was like OG gassy which is very

586
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,120
different to me I'll forever and always

587
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:49,640
be an OG girl myself I just love love

588
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,959
those gases more than anything in the

589
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,360
world yeah oh yeah and actually to be

590
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,840
honest with you the first thing to kind

591
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,399
of like make a wave I think since like

592
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,038
cookies and the gassy stuff has really

593
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,440
been um white Thorn Rose to tell you the

594
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,519
truth there hasn't been a unique new

595
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,720
profile in town so white Thorn Rose and

596
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,158
I've I think I've talked about on my

597
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,400
podcast before but uh as far as what I

598
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,400
love the effect of it and it's Feelgood

599
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,919
weed it makes you feel great and then so

600
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,798
my friend Dave has this blue 13 cross

601
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,240
that was like uh Louis the 13th for he

602
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,879
got it from

603
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,159
JRE uh at Wonderland Nursery back in the

604
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:33,159
day uhhuh and from Kevin jrey and then

605
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,919
he crossed it to his blueberry Haze and

606
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,679
it is incredible it tastes very

607
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,880
different than white Thorn Rose but it

608
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,720
has the same effect like literally

609
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,039
interesting has that same like you smoke

610
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,558
it and you just feel really good and

611
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,679
that white Thorn Rose if you smoke it in

612
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:50,158
extract I got some from Bella Heritage

613
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,240
yeah yeah and some of her rosin and that

614
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,559
stuff just it's purple freaking tastes

615
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,240
ABS so pretty and then the Rosen pens

616
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,678
I've I've got Rosen pens of it that are

617
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
just just like I don't want to share

618
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,000
them with anybody because it tastes so

619
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,799
good and it makes me feel great um but

620
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,798
yeah that's a fun and you can smoke that

621
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:11,079
day afternoon evening whenever and it

622
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,679
just makes you feel good yeah and so

623
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:15,359
that is what changed my ethos in

624
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,080
breeding in the last two months because

625
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,079
I've been so fixated on Flavor right how

626
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,359
does it taste how does it taste how does

627
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,480
it I'm I'm constantly asking people how

628
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,398
it tastes instead of how it feels and I

629
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,720
realize that I'm on the wrong track

630
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,239
around 420 when my friend passed and so

631
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,000
now what we're doing is we're going back

632
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,960
to like how does it make you feel and I

633
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,720
think we're going to prioritize that a

634
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,440
little bit more and flavor is going to

635
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,159
come along with that too but I think

636
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,200
that's a it's a valid question like how

637
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:45,720
does it make you feel we're talking

638
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,159
about medicine even though you're using

639
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,640
it recreationally how does it make you

640
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,039
feel oh 100% yeah even when we use it

641
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,960
recreationally I would just point out

642
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:56,679
that I think it's still rooted in some

643
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,880
type of wellness and healing yeah

644
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,240
totally when we pick our winners you

645
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,480
know for judging the emerald cup I I

646
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:08,000
just noticed at least Within Myself you

647
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:11,120
know there's never um a hash that blows

648
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,398
my mind for flavor yeah that didn't also

649
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:17,599
blow my mind on nose yeah so sometimes

650
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:20,079
there's a great nose and not a good

651
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:23,079
flavor but there's never an amazing

652
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,480
flavor without a great nose yeah that's

653
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:29,119
one thing I have been able to I've seen

654
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,839
so so with Pho hunting yeah Sometimes

655
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,639
the best ones are not the loudest ones

656
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,918
they have a good nose but I what what

657
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,480
I've seen across the board is sometimes

658
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,960
the best ones aren't quite the loudest

659
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,798
because sometimes the loudest ones are

660
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,159
the best ones Skittles is like that you

661
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:45,879
squeeze it you smell it it's amazing

662
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,200
it's loud but some of them are like more

663
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,120
subtle on the nose where you're like ah

664
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,519
it smells pretty good um like purple

665
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,398
punch is the opposite purple punch has a

666
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,558
great nose like I think when you squeeze

667
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:57,239
the butt it smells pretty good but then

668
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,319
you smoke it and it's a big let down and

669
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,200
it tastes like cardboard tur yeah you

670
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,678
get one hit that might taste okay and

671
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,679
then the rest of it just tastes kind of

672
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,399
bland yeah charcoal charcoal yeah like

673
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,200
you're just smoking a plant yeah um and

674
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,479
so I'm not a huge fan of that I want I

675
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,919
want it to taste down all the way to

676
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,079
taste good all the way to the roach or

677
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,520
when you fire it back up the next day

678
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,079
you're like whoa that tastes amazing

679
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,359
yeah and then after you hit it if the

680
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,158
flavor sits in your mouth uninterrupted

681
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,240
until you interrupt it you'll be tasting

682
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,120
like whatever it is exactly yeah and if

683
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,759
well with dabs too like where it's in

684
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,319
your teeth right so like you could uh it

685
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,158
could be half an hour later and you kind

686
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,720
of just move your mouth around you're

687
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,480
like whoa I still taste it still taste

688
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,640
it this is what I've been smoking on

689
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,599
this is so yummy is actually from from

690
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,919

00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,240
that's awesome yeah Skittles is great

695
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,880
yeah absolutely do you have this new

696
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,720
thing I do not

697
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,000
I have to say it like it really did make

698
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,240
a huge difference it was a game changer

699
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,919
so yeah I got the new ays from uh Focus

700
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,000
V do you like it and I like it it's it's

701
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,840
like an upgrade to a pen I feel like you

702
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,240
get more of a real hit from it um and

703
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,359
it's portable and it can fit in my

704
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,798
pocket so I could like load it up and

705
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,359
take it around and oh it's little it's

706
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,879
yeah it's uh it's about that tall and it

707
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,398
has kind of like a round top right okay

708
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,679
I know yeah yeah and it works good and

709
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,839
it's just like it's like a big fat p oh

710
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,640
that's

711
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,798
awesome but yeah I mean dabs have come

712
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,840
so far from having to use hot knives

713
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,720
yeah and and or charcoal yeah so yeah ex

714
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,839
chase the dragon yeah one of our mutual

715
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,079
friends uh Micah back in the day we used

716
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,079
to smoke on charcoal and you'd light the

717
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:49,879
hookah charcoal up yeah and then drop it

718
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,439
on there and tube and you'd hit it yeah

719
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,840
chase the dragon we used to do that I

720
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,519
used to set that up at the club for

721
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,240
people oh yeah and so that was like the

722
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,759
pre that was before we had dab rigs

723
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,399
that's how we used to smoke it we had

724
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,398
BHO and that's how we used to smoke the

725
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:06,398
BHO and we had butter you know yeah

726
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,879

00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:13,759
and Madison yeah and that flavor just

730
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,240
sits in your mouth it totally coats your

731
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:19,158
mouth yeah yeah I love that and it's

732
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,880
complex I like complexity I feel like

733
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,799
stuff that's just very linear like if

734
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,640
it's just blueberries or it's just lemon

735
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:28,798
or it's just orange it doesn't do it for

736
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,480
me yeah uh Agent Orange

737
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,839
for the most part I've I've tried a

738
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,159
couple different fenos of Agent Orange

739
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:38,519
over the years but agent orange you know

740
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,159
from subcool now that was very linear to

741
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,480
me and then I went to House of coltivar

742
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,200
in Washington and they had some agent

743
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:48,319
orange that was like the most amazing

744
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,558
complex like hits on all these levels

745
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,558
and it was amazing so sometimes

746
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,359
phenotypes have a huge play in that but

747
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,319
uh yeah it's like and I'm not a huge

748
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,359
orange turp guy but like I like

749
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,558
everything I like everything in in the

750
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,398
right moment I like everything I even

751
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,359
like blue dreams from time to time oh

752
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:07,239
yeah I mean BL dream yeah oh yeah

753
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,000
absolutely and if you're around 15 years

754
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,278
ago you got to see really amazing Blue

755
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,679
Dream yeah yeah exactly lots of it it

756
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,679
was everywhere when there was like that

757
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:15,798
little like Trend going around where

758
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,440
people were trying to put down blue

759
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:19,879
dream I was like first of all it's weed

760
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,240
oh they still hate on it and second of

761
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,278
all I guess you weren't in prop 215 when

762
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,839
it was really cracking then cuz we were

763
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:31,480
making lots of progress and success with

764
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,879
blue dream and before everybody had it

765
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,759
it was the thing to have and it was in

766
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,559
high demand and then we can blame Ed

767
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,119
renthal and a couple other people

768
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:41,678
releasing they bashed it down no they

769
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,639
released the cleanser oh man maybe it

770
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,360
was Ed maybe it wasn't I'm not sure but

771
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,640
but Ed did sell clones back in the day

772
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,398
and uh he sold a lot of clones but yeah

773
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,519
Blue Dream as soon as it got out

774
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,918
everybody shared it with everybody did

775
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,640
so much yeah and everybody wanted to

776
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,440

777
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,038

778
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,679
those ones like if you want and I would

779
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:02,919
used to tell people beginner Growers you

780
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,960
should grow that if you're growing for

781
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,240
the first time don't grow OG Kush even

though you love smoking OG grow Blue

783
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,798
Dream see how you do with blue dream

784
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,200
first exctly and uh I mean I used to

785
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:14,798
love growing and it was the first thing

786
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,440
I got over two pounds that and sour I

787
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,839
used to get two pounds of light now

788
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,080
that's like nothing people are like I

789
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,918
get four pounds but uh back in the day

790
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,398
two pounds like if you hit two pounds

791
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,759
everyone else was getting one and a half

792
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:28,000
pounds uh you were doing really good

793
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,359
exactly yeah Blue Dream does make people

794
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,119
look like good Growers because it's like

795
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,158
kind of blue and silver yeah not that

796
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,879
not too many hairs right and you feel

797
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,399
really good about yourself it finishes

798
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,600
and it's chunky and it's yeah you know

799
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:40,278
the cut that used to go around and

800
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,558
there's I think there's a lot of s1s

801
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:43,960
that have floated around since and I

802
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,278
think a lot of the people that have Cuts

803
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,960
now have s1's I mean there's a handful

804
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,720
of people that still have the real deal

805
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,399
but I don't see a lot of the flower

806
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,679
that's like the same stuff that we had

807
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:56,038
that was like super sticky absolutely

808
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,440
and I mean it was it was a it's as far

809
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:01,398
as like structure and Vigor and and a

810
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,759
lot of the the boxes that are to be

811
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:05,959
checked it was the apical of all of them

812
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,440
back in you know I agree it looks so

813
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,919
beautiful and you would open a pound bag

814
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,880
a turkey bag you open that back in the

815
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,960
day and it was like wow what is this

816
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,000
especially if it was the first time you

817
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,558
ever saw it absolutely so I know it so

818
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,240
that in AFU I don't know if you remember

819
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,440
AFU oh I remember afang go for sure yeah

820
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,798
so we used to get I mean the sweet AFU

821
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,159
was so amazing the first time I saw it I

822
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:31,038
was like this is fake there's no way way

823
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,840
that there could be this much sugar on a

824
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,079
plant yeah I always saw that I I've

825
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,918
always smell a almost like a bread dough

826
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,759
a yeasty bread dough on Afghan goo that

827
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,120
was a good medicine strain too it was

828
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:44,960
good IND heavy yeah it was Heavy it was

829
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,319
heavy and it looked just crazy like my

830
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,480
friends used to grow it it looked like

831
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,200
they had sprinkled tricomes on it and I

832
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,440
was like there's no way this is real

833
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,960
like absolutely so remember the old

834
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,360
school like hash plant that was all

835
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,480
garlicky smell like onions oh yeah that

836
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,798
wasn't turpy

837
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,480
necessarily uh it was kind of bland as

838
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,720
far as turpins go but it did smell

839
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,200
Savory it was like Savory and it was

840
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,919
like super mild not an exp on the no but

841
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,330
it was almost GMO harsh you know how

842
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,560
flat GMO can be like almost like

843
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:17,559
[Music]

844
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:23,398
harshyne Burger GMO and how that's

845
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:26,120
evolved into the extract scene like yeah

846
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,759
heavy I like garlic hash yeah that's a

847
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:31,199
really good high yeah really strong the

848
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:33,440
flower GMO my friend Marlin went through

849
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,080
this phase after like he was a OG head

850
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,720
and that's all he wanted to smoke only

851
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,000
OG I had a lawyer back in the day and I

852
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,319
had Marlin and those two people all they

853
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,398
wanted to smoke was OG Kush like

854
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,918
literally Marlin was like where's the OG

855
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,319
I used to be the OG guy and I love OG

856
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,200
that's how I met Marlon Asher back in

857
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,720
the day was from OG so and then he went

858
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,000
on this GMO kick and that GMO kick

859
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,960
lasted a little bit but it's so strong

860
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,038
and so I was like gmo's cool I prefer

861
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,440
sour yeah yeah but G more stimulating

862
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:04,720
more stimulating and that stuff would

863
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,399
you know you would be high yeah super in

864
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,558
the extract too dabs of GMO done yeah I

865
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:11,839
love sour I love a good Sour Diesel

866
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,158
myself yeah yeah and it's funny because

867
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,678
I feel like some people it gives them

868
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,240
like the couch lock for whatever reason

869
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,720
productive it makes me productive but it

870
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,880
makes me it's another one that makes me

871
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,759
feel right absolutely so yeah all those

872
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,200
chems I feel like the chems the gassy

873
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:30,519
chems were always good I you know OG's

874
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,360
too absolutely so let's talk about the

875
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,079
state of the industry all right what do

876
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,839
you think about everything that's going

877
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,638
on right now with cannabis in California

878
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:43,038
when I look at the Cannabis space right

879
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:45,479
now I see opportunity yeah yeah it took

880
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,638
me a minute to come back to this MH I

881
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,919
had my little you know moment in the

882
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:53,398
corner yeah I had my timeout right

883
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,720
totally even though it wasn't ever

884
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,199
really a timeout but you know what I'm

885
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,919
saying like well there was a time where

886
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,960
it was like what's going on here like

887
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,440
and I feel like we're so new to the

888
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,919
whole industry is new yeah and so

889
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,838
there's there's no balance there's no

890
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,000
solid foundation with everything that's

891
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:14,199
going on we it's it's this time where

892
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,639
it's like what's happening next right

893
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:19,199
and and we didn't know I think that's

894
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,559
scary that can be very scary so we you

895
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,519
know we're here in California watching

896
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:28,759
New York at their wave and yeah you know

897
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:30,119
it's so interesting so um

898
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,359
gosh there were you know remember when

899
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,639
all that Canadian money was around and

900
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:35,039
all the LPS coming down by and

901
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,119
everything yeah like it was so fun so it

902
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,039
was like I kind of feel like the way M

903
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,679
played it was like we didn't take on you

904
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,599
know too much money yeah um that's the

905
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,960
best you know what I mean and so here we

906
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,800
are these years later like still totally

907
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,519
like chugging along you know but it's

908
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,119
we've switched distributions a bunch of

909
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,719
times we've switched manufacturers a few

910
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,960
times I mean it's been rough out there

911
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,559
and if I if wasn't completely in love

912
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,000
with weed I definitely would have given

913
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,880
up yeah um but it's one of those things

914
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,599
where it's like you can't see yourself

915
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,200
giving up you know so right you just got

916
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,599
to keep fighting I'm just totally still

917
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:13,199
here and I've just shifted my

918
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,880
perspective and it feels really good to

919
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,078
kind of like shift my expectations a

920
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,640
little bit cuz when I step back and take

921
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,960
take what I thought I was going to get

922
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,239
out of there yeah I'm actually really

923
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,358
blessed you know and lucky like people

924
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,439
use our products you know we people

925
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,920
every month people use our bath products

926
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,960
and they bring people relief and I came

927
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,320
for that juice you know I came for that

928
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,639
juice and that nectar gratitude living

929
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,440
in gratitude I am Greatful you know and

930
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,279
so you know cannabis is a female Spirit

931
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,000
like water is a female Spirit like can

932
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,880
you find anywhere in nature where

933
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,239
there's a 90 degree angle in a body of

934
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,680
water no river or lake has a COR a

935
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:52,479
corner you know so we take water and we

936
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,960
put it in these 90° angle pipes right

937
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,400
and we're kind of like changing the

938
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,318
programming of this like energy you know

939
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,559
so so I kind of feel like that's what we

940
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,719
did with cannabis we took it from like

941
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,799
the feminine the open the free cuz like

942
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:08,439
cannabis is this forever giving generous

943
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,880
plant like yeah you use the scraps and

944
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,200
then you can like use the scraps again

945
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,838
and then you can use the roots and the

946
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,960
seeds and it's just this everg giving

947
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,759
non-discriminatory like compassionate

948
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,079
everg giving thing you know that she

949
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,079
doesn't want you to weigh her before you

950
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,519
throw her away and block your flow

951
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,240
because you have to track every bit she

952
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,358
says there's more than enough of me just

953
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:31,279
take me you know so in the spirit of

954
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:34,799
that plant kind of shoving it into this

955
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,040
90 Dee compliant right for me there was

956
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,519
always this disharmony you know and I

957
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,960
can feel that because I'm on the super

958
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:43,440
feminine side of it right so I as as

959
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,358
crazy as it sounds I there was a part of

960
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,440
me that had to disassociate a long time

961
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:52,159
ago like seven years ago and

962
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,400
um and now I just see it for what it is

963
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,239
so like we do CBD like we do all kinds

964
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,280
of things I Always Forever make medicine

965
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,078
I make Rick Simpson Oil like I always

own way as well as as well as this like

968
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:06,559
compliant Market because we've come so

969
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,519
far like why would I give up now you

970
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,400
know absolutely I can't see that you

971
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:15,318
know so so I get it and once my reality

972
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,200
came to reality I understood that you

973
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:22,000
know there's no one coming to save us

974
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:23,639
right this industry is challenged and

975
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,719
most other people probably would have

976
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:27,000
given up you know cuz like sometimes if

977
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,118
I feel like I'm going backwards it's

978
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,119
like no actually you're still going

979
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,720
forward it's not a circle it's a spiral

980
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,480
because you know what looks like success

981
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,679
today is very different from what I

982
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,280
thought I would have been getting five

983
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:42,719
years ago right right so all all that to

984
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,000
say this I feel grateful I'm fine I I

985
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,799
understand it now I understand

986
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,679
everything now um we actually let our

987
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,280
permit go we got the first one in

988
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:54,358
California we decided to let ours go um

989
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,440
maybe two years ago now we were at a

990
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,239
crossroad it was like okay we're good at

991
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,760
manufacturing we've scored 100 on our

992
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,598
tests like we did all the things you

993
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,520
know we had the Standalone building in

994
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,800
Berkeley it was like beautiful you know

995
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,159
that's how we got the first one is

996
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,519
Berkeley let us through right and um but

997
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,519
you have to realize with that comes

998
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,199
managing employees workers comp right a

999
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,039
lot of robberies started happening you

1000
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,799
know you might be following the rules

1001
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:19,239
with security but it could be easy to

1002
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,599
still break in you know we're a bunch of

1003
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:24,118
girls yeah so I I kind of found myself

1004
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,920
at a crossroad like I could pick up

1005
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,240
other brands to manufacture for and like

1006
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,400
really be a manufacturer you know or I

1007
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,199
can just focus on being a brand and work

1008
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,680
with a manufacturer so we decided to

1009
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,399
actually do that nice and yeah and it's

1010
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,799
I actually I I don't feel like I made

1011
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,280
the wrong decision I really feel good

1012
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,720
about it um everything still takes work

1013
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
it's not like when you choose that route

1014
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,519
your work is done as an entrepreneur

1015
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,200
it's really not like that at all you

1016
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:49,519
know some of some of it it's the work

1017
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,078
just starts to begin you know what I'm

1018
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:55,000
saying it's like you're still doing all

1019
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,760
the things so like um I will say that a

1020
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,599
lot of people think people in cannabis

1021
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,960
are just like living some sloppy easy

1022
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,079
life you know and it's a grind we need

1023
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,159
to break more than anyone like all my

1024
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,599
poor cannabis friends I'm like we bro

1025
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:11,000
you need a vacation like we need to

1026
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,240
we've been saying it's not boss girl

1027
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,679
it's Moss girl summer and like really

1028
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,279
time to kick it back you know these

1029
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,239
hamster wheels go on forever their

1030
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,560
wheels they they're made to spin forever

1031
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,879
and so like sometimes you need to jump

1032
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,239
out yeah well you grind is Relentless

1033
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,280
and yeah and like want to I want to get

1034
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,159
more for doing less at this point and

1035
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,599
when you hop into these vibrational

1036
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,039
hacks right where all the money in the

1037
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,440
world is already out there and it's a

1038
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,159
frequency so like how do I tap into that

1039
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,400
station and like just divert it over

1040
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,799
here for like really doing less or like

1041
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,920
right or like what would I do with my

1042
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,599
time for free right now how can I figure

1043
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,639
out a way to like make abundance out of

1044
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,200
that you know so right just a lot a lot

1045
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,838
of Shifting um a lot of Shifting in

1046
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,358
terms of you know like every bu we've

1047
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,519
been going through Rapid growth these

1048
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,440
last 10 years for sure yeah so much

1049
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,079
shifting it's been wild and it's not

1050
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,880
stable by any means it still has a long

1051
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,599
ways to go before the market stabilizes

1052
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,599
but we're seeing I mean the light of the

1053
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,440
tunnel is there I know it's there and I

1054
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:18,838
can see it I'm still gon to just put one

1055
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,760
foot in front of the next I feel like uh

1056
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:22,920
what you said really resonates with me

1057
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,760
that nobody's going to come save you you

1058
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,200
really got to do it yourself if you

1059
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,359
don't like the way the laws are written

1060
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:30,879
change them right make effort towards

1061
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:32,880
that if you feel like your business is

1062
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,599
failing do whatever it takes you know

1063
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,599
you sometimes you just got to suck it up

1064
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,838
and do you know wake up the next day and

1065
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,318
do the best you can do and go one more

1066
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,920
day and live one day at a time if you

1067
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:44,679
have to or another good example like

1068
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,960
everyone's talking about this recent law

1069
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,318
that they're talking about passing you

1070
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,960
know this Federal legalization or

1071
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:52,119
decriminalization whatever you know and

1072
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,760
and it's like okay I get it okay you can

1073
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,280
choose the Fear Factor timeline or you

1074
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,319
can understand that like this plant has

1075
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,000
a gravitational p and like when you're

1076
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,838
with her and in alignment like the doors

1077
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,599
just seem to open so like trust your

1078
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,400
flow there's going to be a place for you

1079
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,359
you know not everybody that's going to

1080
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,358
come here is going to be monsters

1081
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:10,960
there's going to be good people

1082
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,920
everywhere just like everywhere in life

1083
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,039
so we just got to trust that we'll get

1084
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,358
in where we fit in well yeah and if you

1085
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,159
take away your ego and allow you

1086
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,279
yourself to be driven by Passion I think

1087
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,719
that's where you're going to win

1088
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,400
especially with the plant 100% you know

1089
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,759
and if you love The Plant like I love

1090
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,800
the plant like you love the plant you're

1091
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,040
going to be successful and you're going

1092
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,000
to Pivot or you're going to do whatever

1093
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,239
it takes to be successful and totally

1094
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,920
and it's just I I'm just so grateful

1095
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,318
that I'm here I'm so grateful that I get

1096
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,680
to have this podcast that I get to

1097
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,318
interview people like yourself and we

1098
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:42,159
get to talk about cannabis and we're

1099
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:45,519
recording the oral history of cannabis

1100
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:50,559
and it's just so amazing

1101
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:52,480
2024 like 2024 and it's just amazing

1102
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,559
that we're able to be in this industry

1103
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,519
that's growing and evolving so fast and

1104
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,559
it's like surfing a really really really

1105
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:03,318
big wave and I love surfing that's

1106
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:06,639
awesome yeah I know totally um I think

1107
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:08,920
for the right people this is a a time of

1108
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,000
opportunity and excitement there's lots

1109
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,960
of opportunity out there and and it can

1110
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,599
be scary yeah but there's plenty of

1111
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,599
opportunity and and you know whether

1112
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,680
it's genetics I mean there's the Fear

1113
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,000
Factor you were talking about though

1114
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,799
there's a lot of people with that Fear

1115
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,119
Factor like oh you know I'm this is only

1116
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,839
going to happen for another couple years

1117
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,519
we don't know we don't if you're still

1118
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,199
here now just keep going seriously at

1119
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:32,759
this point just keep going and keep on

1120
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:36,039
fighting yeah U and I feel bad I'm glad

1121
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,680
that I'm not into flower production yeah

1122
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:39,318
I'm so glad I'm on the genetic side of

1123
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,279
it because I think those people have it

1124
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:43,480
worse than anybody the price keeps

1125
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,839
dropping and then we've got guys that

1126
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,838
are able to get their cost lower so

1127
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:48,440
they're charging less and it's just

1128
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:50,159
charging less for better quality product

1129
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,639
and every year the product gets cheaper

1130
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,440
and better quality for cheaper and so

1131
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,480
it's real tough being a cultivator right

1132
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,480
now and I feel for those guys out there

1133
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,920
absolutely on the commercial level and

1134
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,079
people that have invested their whole

1135
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,480
life into that and they're like well

1136
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,000
what do I do now well there's other

1137
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,920
things in the industry uh but yeah I

1138
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,639
mean I love the genetics I think it's

1139
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,159
amazing being able to cross breed so

1140
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,239
many different things and now s you know

1141
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:19,920
taking a step back and looking at what

1142
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:21,558
my goals are and what do we want for the

1143
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,480
future what do I want to leave is my

1144
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:27,240
legacy for especially for cannabis what

1145
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,159
is my legacy I mean I wrote a book that

1146
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:31,759
that's great but it's more than that

1147
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,118
it's the genetic side and I feel like

1148
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,599
now that I'm older I can really kind of

1149
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,559
focus on like okay well what am I

1150
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,838
leaving behind for everybody absolutely

1151
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,200
and the plant is beautiful like that

1152
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,279
whatever you put in it gives back to you

1153
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,679
absolutely I I'm got like a really

1154
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,280
awesome veggie garden you know every

1155
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,919
year I try to have a veggie garden now I

1156
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,160
can't imagine my life without one and

1157
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,159
this year it's just knock on wood just

1158
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:56,039
so homegrown vegetables it's so much

1159
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,519
better you know and it's like whether

1160
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,079
it's tomato you just can't get that kind

1161
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,318
of stuff from the store and it's also

1162
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,920
that you put the love into that plant

1163
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,358
and you put the time and energy and so

1164
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,119
it has your energy so you're eating a

1165
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,039
byproduct of your energy and that's just

1166
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,119
so amazing also like you know there's

1167
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,880
cannabis Laden throughout the garden

1168
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,400
like there's just it's all interwoven

1169
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,480
exactly where it should be amongst the

1170
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,240
lavender and the chamomile and the chard

1171
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,800
and the kale and the Watermelons and the

1172
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:25,318
pumpkins and the zucchinis like they're

1173
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,680

learning where his food comes from and

1178
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,639
we get to go out there and we're lucky

1179
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,599
enough to pull something from the garden

1180
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,199
pretty much every day um and just you

1181
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,838
know having cannabis plants around just

1182
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,679
raises the vibration like feels so good

1183
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,400

mama and I I definitely feed people you

1253
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,760
know is my love language so for years

1254
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,199
I've been like playing with this event

1255
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,800
in my mind and it's like it's an

1256
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,118
honoring of women in cannabis nice yeah

1257
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,920
and it's an

1258
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:29,400
intentional uh like clever menu with

1259
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,240
with a hash pairing oh nice yeah for

1260
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,880
each course nice where you smoke yeah so

1261
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,959
so like yeah we're going to smoke our

1262
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,079
weed and eat our food instead of eating

1263
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,720
the weed I'm not I'm not really into the

1264
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,680
whole eating the weed thing I think that

1265
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,399
that's great save that for at home I

1266
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,039
save that for at home and maybe once in

1267
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,599
a while like someone has an infusion

1268
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:50,599
dinner whatever that's cool for them me

1269
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,760
I want to smoke my weed and then eat my

1270
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,280
food and I love amazing food and I love

1271
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,720
amazing weed and paired together they

1272
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,240
can be absolutely amazing but just the

1273
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,318
whole thing where you want some turps

1274
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:03,318
and some you know 10 milligrams but I

1275
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:04,800
feel like if you eat it with the course

1276
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:06,480
I want to feel it now I don't want to

1277
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,039
feel it after I'm done eating and then

1278
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,358
I'm like oh I feel great wor about

1279
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:14,480
getting home yeah exactly and I love the

1280

1285
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,920
of them right like yeah especially

1286
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
cannabis with people that like food like

1287
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,400
that's a great one where you can talk

1288
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,440
about good food because there's so many

1289
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,639
good restaurants out there and

1290
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,119
there's restaurants everywhere in the

1291
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,118
whole world like doesn't matter where

1292
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,200
you go there's good restaurants and I

1293
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,200
feel like there's good restaurants

1294
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:45,279
everywhere if you know where to look I

1295
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,759
agree 100% And you know anyone who wants

1296
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,319
to have a restaurant should find a way

1297
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,319
to let people smoke weed because we'll

1298
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:52,239
order like three times as much totally

1299
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:54,400

1300
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,959

different fenos of it too for me it's

1307
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,439
got to be expando it's got to be smooth

1308
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,798
if it's not smooth I don't want to smoke

1309
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,519
it well the thing I like about really

1310
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:21,960
good cereal milk is it's creamy and it's

1311
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,000
gassy and it's got a little candy Floral

1312
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,720
in it and it's like it's so it checks it

1313
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,159
really checks all the boxes it's

1314

00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,679
amazing it's not quite candy but it's

1336
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:23,480
sweet like citrusy sweet and it smells

1337
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:27,919
hazy where you get with the haze but

1338
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:31,000
like funky okay I have to check it out

1339
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,159
sound sativa like malao that's one of

1340
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,239
those ones that makes me feel good like

1341

red Congo in Malawi yeah really good is

1342
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:42,279
really strong red Congo makes me feel

1343
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,680
good and happy and laugh and then deran

1344
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:48,760
just KCK kicks my head in the dirt where

1345
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,679
I can't talk yeah I'm so high it's like

1346
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,640
and it doesn't have a ceiling all those

1347
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:53,960
all those stengths all those different

1348
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,199
African genetics I feel like they don't

1349
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,358
have a ceiling to where you can keep

1350
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,838
smoking them and you get higher and

1351
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:00,358
higher Skittles there's like a a line

1352
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:02,000
here and it just doesn't get me higher

1353
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:03,759
than this it'll get me high but it

1354
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,960
doesn't get me higher than this where

1355
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,520
some of those equatorial longer

1356
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,920
flowering ones you smoke them and they

1357
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,318
just keep getting you more High more

1358
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,838
high you can smoke them for hours and

1359
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,199
you're still going to get more high that

1360
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,199
sounds awesome I haven't gone like super

1361
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,279
deep on

1362
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:22,558
those but I'd like

1363
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,480
to yeah there's not a lot of people here

1364
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,920
growing up yeah it's mostly take so long

1365
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,639
because they take so long and and

1366
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,519
they're so tall and they're so tall you

1367
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:33,480
need a specific type of room to and

1368
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,159
genetics are rare and the people don't

1369
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,519
share the genetics yeah like those kind

1370
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:38,358
of things I mean I think you could

1371
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:40,000
probably get seeds of them fairly easy

1372
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:42,519
on the internet right and you know hunt

1373
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,960
your own but people are lazy they want

1374
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:46,519
clones so because the seeds are out

1375
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,119
there the ace genetics they sell some

1376
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,000
good stuff you can search all over the

1377
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:53,640
Internet and find pretty good stuff um

1378
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,599
Aladdin from Khalifa genetics he sells

1379
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:59,279

1384
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:11,079
amazing so we were together on the

1385
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,760
connect Community event in Barcelona

1386
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:17,720
yeah and she has an opinion and she's

1387
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:20,079
very well spoken yeah and I'd love to

1388
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,480
get her on my podcast talked about yeah

1389
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,079
she's amazing and so like we hit it off

1390
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,240
there and then she's I mean I have no

1391
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,760
problem in debating stuff and some

1392
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,838
people don't like debating right but I'm

1393
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,079
willing to debate stuff how I feel about

1394
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,078
stuff and I'm okay that you have a

1395
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,400
different difference of opinion and I

1396
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,000
think that's great when we can have two

1397
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,599
differences of opinion talk about it and

1398
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,039
maybe I'll see your side a little and

1399
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,559
you'll see a little bit of my side and

1400
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,679
then we're like okay well this is how it

1401
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,480
is now right and so I mean I'm okay with

1402
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:49,159
trying to change people's minds and also

1403
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,679
having people try to change my mind and

1404
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:52,159
so not a lot of people these days are

1405
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:53,879
like that I feel like in the last 10

1406
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,239
years people have become so soft they

1407
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,798
don't want to hear another opinion

1408
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,519
they're like no that's wrong right and

1409
00:52:57,798 --> 00:53:01,000
uh we missed the good old debate so did

1410
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,358
you have a debate with

1411
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,559
her we well we were talking about sativa

1412
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:08,159
a

1413
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:11,079
genetics and

1414
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,078
uh yeah yeah I mean it and it was just

1415
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:14,599
good it was good I feel like no bad

1416
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,480
vibes you were able to just speak like

1417
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:19,640
civilized people and say each other's

1418
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,318
side and yeah and I think she gets the

1419
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:23,798
whole passion for the sacred plant thing

1420
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:26,599
and I think not everybody does

1421
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:27,960
yeah some people it's it's either over

1422
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:29,480
head or they're not into that or

1423
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,639
whatever but like I'm always about the

1424
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,199
sacred plant and I feel like the plant

1425
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:36,598
has given so much to me uh the reason

1426
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,039
I'm here is because of the plant

1427
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:40,359
absolutely you know and I've put a lot

1428
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:41,838
into it but I've got a lot I've got more

1429
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:43,358
I feel like I've got more out of it than

1430
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:46,279
I've put into it a lot of times and I'm

1431
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,798
just so grateful it's crazy that you

1432
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,000
know we could do the things that we've

1433
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:52,559
done and end up here now in the present

1434
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000

1435
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,040

feel that energy and it's like those are

1473
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:24,880
the kind of things that have brought me

1474
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,038
back to what am I doing breeding for

1475
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,200
flavor even that's great it's great and

1476
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,720
I love the way weed tastes but like

1477
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,078
let's make some feel good weed again

1478
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,439
well theirs doesn't lack flavor no not

1479
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,079
at all but but it has a noticeable

1480
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,920
feeling I feel like that some of the

1481
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:41,400
stuff that I you know it's like they all

1482
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,599
have different effects everything has a

1483
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,760
slightly different but the Feelgood weed

1484
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:48,480
from White Thorn Rose and Blue 13 is

1485
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,880
like it's different it's different it's

1486
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,760
not a it's you couldn't categorize it as

1487
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,079
a stimulant or as a narcotic right

1488
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,440
somewhere in the middle but it makes you

1489
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,440
feel great slightly

1490
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,760
sedative slightly but like I say

1491
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,000
stimulating and sedating it is it's both

1492
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,799
that's what I like about Kush it's

1493
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,400
stimul and my brain's going but my

1494
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:10,679
body's kicked back yeah so you've seen a

1495
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,760
lot of different OG kushes over the

1496
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,798
years I'm sure oh yeah yeah yeah lot

1497
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:19,480
there was that Diablo OG that was coming

1498
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:20,400
from Petaluma there was like syoma OG

1499
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:25,000
from those

1500
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:28,920
areas sfv oh I love SF I also like you

1501
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,079
know Khalifa Kush the Flow Rider OG yeah

1502
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,639
yeah so what's so so that Flow Rider the

1503
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,440
the the original the triangle cush right

1504
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,920
yeah it's like that was like the lime

1505
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,639
green bigger buds really good stuff had

1506
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,119
a little bit different of a high had a

1507
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,719
little bit different of they all some of

1508
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,358
the kushes can be heavier some of the

1509
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:48,358
kushes can definitely be heavier some of

1510
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:50,400
those highs can be a little flat for me

1511
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:53,000
yeah I don't appreciate a flat high

1512
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,960
right I I do want a stimulating aspect

1513
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,239
to it or else I'm just going to get tiee

1514
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,199
I just love pine needles when you can

1515
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,318
smoking you taste the forest oh yeah

1516
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:01,279
it's like there's something to be said

1517
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:02,759
about smoking the forest oh yeah I could

1518
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,160
I could talk about Kush literally all

1519
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:08,200
day every day yeah so special yeah and

1520
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:11,679
it's funny those OG's had different

1521
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:14,558
levels of Earth and so basically Earth

1522
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,318
Citrus and pine needles and you could

1523
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,760
get some that were really piny and some

1524
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,079
that were like just a little piny and

1525
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,400
then some that were super earthy and

1526
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,720
some that were mild in the earth and

1527
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,920
then some that were real heavy in that

1528
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:29,000
Citrus when that Citrus like sativa is

1529
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,358
uh uplifting I like those ones kind of

1530
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,159
getting more into the sour diesel Vibe

1531
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:36,598
exactly I like those stimulating sour

1532
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:39,159

chunky have you tried the Pluto no what

1543
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,119
is the cross um that's to be debated but

1544
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:13,318
it's definitely a gelato times a cake

1545
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:15,079
okay I believe all right I wasn't there

1546

00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,240
wouldn't do just one one of the things I

1562
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,960
really appreciate about you know a lot

1563
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:56,838
of the hashes are they're a lot of them

rose Hawaiian

1567
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:06,960
flow really refined floral notes can

1568
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,199
kind of only be captured when the

1569
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,119
plant's alive yeah so they come in late

1570
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:13,038
at night it's all swelled up they chop

1571
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:16,559
it out of element of surprise put it

1572
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:18,520
right on ice and a lot of those jars can

1573
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,519
capture you know stuff that you don't

1574
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:24,880
get any other way very volatile easy to

1575
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:26,880
disrupt flal not that only can be found

1576
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,160

like the the first one that we had

1619
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,079

it with like spaghetti over just like OG

1621
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,318
like back in the day that we had but the

1622
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:22,719
smoke of it was like your smoking

1623
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:25,960
something that's special yeah it was

1624
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:28,399
like definitely like uh little bit of

1625
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,079
musk and a little bit of bread and a

1626
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,400
little bit of gas and it was it was

1627
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,680
layer multi layer that top pissy top

1628
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,880
lingering pissy note that's so distinct

1629
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:38,679
like you're in a hotbox concert and

1630
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,559
somebody lights up a joint of cookies

1631
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:43,279
and it like literally grabs your nose CU

1632
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,960
it has one top note of Durban piss above

1633
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,480
all the others yeah and you goer smoking

1634
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,240
that smoking that cherry that is what

1635
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,719
you find in everything and that's what

1636
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,118
people love it's what brings the

1637
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:57,159
smoothness right you know the gassiness

1638
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:59,200
that top note so distinct yeah so like

1639
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:01,038
yeah for all that stuff it's like the

1640
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,679
the bread that's in wedding cake is like

1641
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:05,119
yeah people people are quick to forget

1642
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:06,759
but I don't forget I I cookies has a

1643
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,960
special place in my heart because I I

1644
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,599
was like there for all that and like

1645
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,920
yeah I was growing cookies and pink

1646
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:14,079
panties I was at you know the little

1647
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,480
pink panties was cool though when you

1648
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,720
grow so I used to I used to grow pink

1649
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,039
panties too and it would get black the

1650
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,358
plant was black the Clones were purple

1651
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,000
stem same thing Sunset sherbo but the

1652
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:24,679
the you know as a parent to Sunset

1653
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,719
sherbo or whatever the the cut that we

1654
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:33,159
had of uh pink panties I have jars of

1655
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:35,798
just purple stemmed clones yeah pictures

1656
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:37,239
of them yeah really cool before cookies

1657
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:39,960
there was really just OG was the queen

1658
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:42,598
of the mountain you know and cookies was

1659
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:45,318
the first cannabis strain to really

1660
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,039
changed the whole game yeah it was like

1661
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:49,400
there was so so for me I remember the

1662
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,319
Bubba and the master and the OG right so

1663
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,318
there was the Bubba cush and that was

1664
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:55,278
the top shelf that was like we didn't

1665
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:56,719
call it pre98 it was just Bubba cush

1666
01:02:55,278 --> 01:02:58,798
right and and then there was the master

1667
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:01,000
cush and it grew really strange it grew

1668
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,079
like fingery and it grew like side

1669
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,679
probably my lesser favorite of the two

1670
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:07,039
yeah to tell you the truth and the Hindu

1671
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:09,639
the Hindu from back wait that was that

1672
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,039
was first actually Bubba was so

1673
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:14,400
soapy Irish Springs in your mouth it

1674
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:16,880
totally was so you ever have a senen

1675
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,200
candy it's like it's like a a Chinese

1676
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,039
candy that like literally tastes like

1677
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:22,480
soap it was like so senen Vibes that's

1678
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,278
yeah bubble was that was the thing it

1679
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,199
was like straight soap and that's how

1680
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:28,278
you could recognize it in the thing is

1681
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:29,679
it grew I like the way it grows but if

1682
01:03:28,278 --> 01:03:32,079
you show me showed me a picture I could

1683
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,278
be like yeah that's it's so distinct the

1684
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,960
way that it grows and it was like

1685
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:38,239
shorter and the way that the the the

1686
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:40,119
leaves actually the pointed leaves they

1687
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,399
don't have serration on them and they

1688
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:46,119
kind of fold up so I would still put I

1689
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,838
would still put Girl Scout cookies above

1690
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:53,480
all those but neck a tie and same level

1691
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:55,798
as straight OG for me for me yeah like I

1692
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:58,679
like all those variants but they weren't

1693
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:01,079
you know I love the sfv and the Josh dog

1694
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:04,399
yeah and those two are like my jam yeah

1695
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:07,760
I like s sfv for sure yeah the the r

1696
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,480
whatever you Pine yeah sfv sfv is the

1697
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,680
pinest it's the pine yeah it is the it's

1698
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,199
like P other than that I want diesels

1699
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:15,038
but you know what I love about that pine

1700
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:16,318
needle is like you you smoke it and

1701
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,520
you're smoking it down to the roach and

1702
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,278
every time you blow it out you just

1703
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:22,559
taste the forest the pine needles like

1704
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:24,838
literally it's yeah and and so Josh

1705
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,200
Freeman he's from Sebastapol he taught

1706
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:27,358
me that you can eat pine needles I

1707
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:29,598
didn't know that they're really high in

1708
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,199
vitamin C and if you eat the baby pine

1709
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,880
needles as they're freshly growing they

1710
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,798
taste amazing and I'm like [ __ ] that

1711
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,000
tastes just like OG Kush the first thing

1712
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:37,358
I thought of when I had it I have to

1713
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,199
give that a try sometimes yeah so the

1714
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:41,358
fresh growth from the pine needles it's

1715
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,639
like Redwood or whatever I have to give

1716
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:45,639
that a try yeah really good all right

1717
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:48,078
tastes like OG Kush if you want to it's

1718
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:49,960
a reminder of OG Kush day I like that

1719
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,200
yeah if I could drink and eat OG Kush

1720
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,358
actually so well back in the day we used

1721
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:56,439
to make this um I learned a lot like

1722
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:59,078
over these years being taught and like

1723
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,240
one of the things was that that actually

1724
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:03,200
glycerin is really not a good solvent

1725
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:07,479
for cannaboids but it's an excellent

1726
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:10,278
solvent for Tarpin wow yeah so um you

1727
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,639
know making tinctures the old school way

1728
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:15,239
through

1729
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:17,558
glycerin uh with all these different you

1730
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:20,519
know strain specific

1731
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:23,039
batches really left you with like

1732
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:25,159
essentially a liquid flow you know like

1733
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,359
a liquid version of of the flower it was

1734
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:29,239
such a good capture of chirpin but but

1735
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:32,000
not a good capture of cannaboids

1736
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:34,199
interesting very and not healthy for you

1737
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,039
to smoke in your pants yeah we we were

1738
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,480
making like spritzers and stuff like

1739
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:38,440
cush sodas and stuff it was so

1740
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,760
interesting because it wouldn't really

1741
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,240
get you high but it would make your face

1742
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,319
start to sweat like there was something

1743
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:45,000
going on yeah like have you ever had a

1744
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:46,719
high turpine experience where your face

1745
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,119
kind of gets a little flushed abut it

1746
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:51,038
was doing that it's so weird CU it all

1747
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,079
lines up I was like oh my God I get it

1748
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:56,799
this was truly a capture of tpin yeah

1749
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,599
very interesting yeah it was really you

1750
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:00,960
know I guess kind of an accident I was

1751
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:04,079
trying to make something very strong wow

1752
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,599
but it was only strong in tpin

1753
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,839
interesting yeah really cool yeah I

1754
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:10,559
remember the ver the version 1.0 pens

1755
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:13,278
all had they Ed glycerin and they

1756
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,798
combine it and it was just so bad yeah

1757
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:17,760
blisterin just not meant to be smoked

1758
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:19,480
like that really yeah but yeah the

1759
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,000
industry's just come so far look at pens

1760
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:26,199
and now we have right now we have puff

1761
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,358
Co and we have a all these cool things

1762
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:30,798
so um so my girl

1763
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:32,480
Frosty she like hooked it up with this

1764
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:33,838
like special attachment or whatever and

1765
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,119
I didn't realize I like wasn't even

1766
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:37,599
living my best life without it wow and

1767
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,000
so she had to like put it in the app and

1768
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,640
all this stuff and so there's like a

1769
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,278
counter so like this is like the new

1770
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:44,879
color I've had it maybe like two months

1771
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:48,079
and ni anyways I had taken over 2,000

1772
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,519
dabs with it so far wow that's amazing

1773
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,278
yeah and I was like if I had this piece

1774
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:55,278
I would probably like have taken a lot

1775
01:06:53,278 --> 01:06:58,318
less because it makes it so much more

1776
01:06:55,278 --> 01:07:01,318
dab like like I've wasting my money

1777
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:03,679
totally that's really cool interesting

1778
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:06,639
huh yeah I mean the future we used to

1779
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:09,038
have the volcanoes Volcan I love volcano

1780
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,719
me too yum but once I figured out that

1781
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,640
you need one bag per flavor and it's

1782
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,439
better if you just keep reusing it for

1783
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:17,239
that same flavor it's better than mixing

1784
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,920
them all and they all end up tasting the

1785
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:21,399
same yum yum cat piss back in the day

1786

1802
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:56,598

1805
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,079
cuz like I'm up in like I said sebasti

1806
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:09,759
now and I just just literally like today

1807
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:12,240
saw two people biking like on a country

1808
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,000
road wearing masks like just no one

1809
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,598
around I've seen I've seen people by

1810
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,759
themselves in a car with the windows

1811
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,159
rolled up wearing a mask and I'm like

1812
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,479
okay well maybe they have Co want to be

1813
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,439
seen that's what I always think too I'm

1814
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:24,919
like I guess they must have it but I

1815
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:26,639
just don't think it's true they wouldn't

1816
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,838
be biking in a hot summer day it's like

1817
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,239
100° out no it's just can you imagine

1818
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:34,238
you're biking with a all your hot breath

1819
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,479
just pressing on your face yeah I mean

1820
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:39,599
you're getting your lungs stronger I

1821
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:41,358
guess yeah exactly that's wild yeah yeah

1822
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,560
I mean we live in a strange world it is

1823
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,279
a really strange World well there's just

1824
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,600
so many different realities going on at

1825
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,799
once yeah well everyone's got their own

1826
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,880
reality right so totally all these

1827
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:54,560
different perceptions of what reality is

1828
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,480
coming from different people and yeah

1829
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,640
and trying to understand

1830
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:02,198
people uh from an outside perspective

1831
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,679
instead of looking at just them straight

1832
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:08,479
on that's the best way right so and I

1833
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,640
love that about cannabis I feel like it

1834
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,479
makes me able to think of stuff from a

1835
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,159
different perspective sometimes totally

1836
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,919
well I think that's why some people have

1837
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:17,838
like really can't smoke cannabis is

1838
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,759
maybe they're not ready to look at thems

1839
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:21,359
yeah like my favorite Bob Marley quote

1840
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,640
is when you smoke the herb you reveal

1841
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,079
yourself to yourself you know and we've

1842
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,279
all been in the situation where you get

1843
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,640
in a little tiff with your friend you

1844
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,960
smoke a little weed you're like wow I

1845
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,079
was like out a line back there it really

1846
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:34,000
does show you the opposite side right

1847
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:36,600
you know it's a perspective shifter and

1848
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,198
like that's why you know I personally

1849
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,400
for me that's one of my tools but I

1850
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:43,879
always know I'm going to like Flip Flip

1851
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:50,399
my mind after I smoke on something you

1852
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:52,319
know um so yeah uh you know the Matrix

1853
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,439
is just these like tightly bundled

1854
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,520
belief systems you know like an example

1855
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:58,319
is we we all agree that we stop at red

1856
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,159
lights you know and if you break that

1857
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:03,679
belief you can go to jail yeah or even

1858
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,759
worse hurt someone but like everyone's

1859
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,719
going to think you're crazy yeah because

1860
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,440
you run a red light because it's a very

1861
01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:12,560
tight bundle of beliefs around traffic

1862
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:15,599
rules and safety in our

1863
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,719
society so we all agree to

1864
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,360
that well I there was a point where a

1865
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:21,239
lot of people more than half the

1866
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:23,319
population agreed that cannabis was bad

1867
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:25,000
for us right and it's like it's so

1868
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,880
strange you know and that but that was

1869
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,960
the reality back then they were like

1870
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,640
cannabis is bad you know reer Badness

1871
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,359
all this stuff and misinformation and

1872
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,239
miseducation and it's like it was it's

1873
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:38,279
so strange that we went that Direction

1874
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:39,919
with canis like if you think we've

1875
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:41,119
probably been using it not even probably

1876
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,520
we've been using it for thousands of

1877
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:46,559
years as medicine and then just in the

1878
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:49,679
last you know since the well since like

1879
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:52,400
the 30s and 40s they started you know

1880
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:56,079
making it look bad to everybody well

1881
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:58,000
such a cur all yeah they demonized

1882
01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:01,359
yeah they grows like a weed in our

1883
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,679
backyard so like cannabis can

1884
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:09,519
do what white willow bark does yeah and

1885
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:11,640
chamomile and lavender and colula but

1886
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,800
they can't all do what cannabis does

1887
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:18,079
right plant medicine Canabis does what a

1888
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,679
100 plants do exactly and it grows like

1889
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:22,319
a weed mhm it's their nightmare right

1890
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:24,399
there's no profit in it for them that's

1891
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,880
why they tax it so high yeah it's it's

1892
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:27,559
pretty wild

1893
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,440
and now but now we have the we have the

1894
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,600
majority at least agreeing that it

1895
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:35,119
should be legalized yeah I think big

1896
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,440
steps Little Steps over time that have

1897
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:41,920
turned into big steps so I feel like um

1898
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:44,039
two two things that really help people

1899
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,000
change their mind is either personally

1900
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:48,119
experiencing a cannabis Miracle or

1901
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,600
witnessing someone they care about yeah

1902
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:53,439
receiving a cannabis Miracle you know or

1903
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,560
benefit from Cannabis and at this time

1904
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:58,000
it's seated out enough that I think you

1905
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,480
know with Six Degrees of Separation

1906
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
people have been in touch with these

1907
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:02,959
cannabis Miracles and seen what these

1908
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,520
plants what this plant can do for

1909
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,600
totally straight edged people that were

1910
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:10,199
really even opposed to trying it

1911
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,679
themselves you know so yeah it's like

1912
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:12,759
you know we don't have a right I feel

1913
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,960
that we don't have the right to tell

1914
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,679
people as long as they're not hurting

1915
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,359
other people right what sort of plant

1916
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,560
medicine is good or bad for them they

1917
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,399
should be allowed to do as long as

1918
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,639
you're not hurting anybody else that's

1919
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:26,039
how I feel so you know um we have more

1920
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:28,319
than 200 cannaboid receptors in our body

1921
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:30,399
you only have eight opioid receptors

1922
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:33,000
yeah so they start under your tongue

1923
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:35,479
sublingual tincture right if I was God

1924
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,279
forbid on my deathbed I would hope that

1925
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:39,399
I might have a receptor for the medicine

1926
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:42,279
you may place in my mouth under my

1927
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:46,399
tongue it's not saying put this here

1928
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:49,158
yeah you know so uh for in my in my

1929
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:53,079
personal opinion I think it's our our

1930
01:12:49,158 --> 01:12:55,439
Birthright mhm yeah and pretty clearly

1931
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:56,880
uh clear to see that it's a tool that's

1932
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:01,158
been given to

1933
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:03,039
us uh to use to be well you know for

1934
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:04,359
sure I mean it's every it should be

1935
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:06,279
everybody's option whether you want to

1936
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:07,880
do it or not I'm not you know I'm not

1937
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:09,960
one to judge like that but like it's one

1938
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,440
of those things that it only makes the

1939
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:16,198
world a better place in my opinion me

1940
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:19,599
too yeah uh hungry happy rested side

1941
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:23,079
effects of cannabis right yeah yeah it's

1942
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,920
it's it's so fun it's it's pretty wild

1943
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:27,439
yeah so yeah and I mean alcohol it's a

1944
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,760
lot you it's funny thing with alcohol

1945
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,000
and tobacco they're both legal but they

1946
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,920
do a lot more bad than they do good in

1947
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,800
my opinion yeah so everyone has their

1948
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,639
own opinion on it but my opinion is that

1949
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,400
they do worse than or they do they do

1950
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:42,480
more bad than good I've definitely seen

1951
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:44,679
many people destroy them their lives

1952
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:46,638
from alcohol you know I've had my own

1953
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:48,079
little dances with drinking too much and

1954
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:50,679
all kinds of things

1955
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:53,279
and you know they call it a spirit for a

1956
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:55,119
reason and um and and trust me I love a

1957
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,399
little glass of wine here and there junk

1958
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:59,559
get me wrong I don't have to put it down

1959
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:01,799
to bring cannabis up but um but it's a

1960
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,440
really different vibration as far of a

1961
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,760
as far on the other side of the

1962
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,439
vibration Spectrum as possible totally

1963
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,159
and so I was talking about this at a at

1964
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,279
a dead and Company show a while back

1965
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:13,079
though and it was because you could see

1966
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:14,800
the vibration that people were on the

1967
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:16,519
people that were smoking weed or or

1968
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,639
whatever tripping yeah and then the

1969
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,440
people that were drinking had a

1970
01:14:17,639 --> 01:14:21,920
completely different vibration what it

1971
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:23,638
does is alcohol Tunes you out right

1972
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,600
whereas cannabis it's true and

1973
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:27,600
psychedelics they tune you in so they

1974
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,159
hyper you're able to hyper Focus or

1975
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,760
focus more and I think we all need to be

1976
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:34,879
tuned in a little bit more especially

1977
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,159
with music and sometimes tuned out of

1978
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,840
this Norm that we have and into the you

1979
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:42,279
know on the right frequency so I'm like

1980
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:46,279
really that's speaking my language so

1981
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:48,158
you know with the this time 2024 yeah

1982
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:49,880
you know it's not like a time we've ever

1983
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:52,439
seen before and it's never going to go

1984
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:54,199
back to whatever it was you know and

1985
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:56,198
it's this time where you know if you

1986
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:58,158
don't have a little bit of a meditation

1987
01:14:56,198 --> 01:15:00,559
process where any way that you're going

1988
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:02,599
in and connecting with your own soul

1989
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,760
yeah it's going to feel rougher and

1990
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,800
rougher you know for me I'm a spiritual

1991
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,079
person I believe in great spirit you

1992
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,440
know and if I didn't have that

1993
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,279
connection to great spirit and the faith

1994
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:15,238
that you know the things that I believe

1995
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:17,559
that the Universe has my back and

1996
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:19,799
frequencies and vibrations matter and

1997
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:22,600
all the things I really my my little web

1998
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,480
of beliefs you know then I would feel

1999
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,560
way more lost than I do already when

2000
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,359
everybody's feeling lost on some measure

2001
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,679
you know so um the thing is we spend so

2002
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,960
much time in technology that like you're

2003
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,880
kind of tuning yourself into the

2004
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,719
vibration of AI by being on your phone

2005
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,199
all the time like I do it all the time

2006
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,000
they do way too much they we use them

2007
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:42,158
for cameras calendars like everything we

2008
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,079
do you start getting highminded yeah and

2009
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:45,638
so you know you're tuning into to your

2010
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:47,238
to your cell phone over and over again

2011
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:49,079
you're getting on that AI Vibe but the

2012
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:50,718
truth is we're actually nature Spirits

2013
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:53,039
you know we're people we're humans of

2014
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:55,158
Nature and so people need to ground

2015
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:57,319
themselves more and I think that's one

2016
01:15:55,158 --> 01:15:59,559
right so if you go and lay on the ground

2017
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:02,079
like find a nice spot that feels good to

2018
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,000
you in the grass take your shoes off

2019
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:05,319
flip yourself like a pancake at least 20

2020
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,840
minutes on each side get your phone as

2021
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,198
far away from you as possible it doesn't

2022
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,440
matter if it's sun or shade wherever

2023
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:13,719
you're comfortable yeah when I do that I

2024
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:16,519
can feel the problems pulling off of me

2025
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:21,039
it just like gravity pulls it off of me

2026
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:24,040
right away and it's it's like a spa day

2027
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,519
and like some really effective therapy

2028
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:27,439
yeah and a whole bunch of other good

2029
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,679
things all wrapped into one and I get up

2030
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:31,238
just feeling like you know a new person

2031
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,000
yeah go do gardening with your shoes off

2032
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:34,519
yeah exactly that's when you're able to

2033
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,960
spend time in nature I I do cold

2034
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,480
plunging too and that's good I love cold

2035
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,679
plunging I love the idea of cold

2036
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:42,718
plunging yeah I think that everybody

2037
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:44,119
should try it I got to try that yeah

2038
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,760
it's it's so I'm sure the part of my

2039
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:49,238
brain is very small yeah I think like

2040
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:51,800
that I heard how it works like there's a

2041
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:53,319
part of your brain that you know grows

2042
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,920
when you make yourself do things you

2043
01:16:53,319 --> 01:16:57,399
don't want to do so the cold plunging

2044
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,719
literally grows this part of your brain

2045
01:16:57,399 --> 01:17:02,198
and apparently undisciplined people have

2046
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:05,920
like this very small part of this brain

2047
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:09,319
I'm like I bet mine is like so Pinner

2048
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,158
because I'm a lady I like to be Comfort

2049
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:13,319
yeah getting into a cold pool sounds

2050
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:16,479
like so awful to me to force yourself to

2051
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:17,639
get in freezing cold water yeah and so I

2052
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,678
went to the extremes where I went down

2053
01:17:17,639 --> 01:17:23,199
to like 37° now I'm fine it anything

2054
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:25,679
below 55 you get really good results so

2055
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:28,599
I'm like in the high 40s low

2056
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:30,239
whatever I enjoy doing it I feel like

2057
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,719
it's a great replacement for coffee in

2058
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:36,439
the morning it's a great way to also

2059
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:38,399
just get a different perspective and

2060
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:40,238
it's it's hard to be upset after you get

2061
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,559
out of coold plunge sure because you're

2062
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:43,839
so focused on in the it really other

2063
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,360
thing is it brings you into the moment

2064
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,360
and I think we need to do that a lot

2065
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:48,559
more than what we typically do we're

2066
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:51,319
thinking about the future we're thinking

2067
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,560
about the past and if you can once a day

2068
01:17:51,319 --> 01:17:55,639
just get in some cold water or meditate

2069
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:58,520
or do whatever it is right and then go

2070
01:17:55,639 --> 01:18:00,239
into the present you start realizing

2071
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,400
that the reality is different than you

2072
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:05,759
probably had the perspective for before

2073
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:08,158
right and uh it's it's really wild but

2074
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,920

yourself sometimes yeah it's funny yeah

2080

I got to change the order sometimes

2081
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:25,319
sometimes I'm like no actually I can't

2082
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,000
start work until I take my walk

2083
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:28,399
yeah you know my mind is too busy it's

2084

pulling me in so many directions if I

2085

2136
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:28,678
yeah so good so if you had one thing

2137
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,319
that you could tell yourself to your

2138
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:32,480
younger self that was first started out

2139
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:34,000
in the industry you could have if you

2140
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,158
could tell them one thing what would

2141
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,119
that thing be don't pay attention to the

2142
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:40,238
smoke and

2143
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:42,920
mirrors nice yeah there's so many little

2144
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:45,479
fear factors and like distractions and

2145
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:50,279
noise houses of cards that came tumbling

2146
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:53,000
down and you know just not nothing was

2147
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:54,719
really as it seemed so just like get

2148
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,439
really passionate about whatever it is

2149
01:20:54,719 --> 01:21:00,119
you're into and put your nose to the

2150
01:20:56,439 --> 01:21:01,879
grindstone and just keep going it's so

2151
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:04,479
funny that you say that because I feel

2152
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:06,359
like most of the things I thought when I

2153
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:09,319
was younger are not completely the

2154
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:12,039
opposite right but they're never as they

2155
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:13,519
seem perspective and perception are just

2156
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:14,920
these amazing things and you get

2157
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,920
perspective over time and then you

2158
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,800
realize wow like I think that suffering

2159
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,359
is not that bad like I think people

2160
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,800
should suffer to a degree so they can

2161
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,839
appreciate the good times right and like

2162
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:28,480
you I think that a lot of parents they

2163
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:31,679
don't want their kids to suffer or have

2164
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:34,279
a hard life and I think hard lives make

2165
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:36,520
some of the best people and appreciation

2166
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:39,039
for what they have and being grateful

2167
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,960
you get that from having tough times

2168
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:43,639
yeah it's true the pressure makes the

2169
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,719
diamonds absolutely and you really are

2170
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:47,960
just grateful for all that you have and

2171
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:50,520
and you also know what you have and what

2172
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:52,800
you had and the experiences really put

2173
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,040
life into perspective so every day you

2174
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,880
know I feel like as we get older years

2175
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:59,039
go by faster every year goes by a little

2176
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,880
bit faster because you figure a year

2177
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,119
when you're five years old is 20% of

2178
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:06,000
your life but right but a year when

2179
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:08,559
you're 20 is a 20th percent of your life

2180
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,560
you know 5 per. yeah so like you look at

2181
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:14,320
it like that it's as you're 40 that five

2182
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:16,239
becomes two and a half and so each year

2183
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:19,079
goes by so much faster it's all

2184
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:21,079
perspective and we think you know time

2185
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:22,920
we got so much time and really we don't

2186
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:25,119
I don't think this is the end as far as

2187
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,719
like existence but we have a finite

2188
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,559
amount of time to do all the things we

2189
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:30,760
want to do and there's no better time to

2190
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:35,520
do them than the present that's so true

2191
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:38,119
yeah oh yeah they say um so uh if you

2192
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,159
had the luxury of knowing that you were

2193
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:43,840
dying tomorrow yeah what would you do in

2194
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:45,599
your last 24 hours and then like now

2195
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,920
that's how you should live each day

2196
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,719
that's always an amazing question and

2197
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,920
you should ask yourself that every day

2198
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,359
yeah I know I would I would go make

2199
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:55,560
amends with

2200
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:56,960
like one or two people who make it's not

2201
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,280
that we're on bad terms but maybe we

2202
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,840
haven't talked but they're important to

2203
01:22:58,279 --> 01:23:02,158
me you know family I would make sure

2204
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,400
we're all good you know knowing I would

2205
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:07,399
never see them again yeah I mean I'd

2206
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:09,279
definitely go see my parents right I

2207
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:11,799
think that'd be the first thing I'd do

2208
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:13,920
yeah so I'm lucky I was raised by really

2209
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,639
good parents that's awesome great

2210
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,239
parents yeah me too you know we had our

2211
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,319
ups and downs and arguments and stuff

2212
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:22,479
for my parents were amazing still are

2213
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,079
amazing are they here I'm I'm blessed to

2214
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:26,399
have both parents still around that's

2215
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:29,119
great you know my dad passed in January

2216
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,599
sorry to hear that yeah that's tough and

2217
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:32,800
it's like I know that that's coming and

2218
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,360
that's as you get older like I

2219
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,079
experienced the loss of my dog which was

2220
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:37,639
one of the toughest things if you've

2221
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,760
never had that you probably wouldn't

2222
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:42,159
understand it but as we get older we

2223
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,360
start experience loss yeah and then I

2224
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,439
just I imagine you know that my parents

2225
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:48,000
are going to pass one day which they

2226
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:50,399
will everything passes right and so it's

2227
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,600
it's a trip when you think of those

2228
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,519
things and like what you would do with

2229
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:58,079
your last day right so yeah I have to

2230
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:00,600
say you know I'm grateful I spent so

2231
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:03,198
much time with him on his last you know

2232
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:06,320
on his last days on his last months nice

2233
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:08,039
so much time blessing it was a blessing

2234
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,759
I'm grateful because you can never ever

2235
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:12,158
get that time back no yeah yeah you

2236
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:14,520
don't that's the one thing is you don't

2237
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:15,799
get time back yeah you can go have new

2238
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,960
experiences but you don't get the old

2239
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,360
ones back it's very true yeah but it's

2240
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:22,119
all about bid memories anyway it is and

2241
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:23,639
it's also about like recognizing what

2242
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:25,679
are the moments from your past that are

2243
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:27,520
robbing you from your present right cuz

2244
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,920
those are the moments that should go

2245
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,239
yeah cuz they're just taking up real

2246
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,319
estate real estate in your own mind you

2247
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:34,718
know yeah that's what I love about

2248
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:36,559
psychedelics because I feel like we have

2249
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:37,760
these filters and I I call them filters

2250
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,960
but really some a lot of them are

2251
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,400
traumas but traumas create filters and

2252
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,399
all these experiences for the moment

2253
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:46,118
we're born we see the world as we see it

2254
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:48,519
now because of all these experiences

2255
01:24:46,118 --> 01:24:51,118
yeah our lenses these lenses right so we

2256
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,480
see this world in a specific our reality

2257
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:55,920
is this lens right and so when we take

2258
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:58,319
psychedelics we smoke cannabis I think

2259
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,000
sometimes it pulls those lenses or those

2260
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:02,639
filters off and so then you start seeing

2261
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,118
the world maybe not how as how it really

2262
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:06,079
is to everybody else but how it really

2263
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:07,960
is and how it should be right and I

2264
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:10,118
think like trauma is just such a bad

2265
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,039
thing and we've all experienced with

2266
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:14,519
each one of those lenses comes like a

2267
01:25:12,039 --> 01:25:16,039
whole different belief system right yeah

2268
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,040
and so a lot of them are limiting

2269
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:21,079
beliefs and those are what you have to

2270
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:23,880
let go of you once you see them you can

2271
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:25,719
let them go right in all kinds of ways

2272
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,039
that I'll tell you later but like you

2273
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:30,079
know I mean I can go into it now but

2274
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:31,880
I've just been doing this practice where

2275
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:34,079
you basically bring it into your heart

2276
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,800
yeah bring it into your heart yeah which

2277
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:38,679
is the tool of 5D you know used to be

2278
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,679
the mind and the mind wants all your

2279
01:25:38,679 --> 01:25:43,079
attention right but it's really all

2280
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,800
about the heart so it it the heart is

2281
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:47,399
such a high vibratory tool that anything

2282
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:51,039
you bring into your heart gets

2283
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:53,238
neutralized wow yeah so yeah so anytime

2284
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:55,560
you notice a limiting belief you know

2285
01:25:53,238 --> 01:25:56,919
and one way you can find out this all

2286
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,560
came from this woman I've been doing a

2287
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,520
coaching thing with one way you can find

2288
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,000
out what they are is you start

2289
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:05,119
describing yourself to like a best a

2290
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,600
friend like pretend there's someone here

2291
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:09,279
and start describing yourself and you'll

2292
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:12,800
start to notice these beliefs come up

2293
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:14,519
you know you might say something like oh

2294
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,880
yeah sorry I smoke a lot of weed I

2295
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,639
always forget stuff like that's a

2296
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,880
limiting belief that cannabis makes you

2297
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:22,359
forget things right you know and you

2298
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,440
pull it into your heart and then it

2299
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:25,479
leaves your life and it's not it's not

2300
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:27,879
holding you anymore it's like it

2301
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:29,279
neutralizes the contract wow and you're

2302
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:33,118

everybody in the cannabis has and we

Partners like I know she's from New

2351

Jersey that's like an important place

2352
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,319
for us to be definitely East Coast you

2353
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:40,480
know

2354
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:42,359
um of course California too but everyone

2355
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:44,279
who's been in California understands

2356
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:46,599
that there are some challenges with lots

2357
01:28:44,279 --> 01:28:49,079
of challenges you know yeah so sad you

2358
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,159
know yeah that was um one thing I did

2359
01:28:49,079 --> 01:28:51,760
want to say when we were talking about

2360
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,279
Spain and all the Social Clubs is like

2361
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,119
you know not to get political but I

2362
01:28:54,279 --> 01:28:59,238
really feel like Gavin Nome like dropped

2363
01:28:56,118 --> 01:29:02,000
the ball when he didn't let us have live

2364
01:28:59,238 --> 01:29:04,519
music and food and wine events and

2365
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,359
espressos with like our weed you know so

2366
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:08,000
there's just no we're not able to have

2367
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:09,719
that culture yet we have the best

2368
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,760
cannabis and the best wine and produce

2369
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:14,359
in the whole entire world yeah

2370
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,880
heartbreak literally the best heartbreak

2371
01:29:14,359 --> 01:29:19,759
you know we had the most potential to

2372
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:21,800
have such great cannabis tourism and

2373
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,199
farm totable Boutique Vibes and I think

2374
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,199
he said that he's against it it just

2375
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:27,960
wasn't written correctly was his cop out

2376
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:29,839
for it but it's like come on like

2377
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,679
whatever it is dude you dropped the ball

2378
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,199
like we could have been flowing by now

2379
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,440
you know could have brought a lot of

2380
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:37,879
money to San Francisco yeah and having

2381
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:40,238
Place places where people could consume

2382
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:42,480
and enjoy and enjoy other things along

2383
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:44,000
with it 100% and not be treated like a

2384
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:47,198
criminal right when you have to spend

2385
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,319
top dollar for some boofed out weed yeah

2386
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:51,000
that had to be like robbed of its Tarpin

2387
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:54,000
just to make it to market the compliant

2388
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,359
way mhm it's a heartbreak it's a

2389
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,198
heartbreak and I think we're solving

2390
01:29:55,359 --> 01:30:00,719
those problems as we speak like with

2391
01:29:58,198 --> 01:30:02,399
refrigerated distribution and delivery

2392
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,118
and trying to get the product to the

2393
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,559
consumer sooner because I think that's a

2394
01:30:04,118 --> 01:30:08,079
huge problem right is the consumer and

2395
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,239
some of these guys have amazing flow I

2396
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:11,079
was talking about this on my last

2397
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:12,279
episode but there's amazing flow but

2398
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:14,920
then you got to wait one or two months

2399
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:16,920
to get it and then it's not amazing yeah

2400
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:18,560
it's a boof process the boof process and

2401
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,319
they're boof aying The Weave I know you

2402
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,239
know Alec has a really good breakdown of

2403
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:24,759
that you know Alec from SC Labs you can

2404
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:26,399
explain that whole process so well it's

2405
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:28,920
very that's awesome I need to get him on

2406
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,158
the show yeah you do um you know I just

2407
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,960
feel like it would have been such a Vibe

2408
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:35,719
if you could like roll up to a farm and

2409
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:37,039
actually see un unmanicured weed in jars

2410
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:39,480
and then they bring out the little

2411
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:42,158
wooden tongs and like handic cure it for

2412
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:43,479
you and then weigh it up for you and you

2413
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:45,118
know that real nice Vibe where you're

2414
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:47,000
getting something fresh and farmed to

2415
01:30:45,118 --> 01:30:49,559
table like it should have been more like

2416
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,800
that right considering like a couple

2417
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:54,840
flakes of trim isn't anything anyways

2418
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,840
right you know to mic manage it like

2419
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:59,159
that just like blocked all the flow well

2420
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,920
I love the micro Brewery Winery model

2421
01:30:59,158 --> 01:31:04,198
that would be great for you know with

2422
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:07,359
the Terre yes in in Humble you know

2423
01:31:04,198 --> 01:31:09,479
Menino Sonoma Trinity like all those

2424
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:12,839
places and and you you know then you put

2425
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:15,399
the farmers back uh you empower the

2426
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,760
farmers to do what they've been doing

2427
01:31:15,399 --> 01:31:19,158
long before most the people that are

2428
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:21,600
doing it now and then you can experience

2429
01:31:19,158 --> 01:31:23,238
it with them and hear the stories of how

2430
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,079
their grandparents were Outlaws and

2431
01:31:23,238 --> 01:31:27,678
bootleg basically like bootleggers and

2432
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,399
had to fight for the plant and do stuff

2433
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,440
that they believed in even though it was

2434
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:32,279
illegal and now it's legal and those

2435
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:36,719

myself but that's what I love about the

you know not to go on and on on the show

but I love that about the recreational

2458
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:27,119
world and the Bel legalization of

2459
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,279
cannabis is that we can be Specialists

2460
01:32:27,118 --> 01:32:29,359
and I don't want to do everything

2461
01:32:28,279 --> 01:32:31,559
anymore I don't want to do tissue

2462
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:33,118
culture I have a partner that does that

2463
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:35,119
um I want to focus on genetics I don't

2464
01:32:33,118 --> 01:32:38,118
have to grow flower or be the guy who

2465

01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,079
right exactly beautiful we can really be

2468
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:44,799
Specialists and really dial those things

2469
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:46,279

2470
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,679

wrong sure sure but we did that CU we

2474
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:56,319
had to be private so we couldn't just

bring bring anyone in anywhere yeah it

2476

where we only hired friends and family

2480
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:12,960
because that was the only safe way to do

2481
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:14,279
it so to like step into these situations

2482
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,679
