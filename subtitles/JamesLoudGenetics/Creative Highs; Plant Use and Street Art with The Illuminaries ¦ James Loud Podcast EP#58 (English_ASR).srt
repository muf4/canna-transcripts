00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,839
train there as often as Tim does I

22

should be training more I'll be going

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,280

other day and this this is actually like

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,079
the other day like a year ago I was

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,439
rolling and it was uh the afternoon and

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,960
I was getting choked out and when I look

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,640
up at this mural I'm like man

29

called you and I'm like who's Tim and

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,599
then we kind of discussed it and so it's

35
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,599
a real small world I think the Jiu-Jitsu

36
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,199
Community is very small uh the Cannabis

37
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,719
Community is really small yeah and you

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,640

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
small it's uh yeah it's it's extremely

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,159
extremely small community yeah not our

60
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,878
it's it's crazy like we kind of just

61
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,719
fell into that niche of sports

62
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,679
entertainment it wasn't really like what

63
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,318
we meant it for it to be but it kind of

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,400
just steamrolled that way and you know

65
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,679
we just going with the flow of it how

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,560
how early did you start doing art as

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,879
early as you can remember um yeah I mean

68
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,519
I remember drawing a little bit uh here

69
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,039
and there I mean I my parents would say

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,200
I drew a lot I didn't feel like I was

71
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,799
drawing a lot but I would say graffiti

72
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,238
itself is what kickstarted me to draw a

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,680
lot because it was the point where like

74
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,400
oh man my stuff is published on a wall

75
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,360
now I better learn how to draw I used to

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,840
draw a lot but I feel I feel like I was

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,159
that good

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,799
until like graffiti kicked in so until

79
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,919
you picked up a spray can when I picked

80
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,719
up a spray can it was that was it man I

81
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,759
was was I and how about you Steve uh

82
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,280
kind of the same route you know like I

83
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,798
did my Fondest Memories of um drawing

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,680
was when I was a kid probably like six

85
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,719
years old and then all my little cousins

86
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,799
would come over and we'd always copy

87
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,400
these Garfield comics they had like

88
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,480
Garfield had like hundreds of different

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,239
types of comics and we trace it and see

90
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,119
who could trace it the best yeah so I

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,959
think just from there it was like oh

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,680
okay that's like you know I guess kind

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,000
of just jump started everything but when

94
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,799
I first met Tim I met him in high school

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
right and I was doing graffiti and he

96
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,239
was doing graffiti but we didn't know

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,919
each other we had like a mutual friend I

98
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,280
was like damn he uses spray paint I use

99
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:51,679
spray pain like it was just a matchmate

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,000
in heaven but [ __ ] pause no Diddy uh

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,040
but it just

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,239
like damn definitely not cutting that

103
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,919
out [ __ ] man no but spray paint like

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,360
transformed the way I approached art

105
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,119
just because it's you know that the tool

106
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,519
is a different type of tool so yeah but

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,280
just ever since we were little man just

108
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,438
drawing drawing drawing yeah I did

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
airbrush when I I did a lot of art when

110
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,199
I was growing up it was my mother was an

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,000
artist to she still is okay so I was

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
exposed to a whole bunch of stuff you

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,600
know everything from oil to watercolor

114
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,199
to airbrush I did aot I took airbrush

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,199
classes when I was younger that's as

116
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,120
close as I got to really graffiti right

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,680
right yeah you say you don't mess with

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,759
it no more I don't have time for that

119
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,639
yeah I I focus on the things I'm really

120
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,759
good at and try to take them to the next

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,439
level and maybe art will play a role you

122
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,439
know I feel like when I work with

123
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,199
designers like yourself I have my input

124
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,399
on stuff and I look at it from that lens

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,000
or I try my lens my version of that lens

126
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,439
like from an artistic lens uh and

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,879
sometimes with packaging and stuff like

128
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,360
that but I also have a partner who's

129
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,639
extremely artistic in some ways and he's

130
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,319
really good at layout and design and

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,038
making things flow together

132
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,439
and so I feel like I'm creative in some

133
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:06,519
ways and he's really organized and

134
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,160
creative and together it's like this

135
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,038
nice mesh right I that's kind of how it

136
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,600
works with me and him yeah it's great

137
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,279
having someone you can bounce ideas off

138
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,120
that are complimentary where it's not

139
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,799
like it goes in a different direction

140
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,038
it's like very complimentary and I feel

141
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,600
like with business which is 99% of what

142
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,879
I do is James L genetics and so I stay

143
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,919
focused on that and everything that I do

144
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,120
revolves around improving James loud

145
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,478
genetics or displaying James loud

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,120
genetics or the podcast that talks about

147
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,439
you know other people in the industry

148
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,800
that kind of highlights the genetics and

149
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,160
I feel like everything I do kind of

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,918
revolves around the business yeah yeah

151
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,800
how you do it art you know I'm glad we

152
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,959
were able to connect yeah you know and

153
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,520
just like taking your input in you know

154
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,719
and just making things happen so oh I

155
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,359
mean it's next level the James Loud logo

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
is next level I think everybody

157
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,439
recognizes it um and it's it's very

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
recognizable and distinct and people see

159
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,038
it they're like I recognize that from

160
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,079
somewhere and whether they recognize it

161
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,478
from James loud or from the 70s or from

162
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,359
whatever movie they got inspired by

163
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,879
right right you know I feel like uh it

164
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,240

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,000

326
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,560
nah hang up wow yeah but I mean it is

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,879
what it is man but yeah we ended up

328
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,439
doing a bunch of community service well

329
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,838
actually no is that the one where we

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,079
paid off that Chef no

331
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
comment bro we had to do hella hours of

332
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,958
community service and then we found this

333
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,278
chef and then he uh he owned this

334
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,759
kitchen and he just paid him 50 bucks

335
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:19,439
back then signed off all the hours day

336
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:21,679
though what per per day oh was it dang

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,800
okay but anyway we paid it off and I was

338
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:27,239
like yo I'm good nice like community

339
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:29,479
service is was terrible back then man I

340
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,120
mean I don't know how it is now but it's

341
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,360
probably not as fun yeah it just depends

342
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
on what you're doing community service

343
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,278
you know you can go work in a soup

344
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,679
kitchen it's probably not the worst okay

345
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,399
that pick up trash on the side of the

346
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,198
freeway that's not fun yeah that's the

347
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,519
one like um they'd warn you about

348
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,679
needles and just [ __ ] everywhere and all

349
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,000
especially these days it's probably a

350
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,679
lot worse yeah I can oh yeah I can

351
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,559
imagine right so what was it like

352
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,638
growing up in the Bay Area you know I

353
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,919
feel I grew up in the Bay Area too so I

354
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,839
I think it was amazing times we're

355
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,000
blessed we're all connected to the same

356
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,560
music industry the same

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,159
artists whether it's Grateful Dead or

358
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,838
whether it's hip hop rap we had amazing

359
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:12,319
music we had amazing

360
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:15,519
culture yeah man I think just the Bay

361
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,560
Area was to me it showed me how to be

362
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,078
independent like how to hustle how to do

363
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,879
things for for yourself you know don't

364
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:26,479
wait for nobody um but as far as growing

365
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,958
up it was just it was diverse man it was

366
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,120
like the Melting Pot you know you can go

367
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,159
to the city and see all this graffiti

368
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,440
you can go over here and just see all

369
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,078
the luxury or whatever you know it's

370
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,440
just like all different types of friends

371
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:46,000
and and like you said like cultures yeah

372
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,160
so to me it was it was beautiful man and

373
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,078
like when we were growing up just

374
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,679
graffiti was kind of in its own

375
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,198
Renaissance you know but I feel like

376
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,838
we're in another Renaissance now as far

377
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:58,479
as like bombing and and just [ __ ]

378
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,880
getting trashed man did you guys ever in

379
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,440
fact I know you saw it The Optimist on

380
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,958
the side of 880 that was there forever

381
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,720
oh never I think they even tried to

382
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,359
paint over it and then it rained a whole

383
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,120
bunch and then it came back what so now

384
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,440
it's gone yep yeah no it's it's yeah the

385
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,799
Bay Area back then for me was just like

386
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,639
a big playground you know like yeah

387
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,240
especially in the graffiti era I feel we

388
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,560
feel I feel super blessed to to be

389
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,839
growing up under like we had all these

390
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:29,278
Kings like above us like dream and

391
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,360
crayon and estria and all those guys

392
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,838
that they were just like we'd run into

393
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,079
them at the railroad tracks there was

394
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,959
like free range there we you know you

395
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:41,159
had Psycho City out in SF um just so

396
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,000
many like legal areas and the only only

397
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,399
downside it was very criminalized back

398
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,799
then but um it was just cool to to have

399
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,240
so much inspiration I mean I just

400
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:53,278
remember the first time like being super

401
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,360
inspired by graffiti is like you know I

402
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,720
walked into this train tunnel and just

403
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,278
it was like Florida ceiling all around I

404
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,800
was just like what the hell is this like

405
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:05,320
this is just a whole another world and I

406
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,719
had to figure it out you know so that

407
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,040
was just that was the lovely part about

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,959
the bay you know I had the East Bay San

409
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,399
Francisco side and in in that era it was

410
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,159
just like so much Innovation and style

411
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,120
and all that yeah it's pretty amazing

412
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,159
and same thing with food and same thing

413
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,560
I mean just art in general whether it's

414
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,399
food or whether it's even even wine like

415
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,479
the innovation in wine California is

416
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,440
very Innovative the Bay Area is very

417
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,000
Innovative we have so many great minds

418
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,839
thinking and I think you know you get so

419
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,360
many people together in an area people

420
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,720
start getting their minds working

421
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,440
together you get amazing things and

422
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,278
amazing things happen very true very

423
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,199
true and even like you know you move

424
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,559
like few blocks down you'll get a whole

425
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,120
different variety of you know whatever

426
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,318
culture and whatnot like Oakland versus

427
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,318
San Francisco to me is like very

428
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:53,799
different yeah you know and especially

429
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,799
as far as art too you could tell like

430
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:59,198
what style lives where or what not so

431
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,958
it's um

432
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,799
it's cool there's so many like sub

433
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,119
subcultures too as well so many

434
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,078
subcultures and so so much stuff going

435
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
on and there's always something

436
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:10,799
someone's always doing stuff that's

437
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,439
different and new and growing up in the

438
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,399
Bay Area and then transitioning what do

439
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,040
you guys is this your full-time career

440
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,159
now this is what you guys do yep uh full

441
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,838
full-time I mean full-time mirrorless

442
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,559
but then we also have our own businesses

443
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,600
side hustles and businesses yeah so um I

444
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:31,638
also run flavor innovator which is a

445
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,680
graphic design studio so that's more

446
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:38,360
focused on kind of like key art uh CD

447
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:41,120
music uh graphic design nice heavily

448
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,000
graphic design and typography work cool

449
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,198
what about yourself yeah I do software

450
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,120
development on the side wow and so I

451
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,719
have I have another business with my

452
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,639
cousin um and some other friends that we

453
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,680
we do uh we're in ISP out in the midwest

454
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,759
so I do software it stuff but yeah I

455
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,599
mean we're always faced with that you

456
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,919
know when you're in the art business

457
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,480
you're always that thing's over your

458
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:06,199
head like okay should I make the jump to

459
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,199
go fulltime and that was always clouding

460
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,640
me I guess for the first few years and

461
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,959
then I think at some point we had we

462
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,679
were at the CR crossing point where was

463
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,480
like okay we could do this fulltime is

464
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,559
this what we want to do and somehow you

465
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,279
know I just had we had the idea like why

466
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,279
or at least for me I was like why do I

467
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,119
want to make this a job you know

468
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,960
something like why would I want to ruin

469
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,759
something that have like the one thing I

470
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,960
have a big passion for do I really want

471
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,480
to make it my job and start doing

472
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,319
projects that I don't want to do and so

473
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,440
when we made that decision like no we're

474
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,798
just going to keep it as a side hustle

475
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,160
and so we have multiple side hustles

476
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:47,519
going on it's not a full-time thing and

477
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,240
so then we can just you know have the

478
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,679
luxury of saying no to projects and

479
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,200
stuff like that so right that's kind of

480
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,559
how it's gone where you don't have to

481
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,480
have it to keep the lights on and you

482
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,359
can do it just 100% passion driven right

483
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,279
Warrior stuff was pretty big I feel like

484
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,678
that you guys blew up maybe you blew up

485
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,639
before that but that's when I really was

486
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,679
like wow you guys are crushing it thank

murals too around the same time yeah I

490
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,079
mean that was kind of right place right

491
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,918
time for us um that the first one we did

492
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,038
was a one we did for for fun for Steph

493
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,080
that was the the M Dre it just happened

494
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,359
to go viral like the next day that was

495
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,000
just we got lucky there you know and and

496
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,000
that's what set you know we got on

497
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Steph's radar it took a year for them to

498
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,759
to like actually contact us and then you

499
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,279
know the ne then a year later then we're

500
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,759
finally working with Steph directly but

501
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:44,480
it was it was pretty amazing yeah and

502
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:47,119
funny story about that one was um so Tim

503
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,079
found this wall it was on 27th in

504
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,798
Northgate and he's like damn this would

505
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,519
be a dope spot a dope spot to go paint

506
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,558
uh Steph Curry miror or a warrior a

507
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,400
Warriors mural and this was what

508
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,240
2015 16 17 I think it was the first time

509
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,159
it was the first win when they started

510
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,720
really blowing up and jelling and it was

511
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,480
like we looked down and I was like hey

512
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,038
there's no Warriors murals anywhere cuz

513
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,679
they're in the playoffs already i' had

514
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,839
been eyeing this wall for anything I

515
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,080
didn't know what we're going to do on it

516
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,359
I just knew we had to do something cuz

517
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,279
it was right by the freeway there's

518
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,158
nothing on it well it was all graffitied

519
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,759
up and I saw a gardener out there and I

520
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,400
was like oh hey what's up can we paint

521
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,960
this he's like um I mean the owner isn't

522
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,080
even in this state so I mean you

523
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,279
probably could and and I was like okay

524
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,879
and we're gonna come back next week so

525
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,279
we come back and it's all locked up and

526
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I was like call him like uh how do I

527
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,079
what's going on he's like well just do

528
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,919
what you need to do and so I mean I had

529
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,359
the bolt cutters and we go in there and

530
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,759
so we just start painting it and like no

531
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:45,439
one's really messing with us so it was

532
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,679
technically a illegal mural and and and

533
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,038
then but suddenly like the the community

534
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,759
the neighborhood started coming out and

535
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:55,038
like giving us food and beer and they

536
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,519
were like oh my God thanks for for

537
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,839
transforming this corner cuz it was like

538
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,400
a drug Den before that and it was like

539
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,359
conted all this homeless and so like

540
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,798
that was the first time like it was like

541
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,519
a light bulb moment for me was like the

542
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:10,558
transformation of art into the community

543
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,679
I mean I know that's it's kind of cliche

544
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,918
like obviously but at that time I was

545
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,798
like whoa this really did transform this

546
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,679
entire and it actually cuz the literally

547
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:22,400
like a couple weeks later that spot

548
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,600
which had been vacant for like a decade

549
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,759
got rented out by like a car company

550
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,158
yeah to to use their lot so it it like

551
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,919
literally transformed that corner into

552
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,640
like a you know productive area that's

553
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,720
pretty cool yeah we helped gentrify that

554
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,559
help gentrify the area it's your guys

555
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,038
yeah you guys the ones doing it [ __ ]

556
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:45,960
just that whole that little moment um

557
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,400
even I think uh it got so popular that

558
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,319
when they won the championship they ran

559
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,600
the parade through there or no or did

560
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,399
they well the parade came right by there

561
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,240
but we threw our own party there

562
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,360
remember so we had we brought a DJ out

563
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,038
and then I mean police were showing up

564
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,240
trying to take pictures with it like we

565
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:05,359
had I think we had a few hundred people

566
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,000
out there partying um during the parade

567
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,158
yeah so that was a Monumental uh

568
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,038
experience that kind of just catapulted

569
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,679
us you know kind of again into that

570
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16,319
Sports and and entertainment Arena

571
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:20,000
really cool not intentionally just kind

572
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,839
of not yeah serendipitous I think is the

573
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,759
word serendipitous yeah I mean some of

574
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,798
these things just magically happen in

575
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,119
our lives that you're on the right path

576
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,400
and all of a sudden

577
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,119
next thing Steph Curry's calling you

578
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,038
guys up right you know or yeah or

579
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,000
whatever you know but yeah it's pretty

580
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,038
amazing subconsciously trying to

581
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,400
manifest it and works out man yeah

582
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:44,038
manifestation is an amazing thing yeah

583
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,360
i' been I've kind of

584
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:49,278
been like studying that or learning

585
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:52,038
about it like the past year I was like

586
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:55,319
oh this um who's there's this one guy uh

587
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:57,200
doctor Joe Espinosa or something or he

588
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,359
kind of talks about that

589
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,919
like man in like your feelings and your

590
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,240
your um your thoughts and actually

591
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,320
really trying to feel everything inside

592
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,839
your mind and body like that way like

593
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,519
let's say I want to be out in Italy or

594
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,319
something right if I can just in my mind

595
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,918
if I can think it but in my body if I

596
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,639
really feel I'm out there then it'll

597
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,120
manifest in some way yeah eventually

598
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,880
like subconsciously at a subconscious

599
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,359
level but well speaking of Italy and

600
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,120
Europe have you guys had a chance to get

601
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,199
out to Europe and seen the art out there

602
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,359
the street art the graffiti I mean I

603
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,120
think yeah he painted out there it's

604
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,079
pretty impressive yeah yeah no they they

605
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,839
like all the artists out there I feel I

606
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,278
look up to a lot of them out there or we

607
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,399
we do too so Barcelona's off the hook oh

608
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,319
oh yeah I mean it's I mean they really

609
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,798
took Griff Treet art to another level I

610
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:50,038
say in the there was a point where I

611
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,480
feel like you know it start baton was

612
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,400
passed to from the US cuz it was just so

613
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,720
locked down and criminalized here yeah

614
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,278
like really couldn't do much whereas

615
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,360
over there like you do whatever you want

616
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:03,119
and and so like they man yeah there's so

617
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,798
many amazing artists all over Europe

618
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,439
that you know just taken over it's

619
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:10,480
pretty pretty awesome yeah but I had the

620
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,120
opportunity to paint in Albania wow that

621
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,278
was super fun I I packed on my paint in

622
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,839
my suitcase and uh somehow made it

623
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:20,119
across over there and nice I knew

624
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,319
someone who knew someone who knew the

625
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:25,278
mayor of the capitol city in Toronto

626
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,759
Toronto Albania and then I just sent

them my portfolio and they're like yeah

628
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:29,679

629
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,480
building you want kind of and they're

630
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,240
driving me around the city showing me

631
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,400
like these huge like 10 story buildings

632
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,599
like n I'm only here for like 4 days I'm

633
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,200
going paint in two days so I picked one

634
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,359
that was like three stories tall and um

635
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,080
they assigned me like the a guy with

636
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,639
like one of those bucket trucks and it

637
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,158
was like it was it was so like touchy I

638
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,038
couldn't I felt like I was going to fly

639
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,039
out of it and so I actually had to have

640
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,079
a guy who didn't speak English like do

641
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:55,400
it for me on the ground and I'm in the

642
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,759
bucket and he's controlling it so I got

643
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,278
to like tell him where I'm going and oh

644
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,319

645
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,960
time say I painted a painted a painted

646
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,119
like twostory building a three story

647
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,200
building up there so it was dope what's

648
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,199
amazing how much paint you can put on a

649
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,840
building like like literally when you

650
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,200
did the the buildings you did Eric's

651
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,678
buildings before before the building

652
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,440
here and then you know I just saw how

653
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,038
much paint you guys did how long it took

654
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,798
yeah pretty impressive I mean how many

655
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,480
gallons for uh it kind of depends like

656
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,240
if you're using regular Home Depot paint

657
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,399
or if you're using spray paint yeah you

658
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,919
know know the the values change but um

659
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:37,398
what do you prefer oh spray paint spray

660
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,520
paint is the weapon of choice kryon uh

661
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:41,519
not kryon I wish there was still kryon

662
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:45,440
but now know that's crazy because when

663
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:49,278
we came up kryon and rum and even like

664
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,720
Orchard Supply was was our [ __ ] yeah but

665
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,240
now like and we kind of took a little

666
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,079
Hiatus probably what like 10 five five

667
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,120
10 year Hiatus and then we came when we

668
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,798
got back on the scene there was this new

669
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,959
spray paint Montana so that was a game

670
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,158
changer you know with like the pressure

671
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,960
like it almost felt like not really

672
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,278
airbrushing but it's like a low pressure

673
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,319
thing so you can get all these clean

674
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,960
Fades and whatnot and then plus with all

675
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:18,319
these different tips and caps and

676
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:22,640
adapter and all the colors Game Changer

677
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,000
W by Montana Montana 94 is my preferred

678
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
yeah and that's I mean that's example

679
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,798
the that's all the European companies

680
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,879
like they they changed the game with

681
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:31,639
their spray paint you know they cuz the

682
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,640
Kon is like came out like a fire

683
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,120
extinguisher right and then that

684
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,919
European stuff is like more like a

685
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,719
airbrush press it low pressure wow um I

686
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,080
think there's a US company in there now

687
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,600
Loop right but most most of the good

688
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,759
paint out there is not in from the US

689
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,839
European D but how were them fools using

690
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,319
the kryon back in the days like so clean

691
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:55,519
like they even back in the days they

692
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,759
used to get super clean characters with

693
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:02,079
this janky can you know is that SK right

694
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:05,278
there skills yeah Steady Hand skill y

695
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:08,678
move really fast too fast and smooth

696
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,119
yeah man LS like man so you guys see

697
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,320
that building in La that they recently

698
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:15,038
did he actually meant to go yeah he was

699
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,519
there you were there I was there after

700
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,558
the fact I wasn't there painting it but

701
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:22,038
I was I was there uh a couple weeks ago

702
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,639
and there's police around at 24/7 now

703
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:26,960
but I bet it's dude that thing just went

704
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,759
boom boom just quick dude yeah the

705
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,558
amount of days like yeah I mean huge

706
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,398
like this the the graffiti the level of

707
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,639
graffiti happening today is just

708
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:38,319
incredible like you know they're using

709
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,440
ropes they're repelling they're just you

710
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:45,200
know just don't care you know so many

711
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,480
you got Navy Seals doing graffiti W and

712
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,919
and they're working together now which

713
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,440
is I think a Monumental that building

714
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,278
you know the first one I think was in

715
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,000
Miami that they did that um and then La

716
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,319
was the second one but like I think to

717
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
me what was huge about that other than

718
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:02,918
obviously it's amazing is is all these

719
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,240
groups of writers that kind of normally

720
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,240
beef probably I mean at least when we

721
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,319
were there like all these different

722
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,278
crews are always beefing but this was

723
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,240
like a coordinated effort of all these

724
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:15,398
cats that maybe I don't know if they all

725
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,200
painted together or not I but I suspect

726
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:20,359
that you know they it was organized very

727
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,319
organized and they hit it all real fast

728
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,000
and like now it's just like every corner

729
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,398
that building is done so what do you

730
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,919
think the biggest contributing factor to

731
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:30,479
this evolution

732
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,520
is

733
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,759
technology uh I mean we've had the

734
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,879
internet for 20 years now but I feel

735
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:39,398
like

736
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,278
lately people have been using in more so

737
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:44,239
social media yes I think yeah absolutely

738
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:46,159
I mean social media I mean now you're

739
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,240
platform is way bigger than your city

740
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,519
you know like you got all the Drone

741
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,038
shots and people are just going bigger

742
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,798
and bigger I mean I mean saber aw yard

743
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:58,359
back in the day he did that huge one in

744
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:59,839
La that was like a the Guinness book

745
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,119
records right but now it's like people

746
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,439
are just constantly trying to go bigger

747
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,000
and bigger and scaling way up you know

748
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,919
so I think that is a big factor it's a

749
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,599
contest yeah man I love seeing like

750
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,840
people using all the rollers like off

751
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:18,158
the freeway yeah huge rollers and just

752
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,599
damn man you know part of it is like the

753
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,519
economics of like just the police don't

754
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,119
have time to patrol that anymore you

755
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,038
know it's decriminalized things to worry

756
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,158
about yeah and so now they just kind of

757
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,919
let it go so it's a free-for-all at

758
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,080
least Oakland Oakland is a free-for-all

759
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,840
Oakland is a free for-all Oakland is a

760
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,918
free-for-all the trains are free-for all

761
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:41,439
over there you know everything it's

762
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,159
stores your jewelry stores even yeah

763
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,798
even back then when we were doing it

764
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,840
there always was kind of like the hot

765
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,480
City that everyone knew that was like a

766
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,480
free-for-all you know it was New York

767
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,319
and then it was Chicago yeah and

768
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,079
different places in San Francisco for a

769
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,639
while and then everything gets locked up

770
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,599
and so it was Oakland but and then it

771
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,399
wasn't and now it's Oakland again you

772
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,319
know the last 5 years is just and like

773
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,239
having that having all that space for

774
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,639
people to paint you know and then and

775
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,278
then letting when it's decriminalized

776
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,919
letting people have time then the

777
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:14,159
quality goes up and so now you're seeing

778
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,038
a lot of right when you're not afraid of

779
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,799
getting arrested yeah or shot or killed

780
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,200
or whatever you know although Oakland

781
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:23,119
you got to watch out for brother stuff

782
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,319
you're not worried about the police

783
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,000
anymore now you're worried about getting

784
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,960
shot right it's a rough one you know and

785
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,440
it's sad because I've been around

786
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,440
Oakland a long time and it's the worst

787
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,558
it's ever been you know it was bad back

788
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,440
in the day and it got better and now

789
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:39,759
it's bad again just you know they

790
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,360
changed the laws and so people don't

791
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,720
mind robbing other people breaking into

792
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,158
their cars you can't leave your car

793
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,640
parked in Oakland doesn't matter what

794
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,240
your car looks like if there's anything

795
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,080
in your car they'll break your windows

796
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,120
and now they have those shattered the

797
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,599
the things that shatter so it like

798
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,038
instantly shatters your window they're

799
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,038
in and out in a

800
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,240
second you know and they have guys

801
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:01,000
driving just down the road looking in

802
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,839
every car seeing what they can get yeah

803
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
it's yeah man a [ __ ] like wild wild

804
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,278
west again or something yeah and they

805
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
just don't have enough police officers

806
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,839
to enforce all the stuff either you know

807
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,120
I mean like the real criminals they're

808
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,639
getting away with it yeah so you say you

809
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,518

811
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,038
know it's like I don't I'm I try to

812
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,559
avoid Oakland yeah honestly like if I

813
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,158
can avoid Oakland I do uh but I worked

814
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,319
in Oakland my you know on and off my

815
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,679
whole life seen the cooking everything

816
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:35,119
dude yeah it's and I love it I love you

817
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,080
know I love that Berkeley Oakland area

818
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,000
you know everywhere over there and

819
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,000
Oakland is special you know Oakland is

820
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,278
different than San Francisco yeah and I

821
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,599
love San Francisco for its for its own

822
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:47,359
thing San Francisco is amazing there's

823
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:50,038
there's

824
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:53,558
definitely diversity in both places but

825
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:56,398
they're very unique in their own ways

826
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,599
right very true yeah I mean this the the

827
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,518
pace of life in San Francisco is like

828
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:02,319
really fast right it's a little more

829
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:06,159
chill in Oakland yeah yeah I think they

830
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,720
smoke more weed in Oakland honestly D so

831
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,320
yeah let's let's dive into talking about

832
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,278
cannabis because this is mostly a

833
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,678
cannabis show you know you guys work and

834
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:18,038
I feel like there's so many parallels to

835
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,759
uh cannabis and art yeah and street art

836
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:22,798
and the people I think a lot of guys

837
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:26,398
smoke you used to smoke and I used to

838
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:29,599
smoke like heavy every day just few

839
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:33,599
blunts you know and just hot boxing and

840
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:37,158
I probably smoked for about like

841
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:39,278
15 years like straight yeah so I don't

842
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,919
know but it got to the like we were just

843
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:45,759
always hitting bongs whatever gravity

844
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,720
bongs joints and then just five people

845
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,879
rotations hot boxing but it got to a

846
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,319
point

847
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,600
where it was just you know

848
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,278
like it wasn't fun anymore and it

849
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:59,079
started making me paranoid oh no

850
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:59,759
paranoia you're a burnout that's what

851
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,638
they

852
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,798
call there's a name for you you're a

853
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:06,879
burnout yeah it happens to the best of

854
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,038
them I have a couple not even a couple I

855
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,360
have lots of friends that have become

856
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:13,359
burnouts yeah they were heavy smokers

857
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,759
and that they got the paranoia yeah just

858
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,359
I didn't I like that so I don't know and

859
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,798
then plus just smoking anything now like

860
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,599
um I'm a little bit shook just because

861
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,879
my my mom passed away from lung cancer

862
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:26,199
so I'm like all right I don't want any

863
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,919
[ __ ] to [ __ ] with my lungs even though I

864
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,319
spray paint you know what I'm saying but

865
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,480
I try to wear the respirator but a

866
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:34,000
little counterintuitive yeah but I'll

867
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,159
mess with like you know some CBD and and

868
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,759
little gummies here and there yeah you

869
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,240
know but I I wish though man like

870
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,599
there's so much stuff available right

871
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,880
now I want to dud the gummies and

872
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,359
Edibles now are on a whole different

873
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:51,039
level too as as wild as it is on the

874
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:53,319
graffiti scene and the street art scene

875
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,759
cannabis and Edibles have evolved just

876
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:58,240
as much if not more I imag Rice Krispy

877

bong or something yeah yeah so I mean we

892
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,278
yeah for a while yeah I you know it was

893
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,798
fun to like have the creative side of uh

894
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:42,000
you know of of just just getting lost in

895
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,480
my drawings and um and one thing about

896
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,440
smoking and painting um you know we got

897
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,278
a another buddy rali shout out romali

898
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,639
he's in illuminaries but he kind of like

899
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,519
you know when you when you're smoking

900
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:54,199
you know there's a there's a Zone where

901
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,079
like where there's like a visual thing

902
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,278
where like things like I don't know what

903
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,879
it is but your distance Chang

904
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,079
like things pop out and whatnot yeah and

905
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,080
so like there there's it does help the

906
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:07,599
painting there was a point in time where

907
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,119
like I felt a little bit reliant on it

908
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,679
for painting and that kind of scared me

909
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,879
a little bit I was like why you know it

910
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,039
did help me it helped me like visualize

911
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:19,358
things and like how about Jiu-Jitsu have

912
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:21,079
you rolled High the best I I have not uh

913
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,199
oh see you're messing up right there

914
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,519
well you know well you know get better I

915
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:29,239
have is the the you know the the micro

916
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:31,119
mushrooms on rolling um cuz well for the

917
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,398
competitions my my cousin's been

918
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,240
recommending me that like he's like to

919
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:37,358
calm the nerves and all that so yeah no

920
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,918
wonder you went first place last

921
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,719
tournament that's

922
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:45,158
great it's the mushrooms and then the

923
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,638
yeah I mean I think Israel ad aagna was

924
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,000
talking about how he does the mushroom

925
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,519
micro does training and yeah I mean I

926
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,358
think there's a lot of benefits to micro

927
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,838
doing even weed though like micro doing

928
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,838
weed like I think it's a great way when

929
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:59,559
you're training to

930
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,320
uh whe whether it's like lifting weights

931
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,279
training Jiu-Jitsu boxing whatever

932
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,838
you're doing I feel like even if you

933
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,560
don't go the full Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz

934
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,920
style but even taking one hit it kind of

935
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,480
like for for me I don't have to think

936
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,200
about what I'm doing I just flow more it

937
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,519
makes me flow more because I'm one of

938
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,039
those people that really wants to think

939
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,519
about what I'm doing when I'm right

940
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,880
training and I feel like it just makes

941
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,519
me flow more H interesting yeah I

942
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,400
haven't honestly experimented with that

943
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,759
too much but I know that the Jiu-Jitsu

944
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,079
community and weed community or the VIN

945
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,040
diagram is very close oh yeah um but

946
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,599
yeah that definitely you know the other

947
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,039
thing about like the weed the technology

948
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,000
there like which I think is awes like

949
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,599
the whole micro do idea you know

950
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,119
everyone has that experience of like

951
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,359
taking too many brownies or whatever and

952
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,480
you're just like never again you know

953
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,039
type of thing totally and so like having

954
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,880
having it now with the gummies where

955
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,719
it's like it's very you can just just a

956
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,079
really light dose and you know exactly

957
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:57,199
it's a consistent experience versus like

958
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,318
not knowing if you're going to be on

959
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,000
Mars

960
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:01,440
a couple hours you don't have to like

961
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
slice the smallest little bit of the

962
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,318
gummy off to see so like that's that's

963
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,480
definitely been a huge innovation in the

964
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:11,279
industry yeah control dosing it's

965
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,800
fantastic and then also specific

966
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,359
cannaboids now we've got CBD CBG

967
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,480
CBN

968
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:22,440
THC there's the Delta 8 the Delta you

969
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,119
know there's Delta 8 Delta 9 Delta 10

970
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,838
and we have all these cannabinoids and

971
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,599
blending all of them and finding out

972
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:31,279
what works well for what individual you

973
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,599
know because we all have different body

974
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,960
chemistry so it's really amazing that

975
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,760
there's all these things that you can

976
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,039
take and potentially improve whatever

977
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,240
you're doing right right you know

978
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,559
whether it's sleep or you know sleep and

979
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,078
Recovery I think that's a good one for

980
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,358
Canabis too I think it's a great way to

981
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,880
you know it's not for everybody yeah so

982
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,000
you know I think that's the beauty of it

983
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,400
we we're also individual with our body

984
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,159
chemistries yeah that uh what works for

985
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
one person might not work for the next

986
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,318
but

987
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,880
sleep especially sleep recovery I use a

988
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:07,279
CBN this um CBN and like melatonin drop

989
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,760
sometimes you know for sleeping that

990
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,040
[ __ ] works wonders little tinctures yeah

991
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,560
little tinctures is there something

992
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,358
better than that like for sleeping like

993
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,719
CBN is good I think CBN is great and

994
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:21,880
then just mild doses of THC too much

995
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,039
makes me not want to sleep right but if

996
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,318
I take the right amount that's what I

997
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,759
like about Delta eights is where I could

998
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:28,199
pop Delta eights if I'm TI if if I want

999
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,119
to be tired

1000
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:34,838
uh delta8 are they're it's from hemp

1001
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,200
it's dried from CBD and they convert it

1002
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,358
into Delta a and I think there's

1003
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,318
companies that are doing it right and

1004
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:40,519
there's companies that are doing it

1005
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:43,279
wrong but I feel like that's a great one

1006
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:46,079
for sleep for me is that with CBN knocks

1007
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,640
me out I wake up and if I take the right

1008
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,800
dose I wake up super refreshed if I take

1009
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,639
too much I wake up groggy so it's all

1010
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
about like learning learning what dose

1011
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,000
is right for you yeah I think like 50

1012
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,079
milligrams of Delta 8 is really good for

1013
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,639
me and it's like 20% the strength of

1014
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,760
Delta 9 THC so it's really mild in in

1015
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,480
comparison but uh and then same thing if

1016
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,400
you want inflammation CBG is amazing CBD

1017
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,519
with CBG is amazing also with thca which

1018
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,960
by itself thca you can eat a ton of

1019
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:21,039
thca and it doesn't get you high it has

1020
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,760
anti-inflammatory properties that with

1021
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,838
the with the CBG is amazing uh the

1022
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,480
second you heat it up it'll get you

1023
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,358
higher than [ __ ] but it turns into a

1024
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,280
Delta 9 THC but damn just by itself it's

1025
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,000
pretty amazing yeah no I'd love to tap

1026
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,000

1079
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,599
[ __ ] amazing when I smoke it I love

1080

that I love that oh yeah now that's what

1081
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,240
I always wonder is like like Whiz

1082
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,759
Khalifa burner

1083
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:58,199
currency how do they smoke all day and

1084
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,480
then not be tired and and still perform

1085
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,399
you know what I'm say like and function

1086
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,719
at a high level or are people taking

1087
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,160
naps dab naps or like Snoop too like he

1088
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,480
I think I think taking naps but also

1089
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:11,039
drinking coffee in is part of a

1090
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,199
lifestyle too so like you get you adapt

1091
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,599
to whatever you do right so like

1092
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,399
smoking uh I have days where I smoke all

1093
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,119
day and I have days where I dab and I

1094
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,599
don't do that every day and I love doing

1095

it on the show and not every guest like

1096
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,800
smoking you know it's like it's so

1097
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,280
individual to your body chemistry and

1098
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,400
some people man they could just hang

1099
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,440

1357
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,440
I wonder if we ever ran into

1358
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:27,199
probably home I'll have to bring my

1359
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,798
flyers and you can go through

1360
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,960
like oh [ __ ] I completely forgot about

1361
00:51:28,798 --> 00:51:33,440
that I love digging through that drawer

1362
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,318
flyers every once in a while you know so

1363
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,280
many part bro your your stack yeah my

1364
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,599
stack is probably like this this thick

1365
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,079
that's just like the flyers I saved yeah

1366
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,079
you know what I'm saying I mean I think

1367
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,480
someone made a book of flyers I didn't

1368
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,920
contribute any mind of the book or

1369
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,599
anything like that but like I feel like

1370
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,519
I could make my own book you should that

1371
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,559
would be cool publish that dude some of

1372
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:54,039
the art was just incredible Owen I don't

1373
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,079
know if you remember Owen who did the

1374
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:58,798
art back in the day it was a very

1375
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,480
specific style it was like almost

1376
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:03,239
abstract characters that were all

1377
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,159
stretched out and really really basic

1378
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,199
that's dope but yeah there was some good

1379
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:08,879
stuff back in the day like yeah I was

1380
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:12,159
like Tim what were they using back then

1381
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,160
like 3D programs they were oh no was the

1382
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,358
Photoshop filters

1383
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:19,759
oh filter the [ __ ] out of it h filter it

1384
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:23,159
just like mad fractals and [ __ ] layers

1385
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,000
and all that that's crazy yeah it's

1386
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:27,318
funny how we've evolved from the 90s if

1387
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,119
you really kind of dive into

1388
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:30,599
where we were then and how we are now

1389
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,519
and yeah we don't have Raves because

1390
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:34,119
it's like just like disco once it's gone

1391
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:36,119
it'll never be the same like we can

1392
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:37,640
always try to redo it Drumm and bass is

1393
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,838
another one I actually like drum like

1394
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:43,078
drum B I didn't like it back then I

1395
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:45,558
didn't like those rooms where it was

1396
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,400
like like it was just too aggressive for

1397
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:48,760
me I was like into more the the Mellow

1398
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,480
Vibe and I feel like some of those drum

1399
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,040
and bass where it was like but now like

1400
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,639
they they [ __ ] they'll build it up

1401
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,480
and they'll drop it [ __ ] it's got

1402
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:59,879
It's got a lot of and like Good Vibes I

1403
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,079
like good energy and some of the stuff

1404
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,079
was kind of dark back in the

1405
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,559
day it was cool when they had live

1406

before it was commercialized I mean

1414

maybe it's commercialized now and stuff

1415

1460
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:19,798
Area is just filled with places to go

and things to do you know as far as like

1462
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:23,239
if you're into culture and you're into

1463
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,039
the scene it's like the Bay Area has so

1464
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:26,919
much to offer doesn't matter what it is

best I mean y y that's the beauty of big

1470
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,039
cities too I feel like they they have

1471
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,279
this culture there's like this magnetism

1472
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,480
that draws people together from

1473
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,760
different places exactly exactly cuz

1474
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,798

you know for the hell of it you know

1478

the moment where where you're like damn

1556
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:52,759
this is badass yeah I mean I so I

1557
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,720
trained it the the I mean a different it

1558
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,799
so before when I was wrestling I

1559
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,118
wrestled in high school a little bit

1560
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,639
and then over at Dragon House in San

1561
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,680
Francisco before it was Dragon House it

1562
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,279
was white dragon and we did grappling

1563
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:06,838
and we did some you know some Mongolian

1564
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,599
wrestling and some grappling and

1565
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:11,599
takedowns and stuff like that and there

1566
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,599
was a lot of fun but it was also a kung

1567
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,200
fu school at the time and then I always

1568
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,838
wanted to get into it but I didn't

1569
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,318
really want to go to another school

1570
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:20,679
because I felt like it was abandoning my

1571
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:23,079
original school so I didn't I held out

1572
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:24,558
on training Jiu-Jitsu like with another

1573
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:26,798
Jiu-Jitsu school because I felt

1574
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,559
obligated to this Kung school that I was

1575
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:29,960
at like if I went to train somewhere

1576
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,880
else it would be bad like that's just

1577
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,960
not what you did back in the day or what

1578
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,880
I thought was necessarily right and then

1579
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,079
still a thing now I mean it is it is

1580
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,680
weird sometimes but but I think it's a

1581
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,720
little bit a little bit different but

1582
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:43,000
then uh Briant when the first day I

1583
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:46,239
chained there like I thought I was tough

1584
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,400
and it was so humbling the first

1585
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:53,078
day and it was a small group of guys and

1586
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,838
you know I think uh pretty pretty

1587
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:57,880
skilled guys and PE I mean I think I was

1588
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:59,440
so so unskilled they were just you been

1589
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:03,400
grappling but you hadn't been doing

1590
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,280
Jiu-Jitsu okay so you came in you came I

1591
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,519
can handle myself I you know it's like I

1592
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,480
could fight yeah I can fight you realize

1593
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:12,000
how ineffective everything you thought

1594
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,119
was effective or thought would be

1595
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,599
effective is unless you're some badass

1596
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:18,079
you're GNA your your ego is going to get

1597
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,480
broken real quick and jiujitsu is so

1598
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:23,240
beautiful because you really learn who

1599
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:26,679
you are right so like a lot of times we

1600
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:27,959
have these false senses of who we are we

1601
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:30,279
think we're this person because we have

1602
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,440
this ego right and so unless you do

1603
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,640
psychedelics or jiujitsu you you know

1604
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,720
you you build these

1605
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:40,078
these seriously though you want to get

1606
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:42,038
humbled psch I'm telling you but that's

1607
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,920
that's like breaking those barriers you

1608
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:45,440
really learn who you are right and

1609
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,920
that's the beauty of Jiu-Jitsu for me

1610
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,599
and it's also the beauty of psychedelics

1611
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,039
it's like you you realize how the world

1612
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,760
really is because a lot of times people

1613
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,920
don't see the world as it really is they

1614
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,400
have this imagination if you've never

1615
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,798
been in a fight but you're like you're

1616
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,760
tough you're probably going to get your

1617
01:00:57,798 --> 01:01:02,000
ass kicked right there's not a lot of

1618
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,200
guys that have never been in a fight

1619
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,760
especially bigger guys just cuz you're

1620
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:07,798
big it's like you fight against a chain

1621
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,160
guy and it's over like it's just it's

1622
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,920
over that quick and there's a lot of

1623
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:13,000
guys that I'm big I'm strong I'm six

1624
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,358
foot three or six foot four and I smash

1625
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,119
on fools well uh there's a big wakeup

1626
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:19,759
call if you ever get in a real fight and

1627
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:21,039
you know what you might get lucky

1628
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,280
sometimes people get lucky but not

1629
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,839
against a pro fighter no not against the

1630
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,519
MMA fighter or guy who's trained

1631
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:28,480
Jiu-Jitsu if you're on the ground

1632
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:30,559
with somebody who has trained jiujitsu

1633
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,639
for a couple years or even a year and

1634
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,519
you've never done it you're in big

1635
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,558
trouble for the most part unless you

1636
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:36,798
know you have maybe some wrestling

1637
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:38,640
background you might be able to get away

1638
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:40,318
but wrestling you know we weren't doing

1639
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,358

1640
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,440
