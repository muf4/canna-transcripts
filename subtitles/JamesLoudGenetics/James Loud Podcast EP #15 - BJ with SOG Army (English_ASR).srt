fasting really good weather's been nice

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,660
it hasn't been too crazy of a summer so

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,179
far we'll see what happens right so

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,859
you're here local in California yes so

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,439
yeah and you have a cultivation facility

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,880
in Santa Rosa and you're also at MSO

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,099
you're working in other states as well

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,260
correct yes so tell us a little bit

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,179
about it so

17
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,539
we started out well I started out on the

18
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,058
East Coast came here in 2007 already

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,399
cultivating for 10 or 15 years

20
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,039
wow got into Medical

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,439
so like a second gen farmer right

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,100
um I was medical came here started doing

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:02,218
uh things with my internet friends and

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,799
selling the shops getting into licensing

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,599
so I got licensed and did that whole

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,880
thing here and then

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,158
how were those struggles going from

28
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,140
medical and direct I think everyone has

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,260
their stories

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,760
it was hard I mean but uh I don't know

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,040
if I would have it any other way it's

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,640
the only way I think to continue forward

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,340
in this industry totally I agree 100 you

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,859
know the trials and tribulations in the

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,780
the guys that did it first out of the

36
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,180
toughest because it was totally like

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,219
what do we do and then oh then there

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,780
sometimes there was no answers for Stuff

39
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,298
there's a lot of waiting going on

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,579
between for licensing you know getting

41
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,360
your license and doing it properly uh

42
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:48,000
laws and rules changing right so yeah

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,560
and then it was kind of free-for-all in

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,420
the back in the day and then you know

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,299
once they started tightening the reins

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,099
on it it got a little crazy totally I

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,079
mean it was loose at first though I mean

48
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,359
like even going into the transition for

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,339
medical and to rec when you were in

50
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,259
Sonoma County so yeah they're pretty

51
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,640
chill there I mean I wouldn't say it's

52
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,680
the easiest counting but it's definitely

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,318
not the worst they offered us a great

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,719
thing it was called penalty relief yeah

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,119
so if you're a medical grower

56
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,159
that was in a zoning that they approved

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,580
and you wanted to go legal if you got

58
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,340
architect drawn plans they would let you

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,700
transition and with temporary occupancy

60
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,860
so we are able to save our asses by that

61
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,500
as Farmers because at that point I had

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,180
two licensed things going

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,580
um one zoning didn't work that one

64
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,099
worked and yeah well you're up in

65
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,660
reading too right how's that plan going

66
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,238
dude

67
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,098
it's a it's a great area for doing

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
business if you want to pay to do it

69
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,598
yeah it's always hot and right it's hot

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,239
as hell yeah not always it's cold during

71
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,280
the winter yeah but you're right

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,159
bro we got a lot of snow this year more

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,539
than I had in years crazy rain we had we

74
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,180
had the most rain I've ever experienced

75
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,159
in my life in the bay here uh and you

76
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,200
guys also you had a lot of rain and snow

77
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,939
and all kinds of crazy weather up there

78
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,219
it looks like yeah definitely we got

79
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,199
feet this year yeah how'd that affect

80
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,878
your cultivation facility I'm not up and

81
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,738
going yet well I wasn't at that point

82
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,299
right I am now it didn't affect us at

83
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,920
all we were doing construction we could

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,080
still make it there to the warehouse so

85
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,119
nice I was shocked that the locals were

86
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,280
you know still working with snow you

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,099
know but yeah people want to make money

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,739
people people work yeah so it was more

89
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:30,000
like electricians yeah yeah yeah

90
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,920
nice

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,479
so uh what kind of genetics are you into

92
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,059
these days

93
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:39,179
man I'm really trying

94
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,299
to just going more towards gas these

95
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,099
days or old school ogs yeah um I feel

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,379
like that's what I personally like I've

97
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,818
been kind of boring myself with Skittles

98
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:49,500
lately a little bit for the past six

99
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,878
months or year like just seeing how much

100
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,419
I could smoke because it wasn't

101
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,399
previously available but right you know

102
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,958
uh I'm really kind of just looking for

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,379
crazy stuff I've been working with a guy

104
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,819
named crane City and working with mosca

105
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:05,158
Negra a lot

106
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,780
trying to hunt through their gear kind

107
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,459
of collaboratively

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,979
yeah Rick's a great guy he was on our

109
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,598
previous show oh cool yeah awesome yeah

110
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,818
Rick's the best yeah dude Rick is the

111
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,259
best but yeah working with him so you're

112
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,819
doing Fino hunting you're doing

113
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,039
selections helping with selections you

114
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:23,399
like popping seeds you like trying to

115
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,319
find Winners right Keepers and winners

116
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,418
and yeah so in all the legal girls we

117
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,040
have final hunt areas that's awesome so

118
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:33,418
how big

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,900
let's see it would be 164 square feet or

120
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:39,180
64 feet long by two so 128 square feet

121
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:41,579
that we hunt and we do one plant per

122
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,620
square foot cool so that currently

123
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,418
that's the deal and reading and we do

124
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,100
that every round every 30 days which

125
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,099
turns into

126
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,660
hunting 80 to 100 seed yeah at a time so

127
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,939
we're gonna find some cool stuff but in

128
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,820
production in Reading we set it up

129
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,379
around Fino hunting yeah so or the

130
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,779
ability to final hunt bring it to Market

131
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,519
under a nursery license with uh

132
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,299
distribution cultivation all under one

133
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,219
house

134
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,079
yeah people don't understand typically

135
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,720
how long it takes to get stuff to Market

136
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,478
from seed like from one seed doing the

137
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,620
process of the selection and then

138
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,359
actually growing that out and

139
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,879
replicating it big enough to where you

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,800
can produce flour of it it takes a while

141
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,860
right so you want to walk us through

142
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,300
your process our process is uh I don't

143
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,060
know if it's different but I feel like

144
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,280
it's the old school way so we grow seed

145
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,579
we pop seed we usually try to go 50 to

146
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,198
100 seed whatever comes up comes up at

147
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,839
that point the strong plants any even

148
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,340
the weak plants will let them go we'll

149
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,779
grow those plants for three to four

150
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,299
months

151
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:44,399
which is dedicating a pretty good bit of

152
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,620
area for a small retro you know because

153
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,060
we're only 100 lights right yeah well

154
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,220
and it's a loss leader for the most part

155
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,160
it's not like people want to buy a mixed

156
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,979
bag of stuff no and so you're giving up

157
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,840
a a large area of your growth that could

158
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:00,659
be used for flower production for other

159
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,478
things right so we're gonna run all

160
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,320
those seed the first time keeping all

161
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:09,538
the Clones or the seed plant in veg so I

162
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,159
will take a top off the Clone or top off

163
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,620
the seed

164
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,220
have a clone labeled to the plant that's

165
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,230
in veg right take that clone flower it

166
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,380
in our test area

167
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,080
[Music]

168
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,120
one time right it's kind of like a rough

169
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,139
sort at that point and you're just like

170
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,740
okay

171
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,500
whatever 10 that you guys we all agree

172
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,960
is a group is good we'll keep those down

173
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,519
Nice kill all the other plants

174
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,978
kill the males or give them out if

175
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,359
people want them right move on to the

176
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,879
next step okay now you have those two

177
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,180
all right that's six months at that

178
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,620
point probably so grow it again so see

179
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,780
what happens yeah yeah and in that

180
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,000
period you're seeing significant change

181
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,638
from the seed run to the second

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,139
generation of Clone maybe even the third

183
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,199
generation of Clone there's changes that

184
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,360
go on with sexual maturity in the plant

185
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,819
um yeah and really that second or third

186
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,919
time is special right on the third run

187
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,199
we a lot of the stuff that I showed you

188
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,939
earlier before we came on live was third

189
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,740
run yeah

190
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,538
and it's weird because a lot of the

191
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,699
things I'll say on the first run

192
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:16,439
definitely don't strike my interest at

193
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,120
all that over time you know on the

194
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,579
second or third run

195
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,199
change yeah so some of the ones that are

196
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,899
really hot in the beginning might not be

197
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,639
as great as some of the ones that just

198
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,859
didn't catch up quite as fast and then

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,300
all of a sudden wow you look at this a

200
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,580
different genetic than you saw the first

201
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,460
time and that's where you find the

202
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:38,098
special stuff I agree so well yeah and

203
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,779
if you skip that step you you have the

204
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:42,240
possibility of losing a lot of good

205
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,059
stuff I've lost so many things that way

206
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,978
yep I'll just do in a rough sort

207
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,098
killing and then being like Oh my God

208
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,839
but number whatever yeah you smoke it

209
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:55,139
later like it's been curing or it's been

210
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,519
like and you forgot about it yeah go

211
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,180
back to smoking you're like oh my God

212
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:02,219
what is that right it's lost yeah yeah

213
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,780
so that that's kind of our method and

214
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,300
now we keep everything for quite a while

215
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,500
and so and you're working in what other

216
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,199
states are you in your mission

217
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,660
Mississippi now Mississippi wow Mrs how

218
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,520
is Mississippi it's exactly like you'd

219
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,380
imagine but it's pretty Progressive when

220
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,019
it comes to weed believe it like the

221
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,819
locals as a whole the state yeah as a

222
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,339
whole is more accepting cannabis than

223
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,160
what I've seen in California really wow

224
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,959
in some like the rural areas yeah that

225
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,319
are super conservative have been

226
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,639
pro-weed huh so that's cool yeah that's

227
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,800
really cool and you guys are doing

228
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,658
cultivation you have multiple licenses

229
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,458

230
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:40,979
transporter which is the same as

231
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,199
distribution in Cali yeah cultivation

232
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,839
and Manufacturing nice you can do

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,259

no just Mark Brazen oh nice yeah cool or

235
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,338

236
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,379
some cards but no nothing like with

237
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,300

248
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,000
just don't like doing dabs on the show

249
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,799
so there's there's like a couple no-nos

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,139
that we've gone through like my previous

251
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,699
show that I did before the podcast I

252
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,399
smoked some Durban Poison with Marlin

253
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,420
that's a big No-No definitely him and I

254
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,220
we

255
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,679
couldn't remember what we wanted to talk

256
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,959
about half the time and you know so I

257
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,079
try to keep it Chill on the shows

258
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:47,179
so yeah uh you have any flower to show

259
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,180
today I definitely do let me grab them

260
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:58,500
so what we got here is basically

261
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,799
um a lot of sisters to our strain pink

262
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,720
Zaza that is uh we Fino hunted two or

263
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,259
three years ago now yeah from exotic Gen

264
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,879
X crane City oh yeah okay cool crane

265
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,819
City yeah so

266
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,860
um it was pink Zaza e actually oh yeah

267
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,480
and it was never released because he

268
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,360
disappeared for some reason but I was

269
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,180
testing nice so he sends them to me in a

270
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,680
vial with like blue tape over them right

271
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:24,359
never met the guy in person so when I

272
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,859
get the seeds

273
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,278
it's just a piece of blue tape like

274
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,139
written and I didn't see the eye so he

275
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,519
disappeared for two years we found a

276
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,019
keeper

277
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,039
I thought it was Zaza it was already

278
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:40,679
sold as Zaza but it's actually pink

279
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:43,620
which is supposedly his take on acai

280
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,078
interesting yeah so a little backstory

281
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,720
so that's was our Keeper at that point

282
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,899
so then he sent me more from the pink

283
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,540
line yeah and so this is pink Duos and

284
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,879
pink Godzilla nice which are the same

285
00:10:54,539 --> 00:11:00,179
father different mother

286
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,820
interesting yeah so yeah so what kind of

287
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:06,299
so this one right here is the the pink

288
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,579
Duos number two which is not the one

289
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,859
that we're dropping yet this was the one

290
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,739
that needed three rounds but I almost

291
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,320
killed nice color good structure

292
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,419
interesting nose yeah almost a little

293
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,640
cotton candy-ish

294
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:22,620
a little gas to back I like that we're

295
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,360
gonna let it go yeah literally this was

296
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,440
around three or four they were like

297
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,000
we're gonna you know and then you're

298
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,860
like no no this might be the one right

299
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,059
so this was our keeper before this is

300
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,060
pink Duo's number four

301
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,320
foreign

302
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,199
this has a little bit of orange rind in

303
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,019
it it's more like the Zaza there's zazai

304
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,519
I feel this is more like candy gas or

305
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,820
something yeah that's more like candy

306
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,039
gas this is definitely more it's not

307
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,860
Tangy at all or like Tropicana even it's

308
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:55,379
like right but it isn't everyone it does

309
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,300
have a little bit of that Citrus rind in

310
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:00,600
it for sure my partner initially was

311
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:02,879
like it's Tangy we cannot sell it on all

312
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,339
that whole line because he is so like I

313
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,019
hate Tangy I hate Jack totally you know

314
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,940
that's it doesn't even matter like if

315
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,278
it's a hint of that so but this has

316
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,140
really nice structure yeah it looks like

317
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,379
it yields really well too I like the way

318
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,019
the calyx stack it is that's like 52

319
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,659
days and you finish in 52 days that's

320
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,700
like maybe 55 yeah but somewhere between

321
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,740
52 and 55 anything like that that's

322
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,379
great it was shockingly early yeah

323
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,980
compared to the Zaza which was like 70

324
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:34,078
65 70 to really like it doesn't even the

325
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,879
nose the look of the flower nothing it

326
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,399
doesn't come out and all the last 10

327
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,019
days for sure yeah a lot of stuff same

328
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,639
thing color a lot of times color doesn't

329
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,959
come out until the end I mean sometimes

330
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,819
some stuff is color all the way through

331
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,500
but a lot of the good stuff where it's

332
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,600
color it comes out at the end

333
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,259
definitely color is so subjective people

334
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,659
love it hate it I think

335
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,278
uh taste is more important taste is

336
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,899
definitely more important but it I feel

337
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,539
like the market is just like the market

338
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,159
demands purple it's got to have so now

339
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,379
it's not fully purple we just want a

340
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,539
little purple I don't know I guess I'm

341
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,059
learning I I'm behind I was looking for

342
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,399
all purple so that's pink Godzilla which

343
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,439
is a sister and it's so funny because

344
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,240
this nose is almost in the middle of

345
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,980
these two it has the candy gas but it

346
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,379
also and they're also like a little hint

347
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,519
of the Rind too right it's super small

348
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,379
hint of it

349
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,419
but this checks all the boxes this is

350
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:25,919
like marketweed this is the stuff that

351
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,379
the hype weed that everybody wants

352
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,139
purple candy gas it's got the look

353
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,458
it definitely has the Optics and you

354
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,740
know that the bag appeal of this stuff

355
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,259
is great and so as far as nutrients what

356
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,720
nutrients do you run man we're on Athena

357
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,659
right now yeah we use compost teas and

358
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,019
like humic fulvic Bud swells uh probably

359
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,759
30 of the time cool in cocoa cocoa is

360
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,679
good what what cocoa brand is your

361
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,740
favorite we're using floor Flex or uh

362
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,439
Cloud Core yeah right now yeah I like

363
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,180
those guys cool but um I've been looking

364
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,680
for different fertilizer companies we've

365
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,479
we're trialing cutting edge ladder

366
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,838
powder I'm a huge fan louder powder

367
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,519
shout out to Uncle John and Sean cutting

368
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,860
edges the [ __ ] definitely those guys

369
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,778
hooked me up and um we're giving it a

370
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,759
shot right now actually yeah if you have

371
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:13,559
any tips I'm down you know off camera or

372
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,240
whatever yeah yeah absolutely it's good

373
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,879
stuff I think it's it's simple and easy

374
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,560
to use if that I feel like

375
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,000
it's a it's a good all-around product

376
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,518
and you know and

377
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm not stuck on just one nutrient line

378
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,759
out there saying one that's better than

379
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
the other but there are a few good ones

380
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,000
and Cutting Edge is definitely one of

381
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,680
the few good ones you know I like front

382
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,659
row as well I think front row they do a

383
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,479
good job and gotcha a front row is

384
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,338
always good for for me United nobody

385
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,860
even really knows about United United is

386
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:44,459
amazing and that's made by the owners of

387
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,039
Athena uh really good stuff good to know

388
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:49,500
yeah that's a fun one so if you yeah if

389
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,120
you're used to running uh Athena

390
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,980
transitioning United is not very

391
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,959
difficult interesting so I prepared for

392
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,639
like Jr crop Tech or anything at our new

393
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,778
spot where we had like I haven't ran it

394
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,459
but I heard that's good I'm sure it's

395
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,439
good Josh and Ramsey you can't go wrong

396
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,338
right they seem really awesome and you

397
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,139
know we're really knowledgeable about

398
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,000
the product and it made sense to me for

399
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,159
how they're trying to apply it yeah but

400
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,958
at the new place we have 16 heads on our

401
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,719
he Anderson so the thought was that

402
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,518
we'll always be trialing a new nutrient

403
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,079
line and kind of trying to get a hold on

404
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,759
the science of it of like what we're

405
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,198
seeing versus what we're putting for

406
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
inputs and you know and also

407
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,859
manufacturing the products right so yeah

408
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,800
they help put this facility together at

409
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,180
one point oh awesome of course yeah so

410
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,519
let's dive into your history a little

411
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,559
bit you know uh when did you start

412
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,980
smoking you're about my age we're about

413
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,958
this 1994. 94 94 I was 91 94 yeah it's

414
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,579
all about the same time it was when you

415
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,278
know it was the Wild Wild West you know

416
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:43,439
different times yeah so you know there

417
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,820
was some purple weed but like it was

418
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,800
green weed and brown weed yeah

419
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,480
definitely so yeah and then there was

420
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,838
there was some Exotics too you know we

421
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,060
got some stuff and like uh Maui Wowie

422
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,800
what about you guys so my dad Greer I

423
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:59,399
was in like a weed desert I was in

424
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:01,679
Georgia oh wow in Alabama when I was

425
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,919
growing up so there was no weed but my

426
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:08,278
dad luckily gerd so he grew like big bud

427
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,139
Friesland Indica he had like uh really

428
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,360
cool so he grew from seed started from

429
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,480
seed from Dutch seed mostly yeah yeah

430
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,100
from Dutch seed nice yeah so that's I

431
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,320
stole his weed you know growing up

432
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,659
totally legitimately stole his plants

433
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,399
you know his plants yeah actual plants

434
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:25,679
yeah I stole plant like the first time I

435
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,539
smoked I stole a plant like so how many

436
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,519
plants did he grow a lot like probably

437
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:31,379
40 or 50 in the backyard but he had an

438
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,899
indoor garden and we have property in

439
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:35,458
the country so uh assuming now he was

440
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,139
just flipping clones at the end of the

441
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,698
season because it was like late October

442
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,440
and I'm cutting through the backyard to

443
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:44,399
go to my friend's house and just right

444
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,259
there's like 45 six gallon pots like

445
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,419
spread out through the backyard with

446
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,459
plants like three feet tall flowered out

447
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,500

00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:13,319
getting sick though the three days in

559
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,779
San Francisco I got the worst flu I've

560
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,399
ever had in my life I just didn't do it

561
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,779
this time I was too busy building the

562
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,000
new thing yeah

563
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,798
great shows I heard I wanted to see the

564
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,220
Drone show really bad the Drone show was

565
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,139
nuts the whole thing was nuts and I am

566
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,380
used to getting seats usually you know

567
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,538
for shows concerts for the most part but

568
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,520
uh standing with my buddy Ben we were

569
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:38,220
like 20 feet from the stage all three

570
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,079
nights didn't miss a single song it was

571
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,579
it was nuts it was amazing it was like

572
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,019
one of the better performances for dead

573
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,918
and Company they finally got their [ __ ]

574
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,298
together

575
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,340
which

576
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:48,720
to be 100 honest I was against dead and

577
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,339
Company when it first started and I was

578
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,220
like John Mayer this there's you've got

579
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,720
to be kidding me you know and I couldn't

580
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,519
believe that John Mayer was going to be

581
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,500
stepping in for Jerry and I think a

582
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,000
little hurt over the whole Jerry thing

583
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,819
and them trying to revise it or whatever

584
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,619
but like he really grows on you his

585
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,240
guitar playing has gotten better I feel

586
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,099
like when he first came out he had this

587
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,200
commercial sound to his voice which

588
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,639
didn't really fit into the band and now

589
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,960
you listen to his voice and they've

590
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,759
they've filtered it differently and

591
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,919
they've changed it a little bit to where

592
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,960
I feel like it just really kind of

593
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,700
integrates well with the band where he's

594
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,220
it's part of the band and his solos he

595
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,360
just rips on guitar the guy is just he's

596
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,819
a killer

597
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,500
so yeah a lot of fun you know it's not

598
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:30,240
Jerry it's not supposed to be Jerry but

599
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,700
it was definitely an amazing experience

600
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,919
that's awesome I heard they're on Tempo

601
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,100
a lot more than they had in a long time

602
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:40,200
yeah yeah I know teal singing I mean no

603
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,158
teal singing is great I'm a big teal fan

604
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,259
too

605
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,179
so I'm here at Jerry's hand painted on

606
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,759
his face with the missing finger that's

607
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,860
dope yeah it was really it was cool a

608
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,779
lot of fun and a lot of good people that

609
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,759
I see it's just like I got a span abyss

610
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,440
and I see a certain group of people I go

611
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,779
to dead and Company parking lots and I

612
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,519
see the same friends that I see at those

613
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,619
shows you know that

614
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,418
that sometimes it's the only time I get

615
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:06,239
to see those guys right

616
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,759
so yeah so do you do events as well yes

617
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,740
I do nice yeah definitely seshes and

618
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,000
other stuff like that yeah definitely up

619
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,099
and down the state pretty much anything

620
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,659
legally we can and you know push the

621
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,339
boundaries where we can if we can work

622
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,900
something out like now that everyone's

623
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,599
kind of figured out

624
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,600
like a delivery service to help fulfill

625
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,599
to a patient yeah or whatever

626
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,339
so if you were to go back and talk to

627
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,379
your younger self

628
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:33,720
uh you know in the first couple years of

629
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,460
getting involved with all the knowledge

630
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,798
you have now from the stuff you've done

631
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,798
what advice would you give yourself

632
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:43,259
go harder than you want to yeah don't

633
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,599
stop grind like grind hard as [ __ ] like

634
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,980
if you think you want to do the show but

635
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,619
you don't know if you have like 10 grand

636
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,819
yeah do the show Even if you know you're

637
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:52,739
going to spend the 10 grand to do the

638
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,538
show yeah you know if you break even

639
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,159
even if you break even do it every time

640
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:58,259
because eventually you'll quit breaking

641
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,840
even that's my goal too it shows is to

642
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,019
break even yeah and I still sometimes

643
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,279
don't break even doing shows and it just

644
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,619
is what it is it's part of the business

645
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,500
and it's about grinding I agree

646
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:12,418
so keep grinding yeah and push harder

647
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,740
than you ever pushed before and you know

648
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,580
I think

649
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,500
mentally were were uh not as tough as we

650
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,658
most people aren't as mentally tough as

651
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,880
they actually are yeah like we think we

652
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,580
can only go here but we can go here oh

653
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,200
definitely so sometimes you want to give

654
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:29,579
up but sometimes it's just perseverance

655
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,620
and the ones that are left are the ones

656
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,538
that didn't give up oh definitely indeed

657
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,339
100 that's the biggest fear or the

658
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,740
biggest thing I regret was

659
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,939
I I was a brand and just didn't do

660
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,519
shares and we were concerned with

661
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,038
building our infrastructure and I think

662
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,740
on looking back at it I should have been

663
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:49,079
going to shows like crazy hard like we

664
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,819
are now but you know yeah I'm in one of

665
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,038
those giving modes too so if you see are

666
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,599
you giving moods at the shows I've been

667
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,599
going to we give out a lot of products

668
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,699
for people to try we do too seeds I like

669
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,678
giving out seeds yeah I think that's

670
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,960
important getting your name out you know

696
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,600
I got a question for you SOG Army is

697
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:08,579
this SM for sea of green yeah okay good

698
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,480
that's cool yeah I think it's that's a

699
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:12,000
great name

700
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,038
so and was that just an epiphany that

701
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,798
came on or how did how did the name come

702
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,079
about it was my Forum name that was your

703
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,298
Forum name really you see that's pretty

704
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,519
cool that it never was supposed to be a

705
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:25,798
business it was my Forum name yes sir

706
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,720
but when I came and I started meeting

707
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:28,980
Forum friends and they were all sharing

708
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,220
information

709
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,099
about clubs it was all song Army weed

710
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:37,919
I totally I I remember seeing some of

711
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:40,259
your posts so it was like that's wild so

712
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,059
the threads yeah so it's like it's funny

713
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,940
now it's uh

714
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,980
yeah it's come full circle yeah I'm

715
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,860
gonna revive I mean we're gonna do a new

716
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,798
brand called sea of green for the bigger

717
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:55,319
space in Reading yeah and drop the Army

718
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,599
because I don't think I ever wanted Army

719
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,460
to be in my company name to be honest

720
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,158
like if my younger self I would have

721
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,259
never said Pixar Army is legal one brand

722
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,960
but you know I I want to try to soften

723
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:09,298
it up a bit uh as we start producing the

724
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,640
soccer mom it out a little yeah a little

725
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:14,099
bit because I mean I I'm not in the Army

726
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,380
like you know no one in our company went

727
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,480
to the Army it was a military mentality

728
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,760
that's what it's all about you know it

729
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,980
was like we had an army of plants and an

730
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:24,960
army of workers because it what it took

731
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,960
you know an army of houses actually at

732
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,579
that point yeah things were a lot

733
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,380
different back in the day like if you

734
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:32,699
wanted to scale you didn't scale to a

735
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,320
warehouse typically I mean some of you

736
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,519
guys did there were people that did it

737
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,798
out there but a lot of times it was

738
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,658
scale like in Monopoly in Monopoly you

739
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:40,740
get another house you get another house

740
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,880
you can get another house and you get

741
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,339
another house and I have friends that

742
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,559
had 12 houses my business partner he had

743
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,058
15 houses I believe yeah you know it's I

744
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,339
was happy with my a lighter for the most

745
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:52,319
part and at one point I got a 50 lighter

746
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:54,418
but like there was a basement in the

747
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,178
house but it was houses right you know

748
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,159
that was that was how it was before

749
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:01,320
2012. yeah you worked within 200 amps

750
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,120
yeah if you're you figured out how to

751
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,819
make it work you know maybe you can't

752
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,558
turn on the the microwave and you're

753
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,058
definitely flip-flopping probably yeah

754
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:10,440
space if you're doing it yeah if you're

755
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:11,460
doing it if you're maximizing it

756
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,240
correctly

757
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:17,880

um interesting now multi-tiered so two

773
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:58,079
level uh indoor living soil grows yeah

774
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:59,700
just perfection spectacular yeah he does

775
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,259
a pretty good job especially at scale

776
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,778
you're not seeing anybody else trying to

777
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:05,879
do that at scale and not only anybody

778
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:08,519
else trying to scale but two-tier scale

779
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,980
you know and those beds move like butter

780
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,960
right they really do pretty crazy right

781
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,058
he's so much space he had more space

782
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,220
than Hydro Growers I see between the

783
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,778
tears I thought it was awesome yeah

784
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,100
yeah yeah yeah I think he's doing a

785
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:22,619
really good job I think he's on to

786
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,639
something with the living soil organic I

787
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:25,199

um Planet Hulk in it so that has Bruce

814
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,720
Banner with our pink animal crackers

815
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,879
awesome yeah so that's a good one

816
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,720
actually yeah I forgot about that one

817
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,000
yes yes I there's some Growers uh

818
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,640
phenotype Hunters out of Michigan that's

819
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,558
pulling three pounds of light on here

820
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,720
so three pounds of light is good okay

821
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,398
yeah that's awesome I think if you can

822
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,720
get three pounds of light of good flour

823
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,219
you're doing good I mean there's guys

824
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,860
that get five pounds of light but is it

825
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,480
good I mean I'm not really into that I

826
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:59,479
want quality at the end of the day

827
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,500
exactly

828
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,960
you guys are working on collaborations

829
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,640
let's talk about those yeah so I found

830
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,620

833
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:16,619
days you guys met on the forums yeah on

834
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,360
icy mag or on overgrown or which um I

835
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,459
didn't know them on overgrow but I

836
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:24,479
wasn't overgrow

837
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:27,480
um HDTV 420 was my moniker that's

838
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,720
awesome but uh yeah and so yeah I mean

839
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,720
we really became friends at uh I see mag

840
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,839
yeah yeah our friend Bacchus

841
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,298
um who ran a library back in the day

842
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:41,819
introduced us oh cool and uh he had like

843
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,859
a pretty substantial clone Library I

844
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,119
don't know amazing yeah I don't know if

845
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:47,359
people know but like back in the day

846
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,979
there's people in the forums that add

847
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,079
libraries of really sick genetics that

848
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,819
were clone onlys and if you you know we

849
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,220
kind of would develop friend trading

850
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:57,599
circles that right you know trade

851
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,579
genetics and he had the biggest library

852
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,178
I'd ever seen yeah at that point it was

853
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:06,480
crazy like 50 strains at least back then

854
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:09,899
at least yeah at least they were quality

855
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,240
so he had a lot of friends out here that

856
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:14,639
he would Source some from and he he

857
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,460
brought a lot of fire to the

858
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,640
old school new school just a mix of

859
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,140
everything it was what kind of stuff

860
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,919
we're going back what

861
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,778
um man in 15 years yeah so yeah this is

862
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,480
more old school so yeah more old school

863
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:32,278
but still like I guess I guess old

864
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,960
school now but I mean you know it's like

865
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:36,359
purple urkles and stuff like that or

866
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,100
like the ogs and stuff were purple

867
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,778
Oracle fire though like I like purple

868
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,699
it's you know it's not the biggest yield

869
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:43,319
or I don't think it's a really good

870
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,659
commercial strain or anything like that

871
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:47,579
but it's cool yeah you know I like GDP

872
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:49,559
too yeah I just don't like growing it

873
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:51,658
I'd rather you grow GDP and all buyers

874
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,339
right I just yeah exactly it's one of

875
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,679
those ones like because I used to grow I

876
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:57,359
grew a lot of GDP 31 days of [ __ ] every

877
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,278
time back in the daily well it's just

878
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,599
such a short squatty plant and the thing

879
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,599
is if you don't veg it long enough you

880
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:06,359
don't get big enough buds right so

881
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,240
yeah GDP was cool yeah it was like the

882
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,678
the Fino I had was dark purple you know

883
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,579
it was dark purple and it was like

884
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,580
[ __ ] candy yes

885
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:20,158
but floral gas you know I was like

886
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,940
that's straight up like lavendery

887
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,440
flowery floral character with that with

888
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,038
the gas and I had a nice gas to it too

889
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,159
so yeah so we met back on the forums in

890
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,119
the days and then uh we eventually met

891
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,778
at one of the shows here in California

892
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,298
one of the events and uh like High Times

893
00:33:38,778 --> 00:33:44,519
I think Emerald is

894
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:46,619
yeah one of the real events yeah awesome

895
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,440
yes the true events

896
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:52,018
um and so yeah and so we've stayed in

897
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,778
touch ever since and you know

898
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,659
um he's got great respect for his

899
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:59,759
growing skills his flower uh he sells

900
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,278
out all the time so

901
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:06,240
um he puts his weed where his mouth is

902
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:07,159
yeah gotta respect that so he's all

903
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,099
about

904
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:14,820
quality and top shelf you know and I

905
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:17,940
think you know that's what I've been

906
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,399
learning from both of you is that it's

907
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,159
all about the quality and anything

908
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,079
that's not there doesn't hit on all

909
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,119
cylinders and you know it's not worth

910
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,539
growing yeah so and we want to

911
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,780
differentiate ourselves uh with that

912
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:36,059
fine quality and I I think people notice

913
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,679
yes you guys get to see a sold out show

914
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:41,639
at the fox of Larry June the other night

915
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,579
huh oh yeah how was that old school like

916
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,980
vibes okay like it was a great Vibe yeah

917
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:49,980
Larry Jean's not the best performer oh

918
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,838
wow but like it was great it was really

919
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,699
great show like the crowd was cool I

920
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,440
don't think he expected to see all those

921
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,759
shares sold out from how he acted

922
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,200
because it seemed like it was like one

923
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,060
show sold out and then he did another

924
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,879
one and another one so he's super hyped

925
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:05,039
on it that's so funny in uh 20 years ago

926
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
I almost now I went and toured the Fox

927
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,279
Theater when they were they went

928
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,240
bankrupt and they basically it was for

929
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,680
sale and uh we didn't have the 10

930
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,479
million dollars that they wanted for

931
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,519
that place but it's worth every penny

932
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,440
that place for 10 million dollars would

933
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,838
have killed it so I'm not sure exactly

934
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,599
how they got it back but it's beautiful

935
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,880
it's beautiful there's so much history

936
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,640
there so in in that one building and

937
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,380
good Acoustics good Acoustics yeah we

938
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,159
were feeling that baby just don't leave

939
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,160
anything in your car

940
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,740
Uber Uber is a good idea

941
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,720
yeah that that area is just a rough area

942
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:45,598
for parking and for theft you know

943
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,098
people breaking windows and uh I've had

944
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,920
Windows broken and there was nothing in

945
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,780
the car I've had uh stuff where there

946
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,780
was stuff in the car with Jason from

947
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,280
House of cultivar he was in town and we

948
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,440
had our luggage

949
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,079
and he had put his luggage in the back

950
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,639
seat uh and they [ __ ] broke the

951
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,099
window took everything it was really

952
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,900
rough so oh man but that's Oakland for

953
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,820
you you know you just gotta be smart

954
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,559
Keep Your Head on a swivel same thing

955
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,900
floor flame is not the safest area those

956
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,759
guys have been getting hit over and over

957
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,858
and over what a nightmare I think I hit

958
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,839
more than once oh yeah the guys have

959
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,279
come back multiple times and then they

960
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:23,219
had it on the news I don't know if you

961
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,680
saw the news commercial forklift lifting

962
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:27,239
up their gate and the big thing is is

963
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,098
like even if they don't get flour a lot

964
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,618
of times they do damage to your property

965
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,180
right so the property damage costs money

966
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,099
it's not like Insurance just covers

967
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:37,019
everything and or if it is Insurance

968
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,220
there's deductibles you know so people

969
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,739
are like well it's no big deal they

970
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:43,199
didn't get any flower they did damage

971
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:45,959
sure true still expensive still

972
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,639
expensive everything costs money

973
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,380
especially with the facility you look

974
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,759
you look you look at your equipment the

975
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,059
wrong way and it's another five thousand

976
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,339
dollars so yeah easily you go try to

977
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:58,139
Tinker on your ACS bad idea they're

978
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:01,139
definitely gonna do that right don't do

979
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:02,759
that yeah get a certified AC Tech

980
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:06,539
absolutely

981
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,640
so so we final hunt uh I got I end up

982
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,920
with the pink Zaza two years ago or

983
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,900
something and Rick and I trade clones

984
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,760
yeah so

985
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,639
um and have always traded clones freely

986
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,900
like back and forth and I sent it to

987
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:23,460
Rick I was like you gotta check it out

988
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:27,240
yeah and so I sent him the pink ZaZa and

989
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,280
we think that's probably gonna be some

990
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,139
of the better collaborations we've done

991
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,019
together we did a blue mosa collab too

992
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:36,299
that worked out really really well nice

993
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:38,338
awesome blue s once and then some blue

994
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,079
Mouse hybrids with the blue Hulk and or

995
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:41,578
the Incredible Hulk and you're then

996
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,619
selling the flower and you're selling

997
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,180
the seat yeah your guys are selling them

998
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:47,519
together basically

999
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,618
that basically is seeds yeah

1000
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,679
um in the flower yeah he does eat I do

1001
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:55,019
flour yeah and then I select and um yeah

1002
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:56,940
sometimes he selects yeah part of part

1003
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:58,619
of our process here is to actually have

1004
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,858
the flower of all the seeds that we make

1005
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:03,480
so we'll have samples we don't have a

1006
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:05,039
lot of it but I can give you an example

1007
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,900
of anything that we have on our menu

1008
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,420
there'll be a flower sample to back

1009
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:13,019
whether it's clone you know we're doing

1010
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,320
some interesting CBD stuff cbv

1011
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:18,358
um you know thcv so yeah it's it's wild

1012
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
but we want to have samples of

1013
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:21,838
everything available especially like

1014
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,639
when we go to shows in California we

1015
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,440
will have flower samples we have

1016
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,659
cultivation Partners too

1017
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,119
so that's great because I that's what I

1018
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:32,219
think an educated consumer is looking

1019
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,440
for yeah and I think it's the future I

1020
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:36,000
think everyone it's it's just a standard

1021
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,700
that should be the norm

1022
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,579
you know correct yeah and that requires

1023
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:43,139
planning planning and patience and all

1024
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,420
those good things for sure

1025
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,279
but but anything good takes time and

1026
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,680
requires a lot of planning yeah right

1027
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,780
more than you would ever think and it's

1028
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,940
execution

1029
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,920
execution and organization I think

1030
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,900
organization is huge we both kind of

1031
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,380
talked about you know note taking we

1032
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,180
talked about grinding uh yeah so if you

1033
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,800
were to talk to your younger self with

1034
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,598
all the vast experience you've acquired

1035
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,060
over these years and you talk to

1036
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,280
yourself there is one or two years in

1037
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,358
the industry what advice would you give

1038
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,740
yourself

1039
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:14,699
boy

1040
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,578
um

1041
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,618
probably to

1042
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,740
uh double check

1043
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:24,559
to make sure that uh

1044
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:27,959
we understand

1045
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,480
where the plants are and trying to keep

1046
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,220
them

1047
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,440
happier than we already do yeah because

1048
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,118
it's a challenge it was a balance so you

1049
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,579
have so many different things in the

1050
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,760
works that you know one thing is off

1051
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,220
kilter and it affects everything so you

1052
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,160
know just be able to

1053
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,659
um take that extra time to do

1054
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,539
um some double checking because I think

1055
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:53,819
it's really worthwhile yeah BJ said

1056
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,800
grinding tell yourself crying harder

1057
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,320
than you ever thought you could yeah

1058
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,019
yeah that's part of it absolutely it's

1059
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,780
like going to a strip club

1060
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:05,460
yeah yeah right

1061
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,440
stripper mentality and definitely super

1062
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,358
mentality if your money's working yeah

1063
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,420
work hard though no it's about hard work

1064
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:15,838
for sure yeah yeah hard work and working

1065
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,280
smart yeah yeah I mean for sure I think

1066
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,799
you need to work smart too that's

1067
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,180
definitely a great key point you know

1068
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,280
when we were younger I believe a lot of

1069
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:24,719
people said work smart not hard and my

1070
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,240
father was one of those people that said

1071
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,739
work smart but work your ass off work

1072
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,479
hard work smart you know and I think

1073
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:32,578
those two things things super important

1074
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,858
you know because there's other people

1075
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:36,480
doing it it's competitive you know

1076
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,699
that's why quality is so important it

1077
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,960
wasn't so important 20 years ago you

1078
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:41,759
could still sell your weed if you sucked

1079
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,199
at growing you suck at growing you don't

1080
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,000
sell your weed anymore you know even the

1081
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,399
homegirl guys it's done it's not

1082
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,099
expensive so it's so competitive so

1083
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,440
things like genetics play a huge key

1084
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:54,838
role in everything and also quality yeah

1085
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,179
absolutely yeah without you know that

1086
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,279
quality it's all for not I mean it's not

1087
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:00,598
what are you doing it for but I feel

1088
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,240
like a lot of guys in the guys I've

1089
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,240
interviewed lately and the people that

1090
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,618
are still here smiling uh are really

1091
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,199
passionate about what they do they love

1092
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,539
weed you know most of them smoke we all

1093
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,779
smoke you know so we and we're all

1094
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,219
roughly the same age and so we all went

1095
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,380
through the same trials and tribulations

1096
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:22,679
to a degree within the industry and we

1097
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:25,019
saw these changes from the 90s on up

1098
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:28,098
and it's a whole different world

1099
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:33,300
so yeah yeah it really is and I think

1100
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:37,380
with us uh individually working

1101
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:41,700
um with that passion but running at you

1102
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:46,140
know near capacity or a hundred percent

1103
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:49,259
um that just UPS the level of flower uh

1104
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:52,019
engine acts we create and that's what's

1105
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:55,619
going to set our work apart because

1106
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:57,719
we've taken the time to put in

1107
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:02,099
um all those steps and making sure that

1108
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:04,500
they flow correctly yeah so and that's

1109
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:07,859
what makes these kind of meetings fun

1110
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,380
because we get to look at each other's

1111
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:12,539
flower yeah I like seeing new stuff

1112
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,400
especially and I feel like

1113
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:16,500
especially with you we get to experience

1114
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,820
some new crosses together and it's like

1115
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,400
some new stuff I've never seen before

1116
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:23,400
and that raspberry Boogie has this real

1117
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,160
sourness that's really it's almost musky

1118
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,619
but not musky it's definitely insincy

1119
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:31,618
tiny little bit but like in a good way

1120
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,019
yeah like nag champa-ish yeah with a

1121
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,940
nice bouquet yeah with a few nice

1122
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,800
beautiful bouquet that's loud I mean

1123
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,700
that stuff is loud and it smokes loud

1124
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,920
and

1125
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:42,179
yeah you get fruit you get a lot of

1126
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,358
character it's like eating a whole meal

1127
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:48,239
dessert organic dessert fresh berries

1128
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,679
speaking of which we have a little

1129
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,059
flower if you want to take a look at her

1130
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:56,098
sure

1131
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:58,019
this is the Zero's raspberry Boogie bomb

1132
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,180
oh yeah

1133
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:01,880
it's all familiar I wouldn't kick her

1134
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:04,980
out of bed for eating crackers

1135
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,338
it's a good one that's really nice so

1136
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,818
this one also has that funkiness yeah so

1137
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,818
where it's like

1138
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,838
it's funny because like it's from the

1139
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:18,599
series yeah it's serious seriously

1140
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,639
interesting um but it smells like it's

1141
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,220
not like pine needles but it smells like

1142
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,400
a forest like I get this Forest smell to

1143
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:28,559
it I get like this creamy

1144
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,599
sweetness to it it's got this Razz sour

1145
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,059
raspberry like sour cherry and raspberry

1146
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,880
maybe yeah

1147
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:37,739
but really really exciting

1148
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,180
and if it translates in the Smoke which

1149
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:41,578
I'm sure it will it's going to be like

1150
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:43,679
really really enjoyable but it's like I

1151
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,619
like these complex smokes I really like

1152
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,960
complex flavor profiles yeah it's like

1153
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,760
my problem with the Asian Orange from

1154
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,980
subcool back in the day

1155
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,200
was that it was straight orange like

1156
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,639
actually House of cultivar had a Fino of

1157
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,919
Agent Orange that wasn't straight orange

1158
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,420
but like all the other ones I saw and

1159
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,318
all the flower I saw coming out of

1160
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,760
humble

1161
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:04,440
that was agent orange because that was

1162
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,180
easy when people were busting those out

1163
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,000
back in the day you know and this is

1164
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:10,980
like 15 years ago maybe

1165
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,599
that agent orange was straight orange it

1166
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,940
was there was no complexity to it it

1167
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,859
wasn't even as complex as Tangy and you

1168
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,539
know tangie's pretty pretty orange but

1169
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:21,480
there's a little rind yeah it was like

1170
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,818
straight limousine yeah yeah and it was

1171
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,079
just like orange cleaner yeah it was

1172
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:26,400
like orange cleaner that's what I

1173
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,140
thought of it and it wasn't cleaner like

1174
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,838
the burning your nose kind of cleaner it

1175
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:32,039
was like missing that part of it so Mr

1176
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:35,699
Clean like

1177
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:39,179
yeah yeah you have a very linear you

1178
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:40,500
know mono turpish where you know it's

1179
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:42,000
like but but like something like this

1180
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,079
this is the complete opposite end of the

1181
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,940
spectrum this is where you got

1182
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,500
complexity where you smell it and

1183
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,940
there's so many different recognizable

1184
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,880
smells but you got to kind of pick them

1185
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,900
apart yeah yeah very much so and this

1186
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:58,260
one is our collaboration uh with uh BJ

1187
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,200
SOG Army that is the zope to the pink

1188
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,240
Zaza so this stuff looks freaking nuts

1189
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,318
dude this is I mean you got Sugar Leaf

1190
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:08,578
on here and the Sugar Leaf is just sugar

1191
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,039
so we leave it on because it's so

1192
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:14,280
crusted with

1193
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:16,318
and so this one has that orange rind it

1194
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,900
has a little bit of that rind in there

1195
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,880
I'm a huge fan of that rind uh when it's

1196
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,039
subtle like that you know and it's

1197
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,039
complex it's another complex one

1198
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,719
and this is The Offspring of our seeds

1199
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,699
you know that yeah there's a little bit

1200
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,318
close to this too I like that that's

1201
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:33,358
something this is nice

1202
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:36,420
like it reminds it's a funny thing is

1203
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,098
like I took bubble baths as a kid and

1204
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,539
some of us like my parents you know when

1205
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,519
we were little kids I remember taking a

1206
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:44,818
I mean this is like

1207
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,739
40 years ago like Mr Bubble Mr Mr

1208
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:48,838
Bubbles

1209
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:51,239
that's what this is it has a Mr Bubble

1210
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:53,039
smell to it underneath well we have

1211
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:55,078
Bubba smells like name so yeah I mean

1212
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:58,019
Bubba smells like Irish Springs a little

1213
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,519
bit you know like Bubba Kush it has more

1214
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:02,338
of the Irish Springs kind of bubble

1215
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:05,099
smell and this is more like bubble bath

1216
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,599
this to Bubble yeah like straight up

1217
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,519
nostalgic from when I was a

1218
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,859
five-year-old kid you know yeah yeah

1219
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,780
that's what I love about flower though

1220
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:15,539
like being able to bring back memories

1221
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,579
of being a kid yes you know I can't even

1222
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:19,980
though the last time I thought about

1223
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:22,619
like bubble baths or like kids bubble

1224
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,240
baths I don't have kids unfortunately

1225
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,700
more fortunately I guess depending on

1226
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,799
how you're looking at it yeah so it's

1227
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:30,419
one of those mixed things it's like it'd

1228
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
be great to have kids in some ways but

1229
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,838
in other ways it's great to be able to

1230
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,760
travel and to see the world and

1231
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,078
you know absolutely yeah for sure I'll

1232
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,900
be like SoMo I'll have kids when I'm

1233
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,240
like 60. that's what I'm hoping for too

1234
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,639

1235
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:47,219
