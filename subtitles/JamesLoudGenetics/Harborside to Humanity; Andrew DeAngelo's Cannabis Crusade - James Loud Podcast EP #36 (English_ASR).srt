00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,039
long history with cannabis yep you and

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,679

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,199
projects and Ventures like

00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,280
Harborside and but you go back into uh

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,480
cannabis even further than that I would

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,920
assume and also I I've read some stuff

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:43,000
about you acting years ago yes so I'm

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,120
proud to say 2023 is my 40th anniversary

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,119
in the Cannabis trade I started in high

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,759
school so in those days we were

19
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,599
underground man everything was

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:57,198
underground and so my brother and I

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,039
started working that market and did it

22
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,280
pretty well in our hometown Washington

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,478
DC and um my brother had an old friend

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,478
out in San Francisco named Dennis Peron

25
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,519
and Dennis Peron was working to legalize

26
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,759
medical out here first in the city of

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:15,719
San Francisco in '92 and then Statewide

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,200
in 96 yeah so in those days you're

29
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,239
listeners might not know but there was a

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,920
little split in the Cannabis movement

31
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:24,319
some of us split it over into Industrial

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Hemp because Jack Herr's book had just

33
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,279
been published and and we're like oh wow

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
we can make all this stuff out of hemp

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,719
let's start hemp company so me and

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
brother started a hemp company and then

37
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,560
cats like Dennis Peron was like no no

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,000
it's medicine let's start let's start

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,799
the medical cannabis Revolution it turns

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,599
out Dennis was

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,200
right and we were wrong um uh but

42
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,359
eventually you know because we had a

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,759
robust wholesale business underground we

44
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,519
were able to send Dennis a bunch of

45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,239
money for those initiatives you

46
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,759
mentioned me being an actor I was in

47
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:01,359
acting school here in San Francisco um

48
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,599
when those initiatives were happening

49
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:07,319
early 90s and I would buy and sell

50
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,758
cannabis to Dennis because he was

51
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,280
basically the only dispensary in the

52
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,159
world at that point and he had opened up

53
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,360
different storefronts and

54
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,159
different I remember the one of the

55
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,800
first ones was above the transfer bar on

56
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:25,959
Market Market Street um and it was a

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,760
little gay bar right right there at the

58
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,239
mun stop right in front of the Safeway

59
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,919
there and above there was like this

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,599
space and Dennis rent at that space and

61
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,799
you could fit I don't know 50 or 100

62
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,878
people in there and it was always packed

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,760
wow um and you know they would buzz you

64
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,560
in in those days you get buzzed in uh uh

65
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,759
to the dispensaries and you know and

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,039
everybody Dennis my brother and I

67
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,759
everybody a lot of people in the

68
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,519
movement I can't say everybody but a lot

69
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,399
of people in the movement wanted to get

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
legal we were tired of getting busted

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Dennis had gotten badly busted my

72
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,878
brother gotten busted I got I had not

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,719
yet gotten busted busted at that point

74
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:07,840
but I have of course a couple arrests in

75
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,120
my in my career too and we didn't like

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,640
hiding from the world we didn't like

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,920
being criminals we didn't like getting

78
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,878
chased by cops um and it was a really

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,359
hard way to live so once we

80
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,000
legalized uh in California my brother

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,799
and I did the same thing in our hometown

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,199
in Washington DC two years later

83
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,319
1998 uh the federal government would not

84
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:31,000
allow us to implement that law the the

85
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:32,518
the the way the District of Columbia

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,400
works the federal government funds the

87
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,000
District of Columbia so they would not

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
appropriate the funds to implement the

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,639
program well and then a year or two

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,039
after that my brother got busted really

91
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,719
badly and you know we knew it was time

92
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,719
that we had to leave our hometown and

93
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,759
come out to

94
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,359
California um my acting career was going

95
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,120
pretty good in the 90s um but there came

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,239
a split in the road for me you know

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,239
there was no way that I could acting's a

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
full more than a full-time job

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,158
right you know and cannabis is more than

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,000
a full-time job they're both Lifestyles

101
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:10,560
and they're just brutally hard

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,280
professions that require you know 18

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,079
hour days being on all the time and and

104
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,000
so I I I realized I was also getting you

105
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,439
know Hollywood's a very young town I

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,160
mean once you get approaching 30 if you

107
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,759
haven't made it yet you know you have to

108
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,520
start thinking about different ways to

109
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,479
be a Storyteller maybe um and so and you

110
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,399
know we had had this bus and my parents

111
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,959
were elderly I had to take care of my

112
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,198
family that was that was the most

113
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,680
important thing

114
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,038
so then we started Harborside in' 06 you

115
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,400
know that was a medical dispensary I'm

116
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,519
sure we'll talk a little bit more about

117
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,519
that yeah and um and in those days there

118
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,560
were no Labs there were no investment

119
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,959
groups there were no packaging

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,720
companies so we started all those as

121
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,439
well the ark View group Steep Hill Labs

122
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,960
canaline packaging um to try to create

123
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,478
infrastructure for the industry to use

124
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,560
in those days the city of Oakland and

125
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,918
most places in the state were barely

126
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,639
licensing retail they certainly weren't

127
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,719
licensing Growers and breeders and you

128
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,960
know those folks were still getting

129
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,000
busted you know by the state by the Feds

130
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,198
all over the place and um so we wanted

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to build that infrastructure we knew the

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
day was going to come where lab testing

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,720
of a cannabis was going to have to

134
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:30,079
happen just to make things copesthetic

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,360
with the general public for a while

136
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,240
well we knew that elected official of

137
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,199
politicians were going to need that so

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,400
we wanted to Pioneer these things same

139
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,038
thing with the child resistant packaging

140
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,758
right and you know Harborside and other

141
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,199
of those first movers that did well we

142
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,400
didn't have any couldn't raise any money

143
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,520
it was a nonprofit model during the

144
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,198
medical and you know you go to investor

145
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,879
and like

146
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,120
nonprofit and they're like

147
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,519
bye-bye we've got other places to put

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,199
our money but um but I like the

149
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,959
nonprofit model because it really served

150
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,759
our community well right Growers and

151
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,519
breeders and Traders and Transporters

152
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,520
and manufacturers I mean we had most of

153
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:16,799
the products on Harborside shelf in

154
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:19,598
those early years came from very small

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,199
businesses people that were making stuff

156
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:24,918
in their kitchen people very Boutique

157
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,520
very craft and it was high quality stuff

158
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,598
I mean we didn't put anything on on our

159
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,879
if you didn't you know lot 90% of what

160
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,279
came in the purchasing door got rejected

161
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,159
yeah um but we would also give feedback

162
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,000
to folks so they can improve and get

163
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,360
better because you know when you tell

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,079
somebody no they get a little upset um

165
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,000
and so to say hey we think if you did

166
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,598
this that or the other you could improve

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,598
your products to to the point where we

168
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,000
could feel good about buying them we'd

169
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,800
even go to people's Farms you know and

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,598
and give them pointers we had some

171
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,840
brilliant brilliant subject matter

172
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:01,759
experts that we hired that that ran that

173
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,239
whole department and and so that was

174
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,120
harbor side and then you know the adult

175
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,439
use framework came along long time after

176
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,160
that right and that framework of course

177
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,439
is much different so had a big impact on

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,840
everybody in California so back in the

179
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,319
early days of Harbor Side you guys had

180
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,159
like the boutique Walmart of cannabis it

181
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,000
was it was a wild experience and you

182
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,400
guys also put a lot of money back into

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,199
the community you guys had massages and

184
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,038
you had other things that you know a lot

185
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,439
of places didn't have

186
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:35,038
free massages free uh you know and free

187
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,199
education you know you guys were

188
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,759
educating people for free but the

189
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,879
quality of the products I mean you guys

190
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,598
had really good quality flour right from

191
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,039
the G I can remember the sage and sour

192
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,439
that you guys had was the best sage and

193
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,439
sour I've ever seen yeah you know came

194
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,918
from a dispensary so and I I think a lot

195
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,519
of people think of it the opposite now

196
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:55,198
where the craft stuff is all it's true

197
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,198
it's the opposite now CU all those folks

198
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,879
had to go underground yeah um because

199
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,960
they couldn't comply with the 64

200
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,000
framework some a lot of people tried to

201
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,198
comply yeah and failed and then they

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,839
went back underground a lot of people

203
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,598
you and I know this man they got one

204
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,239
foot in both markets and that's how

205
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,560
they've managed to survive this

206
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,199
framework which is really broken in

207
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,639
California you know it's a really sad

208
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,840
thing that we have this tragic man

209
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,000
tragic well it's like the whole Let's uh

210
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,959
reschedule instead of deschedule that's

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,158
the whole you know it's unbelievable

212
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:31,038
that we're even having this conversation

213
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:33,799
yeah it really is I mean descheduling is

214
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,559
the obvious choice for anybody on the

215
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,478
policy Spectrum unless you're just a

216
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,838
hardcore prohibitionist right right and

217
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,879
um the the science is there the studies

218
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,959
are there yeah there's proof yeah

219
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,399
there's all kinds of proof you hear the

220
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,919
elected officials especially at the

221
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,278
national lever say oh we got to study it

222
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,399
more we haven't studied it are you

223
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,439
kidding me what's been studied more than

224
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,000
cannabis in the whole world I mean I can

225
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,760
think of very few things that have been

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,078
studied more than cannabis maybe

227
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:04,120
petroleum um or mining or something um

228
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:06,439
but it's been a very difficult Road and

229
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,159
and a lot of people couldn't make it um

230
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,320
and and and folks are not going to just

231
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,958
let their businesses die right if

232
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,839
they're able to they're going to play in

233
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,439
both markets and a lot of people are

234
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,680
doing that in in in California right now

235
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,600
yeah and people are going to do whatever

236
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,838
it takes to survive at the end of the

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,240
day yep yep so so don't get too famous

238
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,920
don't come on James show if you're doing

239
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,120
that right totally all eyes on the

240
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,958
show but yeah it's it's really

241
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,799
interesting the the uphill battle from

242
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,919
the

243
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,559
beginning from from the early days to

244
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,559
where it is today and it's changed a lot

245
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,919
it still has a long way to go y long

246
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,719
long way to go and it's really

247
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,679
interesting because I feel like the

248
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,920
general consensus if you ask people all

249
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:57,759
over the United States is more than 50%

250
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:01,479
are okay with it so I think we're at 65%

251
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,639
for adult and 95 for medical in the

252
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,000
polls right now well it's hard to argue

253
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,399
the medical that that's the biggest

254
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,360
thing is like I don't get that 5% are

255
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,240
just bad people that they don't want

256
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,560
people healthy well yes and they're they

257
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,680
they have a lot of stigma and they they

258
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,119
still feel that get the getting high

259
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,278
part is more harmful than the medicinal

260
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,839
part yeah and so that's they're just

261
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,159
super conservative people and you know

262
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,800
we I don't know man the mainstream

263
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,159
population of the United States is

264
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:35,359
pretty conservative yeah so you know we

265
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:38,439
have to do a good job policing ourselves

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,639
um and and whether it

267
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,399
be how we brand our products you know

268
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,480
make sure that they're they're not

269
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,200
appealing to kids or they're not

270
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,000
knocking off other mainstream products

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,120
that are in the marketplace okay that's

272
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,519
a recipe for disaster for everybody um

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,519
and because there's all kinds of ways to

274
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,480
tell our stories and you know our

275
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,440
stories are amazing they're phenomenal

276
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,480
stories very few

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,120
people live the kind of life we do okay

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,079
very few people take the kind of risk we

279
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,159
do very few people have the adventures

280
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,638
we do the experiences absolutely the

281
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:19,240
experiences right and so it it's a very

282
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:23,480
rich life to live and

283
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:26,159
and but we that are in that bubble we

284
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,440
have to be mindful that it is a bubble

285
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,519
and the folks outside of it have a lot

286
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,639
of concerns man I've been all over this

287
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,679
country building dispensaries and grows

288
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,079
and other things and the local people

289
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:43,239
really H still have a hard time with

290
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:45,120
this okay in most places um and it seems

291
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,799
absurd to us because it feels like we've

292
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,919
just been educating and educating and

293
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,399
educating for years and years and years

294
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,639
um but we just have to stay on that and

295
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,679
and make sure that we're not just

296
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,759
policing ourselves but providing good

297
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,479
solid

298
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,879
information cuz I I don't know how you

299
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,560
feel about it James but the consumer

300
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,958
seems very confused to me right now I

301
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,239
agree I mean it's the markets aren't

302
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,919
stable you know for one thing California

303
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,919
especially you know me being from

304
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,799
California but also I work in Washington

305
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,519
and I go to Colorado quite often and

306
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,719
those markets a little more mature than

307
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,679
California there's a trust with Brands

308
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,959
more so and I feel like we need to get

309
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,919
that trust as Californians we need to

310
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,479
get that trust with our consumers you

311
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,360
know and I think running it like a real

312
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,000
business is one thing but also having

313
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,399
good quality product so they can have a

314
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,679
reliable source they can go to I mean I

315
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,958
think those things are huge but also

316
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,599
just running these things like real

317
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,359
businesses you know I mean that's that's

318
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
what's going to make the difference

319
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,278
right you know professionalism goes a

320
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,240
very long way and just being excellent

321
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:52,360
you know is you know when I look at your

322
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,480
facility here it it's been you've cared

323
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,480
for it you've put a lot of effort into

324
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,440
making it look and feel and be excellent

325
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,039
and as long as we do that we're going to

326
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,279
be okay because the the the Baseline in

327
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,679
the mainstream Society is not excellent

328
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:10,720
I mean look around so um you know you

329
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:13,439
can count on a few hands you know

330
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,720
amazing experiences Apple Stores or

331
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
perhaps one of them right amazing they

332
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,720
didn't have to do that they're Apple to

333
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,639
sell it yeah you know but they did it

334
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,759
they spent you know tens of millions of

335
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,720
dollars on the Apple Stores um I'm lucky

336
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,759
enough to have one of their leaders who

337
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,199
did that in my cons in Co-op but um but

338
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,759
you know if we can create experiences

339
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:39,799
that allow people to say wow wow wow and

340
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,600
then when they get home and they hit the

341
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,519
weed or they take the edible or whatever

342
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,040
it is that pre-roll and it tastes

343
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,879
amazing and it gives you a great effect

344
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,278
wow you know I love the pre-roll so

345
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,759
that's that's just my thing is I love

346
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,879
the pre-roll because you're not looking

347
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,680
at the flower you're looking at it from

348
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,759
a taste perspective and you're looking

349
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,278
at it from an effect yes right and so

350
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,680
you can get rid of the hype to a lot of

351
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:02,958
the degree it doesn't have to look like

352
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,319
this amazing thing it could be the

353
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,359
ugliest butt in the world but if it

354
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,120
tastes great if it gives you a good

355
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,919
effect that's really what counts at the

356
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,440
end of the day so and it's about the

357
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,559
experience we start talking about

358
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,160
experiences and I love that because I

359
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,399
feel like cannabis is such a great

360
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,240
experience but anymore you used to be

361
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,679
able to get by by giving people a

362
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,600
mediocre experience with cannabis it had

363
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,039
to get people High pretty much and if

364
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,320
you grew stuff that got people high you

365
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:29,759
were okay now you have to have the best

366
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,800
[ __ ] of if you want to survive you have

367
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,120
to have some of the best cannabis you

368
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,359
know and it doesn't matter whether

369
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,240
you're black market or White Market if

370
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,519
you're in wck you have to grow the best

371
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,198
stuff because the price is so much lower

372
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,440
that to be in that upper echelon you you

373
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,439
got to grow quality yeah there's always

374
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,480
room at the top there's always for

375
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,480
everything and there's that 1% rule as

376
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,759
long as you fit into that 1% you're

377
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,879
going to be okay and that almost

378
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,399
transcends everything yeah I I I

379
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,958
couldn't agree more that's what I work

380
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,440
really hard with my clients on is let's

381
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,879
get to that l level it was going to take

382
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,399
more time to get to that level it's

383
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,958
probably going to take more resources to

384
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,559
get to that level but when you get to

385
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,000
that level when headwinds occur in the

386
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,599
market because the supply chains are

387
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,278
fragile yeah uh and they're being you

388
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,759
know you're building them while you're

389
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,000
flying the airplane right and so

390
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,759
sometimes airplanes crash when you're

391
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,919
building them flying them at the same

392
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,560
time and and so those Market headwinds

393
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:32,078
if you're at that top 1% and people just

394
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,239
are loyal to your product yeah they

395
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,719
might buy a little less of it during

396
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,440
hard Economic Times and you know

397
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,079
supplement their purchase with something

398
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,759
that's more value centered but they will

399
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:45,838
not abandon you ever right because one

400
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,399
of the

401
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,800
things I've learned being a stoner I'm

402
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,839
sure you've learned it too we always

403
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,679
want to put the best cannabis in our

404
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,800
bodies that we possibly can we will

405
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:02,239
search long and far uh to get to get

406
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:04,958
something that really pops right and um

407
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,000
so that's what and when more and more

408
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,078
people become cannabis enthusiasts that

409
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,759
same Dynamic is going to happen right

410
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,799
they're going to want something that

411
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,278
really pops eventually right eventually

412
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,159
once you get on that spectrum and you be

413
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:21,078
go from Cannabis curious to full-on

414
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:24,679
Stoner right then you then you're like

415
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:26,479
okay um let's let's see what what what I

416
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,000
can do with this a little bit more on

417
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,360
the quality scale right well it's just

418
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,159
like with everything I feel like data

419
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,360
points as as you've experienced it more

420
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,159
the more times you've tried cannabis or

421
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,519
food you really learn more about

422
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,399
yourself and what you like and what you

423
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,198
don't like and so that's kind of what's

424
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,000
going on in California in my mind it's

425
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,240
like they go on Instagram or social

426
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,240
media and they see these Brands and

427
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
they're like oh yeah that must be good

428
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,759
because it's Snoop dogs or whatever and

429
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,278
you know I'm not saying anything bad

430
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,800
about Snoop dogs brand but I think

431
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,879
people are attracted to hip-hop or to

432
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,879
things that they can relate to so they

433
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,278
associate well maybe that's good but

434
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,600
really you you need to try several

435
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,159
different things figure out what's right

436
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,519
for you what kind of experience you want

437
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,159
to have all those things yeah why

438
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,879
wouldn't you have fun with that I mean

439
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,558
certainly try the celebrity Brands see

440
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
see what you think if they don't meet

441
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,678
your expectation you should let them

442
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,639
know yeah right um because all these

443
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,038
celebrity brands are licensing deals

444
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,160
basically um the the celebrity is not in

445
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,359
the garden snoop's not actually trimming

446
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,600
this week you know he's probably smoking

447
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,319
it though I should hope so I hope he's

448
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,599
smoking it um and even if to say go back

449
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,480
to the drawing board this doesn't

450
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,359
deserve to have my name on it yeah which

451
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,038
may happen I hope happens um for sure

452
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:43,279
but um but check out the craft Growers

453
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:46,200
check out the craft cannabis um because

454
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:49,918
one it's a community that deserves

455
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,640
support right and is worthy of abundance

456
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,960
they they Carri this plant through thick

457
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,880
and thin for 100 years and we have to

458
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,360
honor and respect that and plus they

459
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,960
grow great weed I mean they create great

460
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:05,439
products and it doesn't have a bunch of

461
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,000
fancy flashy marketing sometimes it may

462
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,880
not have an instore display they might

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,359
not be able to buy a shelf right but dig

464
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,159
around a little bit because it's not

465
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:20,599
hard to find um these products and you

466
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,520
can get now there's Sun and Earth

467
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:26,240
certified products that David Broner has

468
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,079
that program and and and that that goes

469
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,798
beyond Organics right so if you really

470
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,480
want clean cannabis check out Sun and

471
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,480
Earth certified cannabis right so we're

472
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,240
starting to get our act together in

473
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,558
terms of providing differentiation in

474
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,839
the marketplace between craft and

475
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,839
celebrity and also bigger companies

476
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,599
scaled companies like glass house or

477
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,959
something like that well and then we go

478
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,359
into terroir yes and that excites me too

479
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,519
you know it's like because I see what's

480
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,240
been done in the wine industry and I

481
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:57,918
think cannabis we've talked about it for

482
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
years but really it's gonna it's gonna

483
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,960
happen where you're going to be able to

484
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,600
go and I would love to see that as a

485
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,720
vertically integrated model where you

486
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,158
can go to the farm you can talk to the

487
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,880
guy who grew it you can hear about his

488
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,039
you know his parents who maybe grew it

489
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,919
or whatever and he can tell you the

490
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,640
story of why it's grown and why it

491
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,120
tastes like it tastes and yeah how it

492
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,280
feels and I mean I think that's just

493
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,759
such a beautiful thing that you know

494
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,639
this is like the Legacy that these

495
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,440
people will be leaving to their children

496
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,960
potentially and also a legacy for the

497
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,480
you know the Giants that came before us

498
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,038
in the industry yes and we're starting

499
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,558
to see the folks up in Humble Mendo in

500
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,359
that Community diversify themselves so

501
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,720
you're starting to see glamping models

502
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:42,240
on farms now where they where you can go

503
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,038
glamp and cut weed and consume weed and

504
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,599
be with weed and being a beautiful place

505
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,319
doesn't get much more beautiful than

506
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,798
humble or Mendo in the whole world so

507
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,319
we're starting to see that I think the

508
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,918
hospitality models are going to be big

509
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,158
and and and just like wineries right

510
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,919
wineries they have two ways that they

511
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,200
have three basic revenue streams one is

512
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,600
they sell wine in bulk to Distributors

513
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,080
right the alcohol industry has this

514
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,959
three- tiered system right you're either

515
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,879
a producer you're a distributor or

516
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,840
you're a retailer you can't be you can

517
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,720
only be one of those things unless

518
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,759
you're a producer you can sell direct at

519
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,519
your Winery to Consumers so that's the

520
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,440
second yeah um Revenue stream they have

521
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:27,599
and then the third Revenue stream is um

522
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,798
just you know all the extras that come

523
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,399
with the EXP experience of The Tasting

524
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:34,839
Room or you know some places do tours

525
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,519
some places do the glamping some places

526
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,918
um and and it's really some places have

527
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,639
a little food a little bit snacks you

528
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:47,440
know and so I think what we've seen with

529
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,400
wine tasting is an excellent model for

530
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,038
and terar I mean I'm a big fan of Swami

531
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,840
select Swami select is you know and he

532
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,480
grows in Mendo he's in Mendo and he

533
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,959
grows in the terar he actually puts his

534
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,720
plants in the ground they're not on a

535
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,798
they're not in a pot with bunch of soil

536
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,400
he brings from the outside totally he

537
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,918
regenerates that land he puts this you

538
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,038
know the melum in there and he just

539
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,640
creates the soil and then he it's right

540
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,480
there and that's the Appalachian and

541
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,080
they're close in Mendo and humble to

542
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,679
getting that done they've been working

543
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,798
on it for a few years now there's a lot

544
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,840
of constraints and issues with with that

545
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:27,000
program totally but it is a lot further

546
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,319
along now than it was three or four

547
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,480
years ago when people were first

548
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,240
starting to talk about it and you know

549
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,679
one of the constraints is a lot of that

550
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,919
land up

551
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,960
there wouldn't pass the lab tests if you

552
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,640
put Plants directly into the land

553
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,960
because it's a little bit dirty or it

554
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,759
has heavy metals in it or it's been

555
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,240
farmed or it's been loged or it's been

556
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,759
whatever right um so there's some work

557
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,319
that needs to be done to remediate that

558
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,839
um um because the Appalachian for me the

559
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:58,240
Appalachian thing doesn't work unless

560
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:02,918
you're planting in the actual ground and

561
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,400
soil of the of the region um and but

562
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,038
they've done a great job I mean there's

563
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
all these tiny little Appalachians

564
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:09,440
they're all next to each other they've

565
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,759
been named they've been mapped for the

566
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,038
most part right that that took years um

567
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:17,319
and it's all trying to get the community

568
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,038
again up there the craft producers to

569
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,480
have something that differentiates

570
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,319
themselves right because a big company

571
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,079
like my former company now called state

572
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,119
house or glass house they're all called

573
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,960
house for some reason I don't know why

574
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,199
um um but

575
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,640
they don't grow that way they they can't

576
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,759
grow that way they can't they would

577
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,520
never grow that way and so they'll never

578
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,679
get a Appalachian sure you know

579
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:44,599
designation on there and and and so if

580
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,159
we if the consumer starts digging this

581
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,158
right just like the wine people Bordeaux

582
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,799
yeah Bordeaux is Bordeaux Bordeaux is

583
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,960
Bordeaux absolutely it can't come from

584
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,480
anywhere else it's got to be C young

585
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,798
Mero and C Frank very strict rules very

586
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,038
strict rules

587
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:03,798
right it's serve them well okay to have

588
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,640
those strict rules um and so that's how

589
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:09,038
other Industries and I don't really like

590
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,840
comparing cannabis to alcohol very often

591
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,960
but I I I do see we're in California

592
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,359
we're talking about California the wine

593
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,558
industry is a dominant industry here I

594
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,599
don't know it's got to be top five

595
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:23,960
Industries in the state um and we have

596
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,879
to find these models you know because

597
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,240
we're building something from scratch

598
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,960
you know never been a 100 years of

599
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Prohibition is a long time you know to

600
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,360
there is no muscle memory there is there

601
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,400
isn't anyone alive who was around you

602
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:42,119
know um who could go into a drugstore in

603
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,798
San Jose in 1910 and buy a cannabis

604
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,319
tincture there there's just nobody that

605
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,000
that's around that that could do that so

606
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:53,200
it's up to us really

607
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,599
to Pioneer all of this and and protect

608
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,720
ourselves at the same time I mean one of

609
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,558
the things we've certainly seen is the

610
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,120
colonization of California cannabis in a

611
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,798
big way right so you know that's

612
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:10,239
something that has been one of the more

613
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:13,480
painful parts of the adult use framework

614
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,000
for everybody certainly for me and my

615
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,360
family but um but for a lot of people

616
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,679
and um you know it's been hard so

617
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,000
whatever advantages we can get we should

618
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,640
create for ourselves you know right yeah

619
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,159
so let's talk about the last prisoner

620
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,278
project you know I I'm good friends with

621
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,360
uh rich he's been on the show Steve's

622
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,519
been on the show and i' I'd love to get

623
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,839
your history of last prisoner project

624
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,599
and well my brother came to me one day

625
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,678
with a vision like he does with a lot of

626
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:43,480
things he did it with harbor side he did

627
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:47,159
it with all kinds of things in our

628
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,679
lives and it was great vision we were

629
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,600
still in the last year or two of our

630
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,480
Harborside Journey but we could see that

631
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:59,000
things were getting very transactional

632
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:03,558
in California and kind of effed up um

633
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,720
with everything so we wanted to get back

634
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,240
to Our Roots so we and at Harborside one

635
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,558
of the free programs we had you could

636
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,480
write a letter to a cannabis prisoner

637
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,319
and in exchange for that we'd give you a

638
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,558
free gram of of medicine uh so and you

639
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,480
know one of my earliest memories in the

640
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,000
and with cannabis is visiting my older

641
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,558
brother in prison when I was 9ine years

642
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,440
old uh so so we have this history and

643
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:30,000
this roots with cannabis prisoners me

644
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,720
and my brother and and as we wanted to

645
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,440
get back to that the the we wanted to do

646
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,120
something that was transcends

647
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,080
transactions and we had people that were

648
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,599
still locked up I mean my brother got

649
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,240
the idea because one of our friends was

650
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,240
locked up in Pennsylvania and called him

651
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,679
from prison in the middle of a big

652
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,480
investor meeting he was having and the

653
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,000
contrast between these investors talking

654
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,000
about you know billions of dollars worth

655
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,319
of weed cultivate it and transport and

656
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,759
sold and Chuck our friend he was I think

657
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,319
it was 16 pounds or something he was in

658
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,240
prison for um so that contrast was like

659
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,439
we got to do something about this and so

660
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,880
last prisoner project is a it started

661
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,399
about five years ago my brother and I

662
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,600
you know he came to me with the vision I

663
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:20,839
said yes let's do it yeah um and then we

664
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,639
got to work and you know what you need

665
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:26,359
when you build out an organization like

666
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,278
d you need a great team you need money

667
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:34,519
right um and you need a really tight

668
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:38,398
Mission um and you also need ongoing

669
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:40,200
support right um it's we started lpp

670
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:41,719
with our own money but that was not

671
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,319
sustainable given what was happening

672
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,919
with Harborside and everything else so

673
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,720
so we thought of different programs to

674
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,440
fund it we put together a team of people

675
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,720
from our Network that we loved and

676
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,640
thought were terrific pretty much all

677
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:00,480
women right um and and we got to work

678
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,159
and and and it the first year two was

679
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,640
brutally hard we almost had to fold the

680
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,240
organization on more than one occasion

681
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,600
wow

682
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,640
then 420 happened during the pandemic

683
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:18,398
2020 yeah and we did a fundraiser for

684
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,080
that with weed maps and some other folks

685
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,158
it was Big A lot of people saw it Willie

686
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,960
Nelson we did several fundraisers and we

687
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,000
introduced these programs roll it up for

688
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,399
justice and partners for Freedom roll it

689
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,798
up for justice is dispensaries can sign

690
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,879
up for that program and the change that

691
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:35,359
customers have 50 cents 20 cents

692
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,520
whatever the change is at the end of the

693
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:41,519
transaction gets donated to lpp doesn't

694
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,679
cost the dispensary any money right they

695
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,120
sometimes they put a little bucket by

696
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,159
the register and the chains goes in

697
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:49,319
there sometimes it's digital on the POS

698
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,039
system right um duy is our partner um

699
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,879
with that and they are matching dollar

700
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,759
for dooll or they were I think they

701
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,278
still are um and um that exposure we had

702
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,440
at 420 2020 and announcing those

703
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,319
programs and then our business

704
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,919
development team hit the streets after

705
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,678
that and we started to sign people up um

706
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,720
people we didn't even have to hit the

707
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,080
streets people would call us up and say

708
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,079
how do we get how do we do it you know

709
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:14,558
so the industry it was one of those

710
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,639
ideas my brother

711
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:21,599
had that everyone in the whole industry

712
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,038
just said yes yeah this is a good thing

713
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,558
it's easy to get it's easy to relate to

714
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,480
yeah I mean let's get let's get our

715
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,879
people out of prison man we legal come

716
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,159
on now so and there's thousands of

717
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,880
people just in federal lockup I think

718
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,120
it's 3,000 or 2900 something like that

719
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,278
yeah um State lock up a lot more than

720
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,199
that right and it's you know I talked to

721
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:47,038
a young man who served seven years in

722
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,038
Illinois Illinois is legal yeah well why

723
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,960
why is this guy still in prison makes

724
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,079
doesn't make any sense you know um

725
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,679
you've got some of the biggest msos

726
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:57,398
based in Illinois based in Chicago and

727
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,000
this guy's sitting in prison you know

728
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:04,439
for seven eight years um and so it's a

729
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,398
moral call it's a moral shout outout

730
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,159
it's a call to action it's a moral call

731
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:12,119
to action and I'm proud to say even

732
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,600
during a very difficult moment and I

733
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,319
can't tell you that our donations

734
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,558

so tell me about Harborside Farms you

797
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:47,158

798
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,360
it is today h that's a a great

799
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,200
question you know we've always been

800
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,759
traders of cannabis my my brother and I

801
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,840
we weren crowers right and I think it

802
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,879
was 2012 or maybe a couple years after

803
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,519
that the city of San Jose where we had a

804
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,440
very popular shop mhm changed their

805
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,880
framework and they required everyone to

806
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,480
be vertically integrated oh wow they

807
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,039
required everyone to be vertically

808
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,360
integrated so we didn't want to give up

809
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,839
that shop um and we started trying to

810
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,240
figure out how we can become vertically

811
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:22,038
integrated and it led us to Harborside

812
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,558
Farms what's now called Harborside farms

813
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:26,720
in the selenis valley at that time there

814
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,879
was not a single cannabis farm in that

815
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,440
entire Valley

816
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,639
and and so again Steve and and and and

817
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,558
and Harborside were pioneering something

818
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:41,119
in in a place it's too bad we couldn't

819
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,839
buy a bunch of farms around there and

820
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,479
and flipped them to some of the bigger

821
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:47,879
players that are down there now but um

822
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,839
but we were we were first down there and

823
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,679
um and we had to raise money you know we

824
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:56,839
had to raise money it's expensive to

825
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,759
grow cannabis in green houses or indoors

826
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,240
well they required you to retrofit if I

827
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,720
remember right it wasn't like you could

828
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,558
do new build outs it had to be

829
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,159
retrofited you couldn't do new build

830
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:08,079
outs unless yeah you had to get

831
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,080
permission for that and that was really

832
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:14,759
hard to get and we eventually were able

833
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:15,879
to build uh Dutch style Veno Greenhouse

834
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,359
there I remember when you guys were

835
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,399
building them they looked awesome what

836
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,759
our investors wanted to do was a little

837
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,879
different than what we wanted to do um

838
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:27,599
they were very interested in scale um

839
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,440
and we were

840
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:34,000
more oriented towards craft right um we

841
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,480
thought maybe you know the opportunity

842
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,638
down there was to to be almost more of a

843
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,159
nursery because we didn't need that much

844
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:45,278
weed for our own shops that you can grow

845
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,519
that's gigantic facility um that was one

846
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,079
area we diverged from our investors a

847
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,638
little bit and you know when we got

848
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,558
shored down there the farm was

849
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:57,519
struggling you know pretty bad um

850
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,278
unfortunately that little piece of land

851
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,200
is just inside the fog belt down there

852
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,200
and so you have a lot of issues with PM

853
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,440
down there powdery Milo for those that

854
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,878
don't know what PM is and um and we we

855
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,960
struggled with that I mean we struggled

856
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,559
with it for a little while and that's

857
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,960
that was the impetus for getting the ven

858
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:19,039
L um was you control that a lot better

859
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,320
um so you know the farm like all Farms

860
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:25,039
the first year or two we struggled um

861
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,440
then it got better um now Harbor Side

862
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:31,320
Farms you know is now St House State

863
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,960
House is a big company where several

864
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,919
different companies Harborside Urban

865
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,199
Leaf Sublime loud pack all came together

866
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,638
um and formed a bigger even bigger

867
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:46,519
Company by that time we had left Steve

868
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:50,119
and I and um and now all those brands

869
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:52,599
that are within loud pack or sublime or

870
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,919
I think dime bags another one they have

871
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,838
Harborside Farms produces all of that um

872
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,480
uh for those brands and then they put

873
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,838
those brands on the Shelf of their

874
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,320
stores now I think we have 15 stores

875
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:07,920
throughout the state now and that's what

876
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,280
Harbor Side Farms has become now um and

877
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,838
you know sh's not with us down there

878
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,839
anymore he's he he he definitely turned

879
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,719
things around I mean he was there for a

880
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:19,400
couple years and um and then he moved on

881
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:21,358
to other opportunities and yeah he's

882
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,400
doing some preservation work right now

883
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,559
with you know old school genetics and

884
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,720
yeah he I think he's out of place in his

885
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:32,119
career where he can have more autonomy

886
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,559
of what he wants to do

887
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,039
because he's very good at what he does

888
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,719
as a as a farmer and he gets paid very

889
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,960
well I can tell you that um so I think

890
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,358
he's done well and now he can do what he

891
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,599
wants you know um and good for him man I

892

00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:19,759
a volunteer job um and harbor side

906

doesn't pay me anymore um so um so

907
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,400
that's how I make a living and you know

908
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,838
I have a passion for building things I

909
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,559
love building yeah I noticed you've just

910
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,239
built something here right and it's

911
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,960
really fun to build things and then to

912
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,598
see them come to life and to see the

913
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,039
ideas and Visions leap off of paper into

914
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,680
reality yeah and then you know it's even

915
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,119
more fun when you're right and you're

916
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:47,279
like okay we plan that correctly we

917
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:52,559
don't have to redo anything um we can

918
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:55,280
just practice our craft right um so so

919
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,318
that's what I love to do I'm I'm I'm

920
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,040
mainly known for dispensary build outs

921
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,960
and Consulting for people to get

922
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:04,000
dispensaries but I like to be there was

923
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,000
close to the beginning when the

924
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,480
entrepreneur decides to either start up

925
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,318
a dispensary or fix the one they have

926
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,838
yeah I do both of those things um we've

927
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:16,920
consulted with grow and manufacturers

928
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:20,279
too I have a co-op model so I've got

929
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,559
folks like that in the co-op um I even

930
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,720
have Industrial Hemp um so I'm I I want

931
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:28,440
to build a lot of industrial hemp models

932
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,480
that transcend

933
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,358
cannaboids that are food and fiber um

934
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,119
based and hemp creete and things like

935
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,679
that I think there's a big future in

936
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,519
that huge yeah huge yeah I mean we're

937
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,480
going that direction yeah so it's it's

938
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:45,280
it's just an obvious direction to go and

939
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,800
I mean the cost benefit for one thing is

940
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,760
huge but also it's it's better for the

941
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,359
environment and you know obviously we

942
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,760
love cannabis and we love to plant yeah

943
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:56,719
so it's definitely better for the

944
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,839
environment and and you know that's kind

945
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,000
of a big deal right now um so I'm I'm

946
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,519
excited about that so so you know

947
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,880
entrepreneurs that want to get a hold of

948
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,838
me for help just reach out to Andrew

949
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,559

email to me and you know it's it's it's

952
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,639
a it's a real passion I have what I like

953
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,559
about Consulting is unlike harbor side

954
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,000
where I had to build just one thing

955
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,078
right you know I can build like you said

956
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,358
across the country and the world I got

957
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:33,519
clients in Europe too amazing so you

958
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:35,598
know it's it's it's no doubt a difficult

959
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,000
year okay for everybody including

960
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,000
Consultants but that's what I love about

961
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,679
it is that you know it gives me an

962
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,960
opportunity to take everything I've done

963
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,960
and just build the industry you know

964
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,760
throughout the country and throughout

965
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,119
the world it's enormously satisfying

966
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,680
when you work on something as a

967
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:57,760
consultant and the clients not only are

968
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:01,039
expectations met but expectations are

969
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,400
exceeded and that's when it feels really

970
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,519
good um because I go in and out of jobs

971
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,200
you know I I get hired for three months

972
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,039
six months maybe a year and then the

973
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:12,519
entrepreneurs run their own businesses

974
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:14,358
right that's what they love to do and

975
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,800
and so I'm having a real good time with

976
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:19,838
that and yes trying to build some things

977
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,200
in New York right now it's it's a really

978
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,480
difficult moment in New York they have

979
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,719
all kinds of litigation and Licensing

980
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,440
problems it's wild over there it's sad

981
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,239
to a degree yeah I mean the whole

982
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,880
dispensary model that they've set up

983
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:37,439
it's you know and they've got all these

984
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,119
um black market shops oh my God hundreds

985
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,599
of them um hundreds and hundreds of them

986
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,400
so which is much different than we you

987
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,838
know that we experienced in California

988
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,200
but well you saw that in La a bit um bit

989
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:56,078
a bit um uh and we you know I remember

990
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,000
dealing with measure Z clubs measure Z

991
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,880
is this

992
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,800
thing in Oakland where the police have

993
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,920
to treat cannabis as the lowest priority

994
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,440
yeah I was called measure Z and I don't

995
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,559
know it was almost 15 or 20 years ago

996
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,559
that got

997
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:12,639
passed and so all these measure Z

998
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,838
dispensaries opened yeah and it was hard

999
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,639
because they don't lab test their

1000
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,440
medicine they don't do anything with the

1001
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:21,000
packaging they you know and um it was

1002
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,358
hard to compete with them and I remember

1003
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,800
struggling with that a little bit um um

1004
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,920
so it's not as dramatic here in

1005
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,000
California

1006
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,599
outside of La really um as it has been

1007
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,480
in New York but New York's just one of

1008
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,720
these places if the city of New York

1009
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,639
does not like a vacuum it doesn't matter

1010
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:41,879
what the product is doesn't matter what

1011
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:43,719
it is if there's a vacuum and people can

1012
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,240
make money in New York on it they're

1013
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:49,799
going to fill it yeah and The Regulators

1014
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:53,000
just didn't even come close to

1015
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:57,280
understanding that Dynamic and now they

1016
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,519
have to enforce and maybe

1017
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,720
it'll be a little easier to enforce

1018
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,960
against a storefront than a delivery

1019
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:06,118
service or something like that's less

1020
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,039
centralized but it's still gonna be hard

1021
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:12,440
man because they go in they red tag it

1022
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:14,679
then they have to come back there's a

1023
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,280
hearing then you come back again it it

1024
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:18,519
you know there's like several steps

1025
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,560
before you can like shut it down right

1026
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:23,119
um and of course the owners of those

1027
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,599
shops are suing of course of course

1028
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,838
they're suing um they're like what do

1029
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,039
you mean you made it legal um

1030
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:31,599
uh

1031
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,199
so it's just such a mess in New York I

1032
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,400
thought I thought California was the

1033
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,519
poster child for how not to legalize

1034
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,160
weed but New York's definitely a run for

1035
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,880
the money we should have a flag you know

1036
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:44,118
you know New York and California right

1037
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,680
next to each other uh on the flag uh and

1038
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:49,640
you know it's it's easy to joke about it

1039
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:52,440
but these are human beings that are

1040
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,239
suffering um at the end of this you know

1041
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,159
on the on the on the on the tip of the

1042
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,399
spear is somebody who's ass is getting

1043
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:01,559
cut you know

1044
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,599
and it's

1045
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,519
just you know I work on public policy

1046
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,400
it's not something I like to do because

1047
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,480
I'm frustrated because nobody listens to

1048
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,240
us the elected officials the boards the

1049
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,679
they don't listen to us at all I mean I

1050
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:18,318
was in the who who is now the director

1051
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:20,919
of cannabis control in California I was

1052
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,440
in her office I don't know 10 years ago

1053
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,680
maybe or maybe maybe it a little more

1054
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,960
than that like 2018 right when we are to

1055
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:32,318
flip yeah and I whiteboard at her and I

1056
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,440
was like I put a big line in the middle

1057
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,119
of the Whiteboard and I wrote lab test

1058
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,280
on it and I was like and then I put an

1059
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,079
arrow pointing below that line and arrow

1060
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,920
pointing up below that line you don't

1061
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,960
need any

1062
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,480
regulation what do you need regulation

1063
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:52,039
for the lab's going to catch any nasties

1064
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,960
regulate the labs absolutely okay

1065
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:56,800
regulate the labs we've had a big

1066
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,079
problem with that because now uh you

1067
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,119
know the labs have been doing some you

1068
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,318
know Shady things with pumping up

1069
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,240
potency results and shopping their

1070
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:10,318
results around and and there's no

1071
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:14,078
consistency at all there's no protocols

1072
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:16,318
the labs don't have a specific um sop

1073
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,519
that they all have to follow you know

1074
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:22,920
right like if there's an outbreak of bad

1075
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:26,318
beef B beef if you tried to lab test

1076
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,960
every pound of ground beef that American

1077
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:31,639
consume go broke and you'd starve and

1078
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,679
you'd starve okay so they can't do that

1079
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:36,239
there's too much beef going through the

1080
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:39,078
pipeline you cannot spend a day or two

1081
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,558
or three lab testing all that beef so

1082
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,559
they unless they don't do anything

1083
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,200
unless there's an outbreak now once

1084
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,440
there's an outbreak then they then they

1085
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:51,279
do

1086
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,838
the uh the recall and they they have all

1087
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,559
the they know where the beef came from

1088
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:58,039
right they have that in the RS yeah and

1089
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,640
so they can trace it all the way back to

1090
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,800
the producer and then they lock down

1091
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:05,118
that producer and try to figure out the

1092
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,880
problem okay eoli or anything right and

1093
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,280
they recall all the product so nobody

1094
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,640
gets sick totally um you could do that

1095
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,359
with us yeah you could totally do that

1096
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:16,480
with us right um um I think maybe it

1097
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:19,598
takes a little while to get there okay

1098
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,280
because there's still it's still such a

1099
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:26,640
money grab right now that people will be

1100
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,760
not as honest right um uh but

1101
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:33,118
but if if if if she would have listened

1102
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,599
to me more yeah right the framework be

1103
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,519
would be much different right and you

1104
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,400
know and we would be able to compete and

1105
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,800
create one market instead of dual

1106
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,960
markets yeah right we almost have three

1107
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,119
markets now with the hemp derived uh and

1108
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,400
it's like how many

1109
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:56,160
markets can

1110
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:58,720
we have before our knees give up you

1111
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,679
know and it just Falls it just collapses

1112
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:04,239
right I mean so my vision is to get all

1113
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,639
this into one market the only way to do

1114
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,598
that is with good public policy and it's

1115
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,480
very hard to do after you've screwed it

1116
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,480
up like New York and California yeah

1117
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,880
right if California would have just

1118
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,719
licensed people that were already in the

1119
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,318
supply chain yeah and made it pretty

1120
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:25,239
easy for them and made the lab test more

1121
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:28,519
intense made the lab test the thing

1122
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:31,439
right that you had to work towards um we

1123
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:33,800
would have a lot closer to One Market it

1124
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,679
doesn't mean you wouldn't have quote

1125
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,680
unquote bad criminal elements growing up

1126
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:40,399
in the forest and selling it back east

1127
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:42,440
or whatever you probably would have that

1128
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,358
but law enforcement would be able to be

1129
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,200
focused on them right they wouldn't be

1130
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:47,480
worried about Swami they wouldn't be

1131
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:48,639
worried about and the same thing with

1132
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,800
The Regulators they would have been

1133
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,598
focused on the labs right um so and now

1134
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,960
we're working backwards now we have to

1135
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,160
fix it and it's hard to do because it

1136
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,800
you can't get consensus even from our

1137
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:06,199
own industry it's very fragmented um and

1138
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,720
so what I hope for California's and I I

1139
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:10,239
haven't been able to make this happen

1140
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:13,399
but I've been talking about it since

1141
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,679
2018 2019 I want I want a new ballot

1142
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,760
initiative yeah I want a new ballot

1143
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,039
initiative man um because if we would

1144
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,240
have had a new ballot initiative in 2020

1145
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:26,558
M when turnout was so high in that

1146
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:28,439
election we would have won we may want

1147
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,400
to wait till Gavin Newsome's out of

1148
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,639
office after this last debacle yeah

1149
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,240
probably yes yeah you're mentioning his

1150
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:38,719
Vos yes of the Psychedelic bill and the

1151
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,959
Cannabis Cafe Bill really sad you know

1152
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,639
really sad in my especially the the

1153
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,079
Cannabis Cafe psychedelics too I mean I

1154
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:48,759
think you know I like psychedelics I

1155
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,039
feel like they should be legal I feel

1156
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,839
like they do more good than they do bad

1157
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,519
yeah and the the cafes are gonna support

1158
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,679
small business so how can you go against

1159
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:59,480
something that would support small

1160
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,480
business and you know he was being a

1161
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,440
politician man you know he's probably

1162
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,119
running for higher office and yeah I

1163
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
think you're right maybe we wait till

1164
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,559
he's gone you always have to worry about

1165
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,640
some of them worse than him but you know

1166
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,200
it I'm with you I I feel very betrayed

1167
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:18,679
by Gavin Newsome um the Cannabis Cafe

1168
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,118
Bill the the reason he said cited for

1169
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:23,639
vetoing it didn't make any sense he said

1170
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,838
I'm worried about smoke in the workplace

1171
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:27,960
yeah are you kidding me man um

1172
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:30,920
everything's vaporized you know pretty

1173
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,639
much even daad bars are vapor okay and

1174
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,519
the only way any local person is going

1175
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,358
to let you do combustion is if you have

1176
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,519
a courtyard yeah right if you have a

1177
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:39,400
courtyard and people are doing

1178
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,280
combustion there's no threat and we know

1179
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,240
from science that secondhand cannabis

1180
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,960
smoke doesn't hurt anybody right okay so

1181
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:51,000
it was a lame excuse um it was a

1182
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,400
terrible decision because that will

1183
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,920
invigorate the entrepreneurial Spirit

1184
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,400
here in California we already have have

1185
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,358
all these chefs doing these infused

1186
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,760
dinners we already have these tour buses

1187
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,159
going around we already have yeah this

1188
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,680
Hospitality thing is emerging without

1189
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,279
any support from public policy you give

1190
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:12,679
us a Cannabis Cafe bill yeah right and

1191
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,880
we can sort of come out of the Shadows

1192
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:18,440
with that whole thing and you know

1193
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,079
California is about food okay it's about

1194
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,760
food it's about producing food it's

1195
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,920
about gourmet food it's about organic

1196
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,800
food it's about vegetables it's about

1197
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:31,838
all that and pairing food with cannabis

1198
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,960
is as ancient as Humanity I mean it it I

1199
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,759
think we ate cannabis as one of the very

1200
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,920
early things we ate you know seed right

1201
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:42,440
um um it's super nutritious I mean this

1202
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,920
is enough to feed a family for a long

1203
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,960
time right you know and cannabis and

1204
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,039
food have a great future in California

1205
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,760
the guy who ran that bills Hanley is his

1206
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:55,000
name he's a assembly person I think from

1207
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,280
San Francisco so he's going to take

1208
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,760
another run out at it MH they'll

1209
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,160
probably put some stuff in there to

1210
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:04,400
protect workers from smoke which you'll

1211
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,279
probably what you always worry about

1212
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,760
with these bills is they write it in

1213
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,160
such a way that no one can make money

1214
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,760
yeah right and so if you write the

1215
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,960
Cannabis Cafe bill in such a way that

1216
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,160
nobody can make money well No One's

1217
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,119
Gonna open a cafe exactly and then you

1218
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,759
know the people who don't want to see

1219
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:25,640
this happen we'll be very happy about

1220
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,640
that um um and you know they're all up

1221
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,879
there lobbying in Sacramento and who

1222
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:31,480
knows what the restaurant Lobby did who

1223
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,599
knows what the alcohol Lobby did who

1224
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,880
know so much stuff goes and happens

1225
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,079
behind closed doors that we don't ever

1226
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,318
hear about oh yeah almost it's just how

1227
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,680
a lot of it works anywhere but

1228
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,079
particularly in Sacramento I mean it is

1229
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,719
anywhere and everywhere but yeah

1230
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,839
particularly in Sacramento it's so

1231
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:52,039
corrupt it really is I mean you know our

1232
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:54,880
political system is pay to play

1233
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:57,079
unfortunately um uh and I I think a

1234
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,559
little that is probably inevitable in a

1235
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:02,880
democracy because money is speech to a

1236
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,720
certain degree but but it's out of

1237
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,720
control it's gone too far you know with

1238
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:11,279
with with handcuffing everybody in the

1239
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:14,239
supply chain all these entrepreneurs I

1240
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,599
mean there's some brilliant wonderful

1241
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:20,159
entrepreneurs you know in California um

1242
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,920
that are still trying to make all this

1243
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,879
work you know and a lot of us were

1244
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,079
looking at that Cannabis Cafe Bill and

1245
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,480
and we're like okay if this passes I'm

1246
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,880
back in right I'm back in I'm not going

1247
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,159
to be a consultant helping people

1248
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,880
outside of California build their thing

1249
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:39,639
I'm gonna come home and build my thing

1250
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,280
here right um isn't that what we want in

1251
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:44,598
California as Californians don't we

1252
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,079
want right now most of the industries

1253
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:48,838
owned by people don't even live in

1254
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,519
California yeah or the United States in

1255
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:54,960
some cases in some cases I mean I know I

1256
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,440
won't name names but I know of a big

1257
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,760
company in California one of the biggest

1258
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,838
their CEO commutes from the east coast

1259
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,599
to California yeah doesn't even live

1260
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:08,480
here and he's running he's the CEO when

1261
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,000
we owned an operated harv side I lived

1262
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,280
three blocks down the road from the shop

1263
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,079
I mean I I had to be able to get there

1264
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,280
like that the alarm goes off whatever I

1265
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:20,240
had to be able get there man and and you

1266
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,798
know my style of leading people is to

1267
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:26,679
embed with them yeah it's not like in an

1268
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:28,920
ivory Tower you know sending memo down

1269
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:31,558
um which unfortunately is what what

1270
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,559
we've seen a lot of um and I want I want

1271
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,559
the California industry to benefit

1272
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:37,519
Californians right um that's it it

1273
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,079
doesn't mean we're not going to have

1274
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:41,880
people from outside of California yes

1275
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:44,280
they're here and they're welcome and um

1276
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,358
but let's not throw the baby out with

1277
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,559
the bath water right okay and I hope

1278
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:52,039
that we can get a little bit better I

1279
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:55,640
mean to his credit Gavin Newsome did

1280
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:59,000
veto that packaging labeling build that

1281
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:00,759
was terrible right absolutely so that

1282
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,639
was one good thing and that was a big

1283
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,960
effort by the industry you probably

1284
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:06,199
signed the petition I signed the

1285
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,119
petition and you know that would have

1286
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:10,480
been a disaster okay because people like

1287
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:12,720
Swami would have had to Rebrand um

1288
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,639
totally you know Rebrand his faces on

1289
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:18,118
there you're not allowed to have a face

1290
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,759
um um in that bill so we got that done

1291
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:22,039
and you know like with all these things

1292
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,079
in California public policy you get like

1293
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:25,798
one quarter of a victory and two defeats

1294
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,880
yeah

1295
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:31,000
and then okay next year maybe we'll get

1296
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,838
another quarter and and you know you do

1297
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,838
the math after 10 years you get a little

1298
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:38,279
farther ahead but it takes 10 years

1299
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:41,119
we're five years into the program now

1300
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,960
yeah okay and Gavin news's big line when

1301
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,240
we passed it was it's going to take five

1302
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,599
years it's gonna take five years to work

1303
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:50,598
all this out well year five year five

1304
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:53,240
year five dude and you know what are you

1305
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:55,079
doing except vetoing bills that'll help

1306
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:57,479
other than the the the labeling bill

1307
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:00,160
which which you know again give credit

1308
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,318
where credit is due but right but you

1309
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,078
know and here in California you have a

1310
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:07,880
super majority right the Democratic

1311
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:11,280
party is the one to blame now I'm

1312
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,318
certainly not a republican um um but I'm

1313
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,440
not a Democrat either I'm registered as

1314
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:18,599
an independent um and what they've done

1315
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,480
I'm really really angry with the

1316
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:23,920
Democratic party here in California um

1317
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,559
because they've really really messed

1318
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,440
this up and continue you to and then you

1319
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,119
know spike the ball in the end zone

1320
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,720
publicly and say we're great and we're

1321
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:37,200
not great yeah you know so well I'm

1322
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:40,039
registered as a republican but I'm very

1323
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,759
moderate in My Views and you know my

1324
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:44,279
mother's the same way parents are the

1325
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,559
same way they live in Texas okay but uh

1326
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,359
I feel like I'm you a Democrat dude I'm

1327
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:51,680
more of an independent I would say I'm

1328
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,159
more of an independent than anything now

1329
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,279
with the times but it's really sad

1330
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:57,239
what's going on in the world where we

1331
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,280
used to just get along and now it's like

1332
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:02,000
well I'm a republican you're a Democrat

1333
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,798
and it's it's such a weird thing to me

1334
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,400
because I feel like there one party

1335
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:07,880
doesn't have all the answers it's it's

1336
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,760
not like that one person doesn't have

1337
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,960
all the answers you know we got to pick

1338
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,359
and choose what makes sense and and all

1339
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,318
these things are subjective to our

1340
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:18,639
experiences the whole debate about you

1341
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:19,838
know the biggest thing that drives me is

1342
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,480
abortions I don't even want to talk

1343
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,719
about that I feel like it was we we set

1344
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,039
this stuff up in the 70s we ended it

1345
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,199
there now we're bringing it back up and

1346
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,480
it it bothers me you know so that kind

1347
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,759
of stuff really bothers me about the

1348
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,199
Republican Party well I mean there's

1349
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,720
things that bother me about all all both

1350
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:40,719
parties of course I mean but one of the

1351
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:42,159
things I've I'm pretty good at is

1352
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:44,719
working with all kinds of different

1353
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:47,039
people I mean most of my clients are

1354
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,959
conservative Republicans right most all

1355
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,519
of them are um but we have a great time

1356
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,000
together and we build things together

1357
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,599
because we keep our eye on the prize

1358
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,719
right and the prize is is we're building

1359
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,559
a business together right um and you

1360
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:03,318
know and we're taking a lot of risk and

1361
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:07,760
we're spending money and you know those

1362
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:10,318
things are far more important than you

1363
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,359
know who I voted for who they voted for

1364
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:15,798
you know or you know what we might feel

1365
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:18,119
about some other issue that's not

1366
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:20,318
cannabis right um the thing about

1367
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,640
cannabis that I love is it brings all

1368
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:25,838
kinds of people together yeah um and you

1369
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:26,798
can be

1370
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,038
pretty

1371
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,920
conservative um and you can be pretty

1372
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:34,359
Progressive and those two people can

1373
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,960
share cannabis together and share a

1374
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:40,318
mission and values with their businesses

1375
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,318
together and do very well together you

1376
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,318
know and it used to be like that you

1377
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,960
know it it used to be rude to talk about

1378
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:49,038
politics at the dinner table it used to

1379
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,720
be rude to uh tell people who you voted

1380
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,880
for yeah those were things my parent

1381
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,239
when I was growing up you weren't

1382
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,119
supposed to share those things you never

1383
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,159
ask somebody who they Ved yeah you never

1384
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:00,200
it was considered very rude to do that

1385
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:04,838
well nowadays you don't even have to ask

1386
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:09,038
somebody you know um and with social

1387
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:14,558
media and everything um it's it's been

1388
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:17,039
Amplified right all this division um and

1389
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,400
tribalism and partisanship has really

1390
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,039
been Amplified I'm hoping that weed and

1391
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,559
psychedelics will get people off of that

1392
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:27,880
and sort of break that Loop um um

1393
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,440
because that's that's what did it for me

1394
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:33,079
you know that's what did it for me the

1395
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:35,000
reason I can get along with anybody is

1396
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:37,599
because I learned how to do that from

1397
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,039
these plants well you came up with a

1398
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,400
concept that I love uh C sober yeah and

1399
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:44,520
and that is just an amazing concept and

1400
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,039
you know you want to share a little bit

1401
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:47,798
about Callie sober with everybody

1402
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,079
because I think it's such a great thing

1403
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:54,159
well C sober is a term I did not coin

1404
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:57,400
but it is a lifestyle that I practice

1405
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:59,679
Yeah and it's we have an addiction

1406
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,440
crisis happening in in the country we

1407
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:05,480
have an opioid epidemic we have over

1408
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,480
100,000 people dying every year from

1409
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:11,159
opioids and other hard drugs and

1410
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,400
Fentanyl and all the rest of it so C

1411
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:17,000
sober is a version of sobriety that

1412
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,440
includes cannabis and psychedelics but

1413
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,599
does not generally does not

1414
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,400
include alcohol and hard drugs that's a

1415
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,079
very broad statement there some people

1416
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,280
who will call themselves C sober that

1417
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:32,280
like to drink half a glass of wine every

1418
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,200
night or once a week or something they

1419
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,480
it's not focused on alcohol right it's

1420
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:40,038
focused on cannabis and psychedelics um

1421
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:43,400
and that's how I've

1422
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:45,359
managed my relationship with

1423
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,599
psychoactive substances when you're in

1424
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:50,880
the underground or in this industry or

1425
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:53,240
you're a high-powered exec Silicon

1426
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,318
Valley a lot of those folks are addicted

1427
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:56,719
right and a lot of our community has

1428
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:59,279
issues with this because we

1429
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:01,838
self-medicate right because it's a it's

1430
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,039
a hard life it's a stressful life and um

1431
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:06,558
people self-medicate and I I I saw this

1432
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:09,559
all through my career you know

1433
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:13,160
and generally when when our community

1434
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:15,839
gets strung out people get busted yeah

1435
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:18,199
they go to prison they bring down other

1436
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,558
people with them or their businesses

1437
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:22,838
fail if if they don't get busted because

1438
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:26,519
they they spend all their money on drugs

1439
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:29,798
or alcohol or or they they just can't

1440
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:34,480
maintain right and um whereas Callie

1441
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:36,838
sober is is a lot of folks you go to AA

1442
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,760
right the 12 step program and and if you

1443
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:41,920
say that you take we to cope they they

1444
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,599
won't allow most AA groups will not

1445
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,280
allow you to continue in the group right

1446
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,519
and so a lot of people feel alienated by

1447
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,000
that you can smoke cigarettes cigarett

1448
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:54,000
weird part they're always copy and you

1449
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,920
know these These are also psychoactives

1450
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,639
um and there are circles of of sobriety

1451
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:04,358
support groups in the country now I know

1452
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:07,279
of one in it's called the I think it's

1453
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:10,038
called The Sober Stoner but she's out of

1454
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,839
Texas and she she gathers people that

1455
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:14,760
are in recovery and they smoke weed

1456
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:18,880
together and they talk about how to stay

1457
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:21,680
sober um and not indulge in the things

1458
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,440
that cause them a lot of problems in in

1459
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:28,038
their lives and and so I think it's sort

1460
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:31,400
of a um it's very controversial C sober

1461
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:34,520
because they why why is the word sober

1462
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:37,079
in there um because it it when I talked

1463
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:38,759
to David Crosby right before he died

1464
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:41,798
about six months before he died he's C

1465
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,400
sober yeah and he um said I don't like

1466
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:48,400
Cali sober why don't you just call it

1467
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:51,240
cie Stoner um and of course he felt that

1468
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,000
people that are really strung out there

1469
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:55,519
there a lot of them need to be sober

1470
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,039
sober for a little while while before

1471
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,480
they can reintroduce something like

1472
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:02,680
cannabis into their routine and I

1473
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,480
respected that Viewpoint you know I I

1474
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:08,960
respect that that viewpoint but I also

1475
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:11,519
know a lot of folks

1476
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,079
who take cannabis and psychedelics and

1477
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,599
it might be just micro doing

1478
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:20,039
psychedelics sure um and it helps them

1479
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:22,680
stay sober right and and so when I got

1480
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:25,280
turned on to this idea um I started to

1481
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:27,399
write about it in Forbes and a few other

1482
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,359
places and I start to talk about it and

1483
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:34,519
get people sort of conversing about this

1484
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:36,960
because AA and 12-step programs have a

1485
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:40,559
terrible not a very good track record I

1486
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:44,720
think it's something like 20 to 40%

1487
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:47,720
success rate yeah that's that's hard um

1488
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:52,358
and if we can increase the success rate

1489
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:55,118
from 40 to 80% because we create a

1490
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:57,719
methodology that includes cannabis and

1491
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,119
psychedelics while also keeping an eye

1492
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:01,279
to make sure that those folks don't

1493
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:04,480
start abusing cannabis and psychedelics

1494
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,440
right yeah um people can have cannabis

1495
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,400
use disorders people can have ketamine

1496
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,280
use disorders I've seen it all over the

1497
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,358
place right ketamine use disorders kind

1498
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,720
of growing right now because people it

1499
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:17,558
have access to it and ketamine is an

1500
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:20,199
easier compound to navigate you know

1501
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:23,519
than psilocybe and so and and and it

1502
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:26,279
does it's a pain reliever and it also

1503
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:28,920
you know gets your mind out of the

1504
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:33,039
default mode Network and into something

1505
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:35,280
that could be a little more positive and

1506
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,839
um but people get in trouble with it you

1507
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,079
know people get in trouble with it I

1508
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:43,078
know quite a few folks that have gotten

1509
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:45,280
in trouble with it and um and so C sober

1510
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:47,440
is is not something for everybody and

1511
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,640
it's and it works really great for a lot

1512
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:54,838
of people my brother me this is how we

1513
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,679
we we I we've made it work for our Liv

1514
01:01:54,838 --> 01:02:00,358
you know well it's a beautiful thing and

1515
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:02,679
I think my takeaway is that cannabis and

1516
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:05,880
psychedelics they tune you in whereas a

1517
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:08,159
lot of these other drugs tune you out so

1518
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,798
yep that's the beauty of it is you get

1519
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,598
tuned into the world and so when I think

1520
01:02:09,798 --> 01:02:14,358
of sober I think of being tuned into the

1521
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,200
world I feel like uh you might have to

1522
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:18,159
face some hard reality and some hard

1523
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,719
truths on psychedelics you know about

1524
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:22,239
yourself about other things and they'll

1525
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:23,639
bring things to light that can be scary

1526
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,479
and can be these other things but they

1527
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:28,000
tune you in whereas alcohol definitely

1528
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,079
numbs you you know and these other

1529
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,760
things they numb you from reality

1530
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:35,039
whereas cannabis in in my experience

1531
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,278
brings you back into reality well I I

1532
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:40,640
couldn't agree with you more you know

1533
01:02:37,278 --> 01:02:42,719
and um and so you know for people that

1534
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:45,759
might want to try Callie sober check it

1535
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:49,239
out read my articles and you know learn

1536
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,920
a little bit more about it yeah yeah you

1537
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:52,399
I'd seen some stuff on social media and

1538
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,838
I've read a bunch of stuff on it I had

1539
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,240
no idea you weren't the one but you've

1540
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:57,960
been a big advocate for it yeah I'm an

1541
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:01,679
advocate the term has been around for a

1542
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:05,639
little while now um uh and there's like

1543
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:07,118
all of these terminologies that we have

1544
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:09,679
and share with each other there's more

1545
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:13,240
than one origin story absolutely who

1546
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:16,879
coined the term but um but you've seen

1547
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:19,038
like Demi Levato and you've seen Willie

1548
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,400
Nelson and Billy strings wrote a song

1549
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,079
called C sober recently right so it's

1550
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,278
starting to sort of be talked about in

1551
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,079
pop culture and various different ways

1552
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:31,960

young man he can play yeah and I guess

1561
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,039

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,760

1565
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,798
see the young some of the people coming

1566
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:06,358
up these days I he reminds me of Jerry

1567
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:09,679
Garcia in a way because Garcia was very

1568
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:12,119
into Bluegrass and the banjo and stuff

1569
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,318
like that and fast picking all that

1570
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:17,680
stuff yeah that's right and Billy's good

1571
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:21,239
at that um so it it it it you know it's

1572
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:23,798
wonderful how the music just keeps going

1573
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:25,879
even when um from generation to

1574
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:28,920
generation

1575
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:31,079
and there's so many talented people in

1576
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:33,200
our country right now it's it's it's

1577
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:36,200
really remarkable so my prediction for

1578
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:38,480
dead and Company is that I I hope Bobby

1579
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:41,358
never retires but if he does I would

1580
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,159
love Billy strings to jump in there uh

1581
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:44,719
Billy strings and John Mayer you know

1582
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:47,118
John Mayer has grown on me quite a bit

1583
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:50,558
because I was very anti very anti- John

1584
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:52,119
Mayer in 20 18 yeah and I was like

1585
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:55,440
you've got to be kidding me this is

1586
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:58,000

uh all the nights when they played in

1612
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:50,759
San Francisco and took different friends

1613
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:52,480
every night and so yeah yeah and and and

1614
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,200
Billy I haven't seen Billy and the kids

1615
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,559
yet either Billy strings at Red Rocks I

1616
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,278
didn't get to go see it but I've seen

1617
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,798
the videos and you know they played so

1618
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:02,440
many roads which is one of my favorite

1619
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:04,679
songs yeah uh about Jerry and about

1620
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,159
addiction and you know I I totally

1621
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:09,199
relate to that song and you know hearing

1622
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:11,038
Billy strings it wasn't perfect but

1623
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,759
Jerry's playing wasn't perfect either it

1624
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:16,359
was just a beautiful thing but look man

1625
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,119
the mistakes are part of the sound you

1626
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:20,440
know when you are an

1627
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:22,440
improviser and that's almost the best

1628
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,318
part where it's not perfect and Flawless

1629
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,519
where it almost falls apart but right

1630
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,639
before you think it's going to fall

1631
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:29,880
apart Jerry would pull it back together

1632
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,798
somebody would pull it back together

1633
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,640
somebody would pull it back together or

1634
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:36,159
it would get yeah I've seen mayor do

1635
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:38,318
that too you know um and yeah I I agree

1636
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,480
with you at first I was like oh man um

1637
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:43,278
with John Mayor um but he's really

1638
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,400
vibing with the band though and him and

1639
01:06:43,278 --> 01:06:47,798
Bobby back and forth and you know and

1640
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,798
and everybody yeah and and well and I

1641
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:51,838
think he approached the community and

1642
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:54,239
the opportunity with a lot of respect

1643
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,838
and reverence I thought that was really

1644
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,000
smart of him he knew it was going to his

1645
01:06:56,838 --> 01:06:59,278
participation was he was going to get

1646
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,639
hated on for sure he was going to get

1647
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:03,880
hated on for sure but he still does he

1648
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:06,239
just he just kept being respectful and

1649
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,119
reverent of you know the Grateful Dead

1650
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,479
Legacy and um you know I was sad to hear

1651
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,920
that they're going to stop touring but

1652
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,880
I'm sure they'll play some special

1653
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,599
events well you heard about the the

1654
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,358
sphere in Vegas they're going to be

1655
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,960
playing the sphere and that's that's

1656
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,598
your prediction well I'm pretty sure

1657
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,679
that was an an announcement I'm not sure

1658
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:24,519
if they sold tickets for it yet but yeah

1659
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,879
oh that's that' be cool that'd be super

1660
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:29,038
cool yeah I mean yeah I just I love

1661
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,960
everything I love good music just in

1662
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:35,039
general so at the sphere would work

1663
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:37,639
pretty darn good yeah yeah I saw the

1664
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:41,160
$5,000 tickets but you know I don't know

1665
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:43,798
but I know I know I know the U2 shows

1666
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:46,519
looked pretty spectacular though yeah um

1667
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:48,759
so totally so I they spent like two

1668
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:51,838
billion dollars on that venue it's so

1669
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,160
wild yeah looks it's so futuristic I

1670
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,558
guess you'll get your money back

1671
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:58,239
eventually eventually but that's a lot

1672
01:07:55,559 --> 01:08:00,640
of concerts man yeah to get your money

1673
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,479
back next 20 years something like that I

1674
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,000
know something something something maybe

1675
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,079
maybe sooner I mean selling $5,000

1676
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,480
tickets you probably get them back a lot

1677
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:09,680
quicker yes indeed yes indeed with your

1678
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,719
career and all the things that you've

1679
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:15,318
done if you were to look back and talk

1680
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,559
to yourself yeah the the younger version

1681
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:19,759
of yourself uh that had just been in the

1682
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,960
industry for two years what is the one

1683
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,198
piece of advice that you would give

1684
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,119
yourself keep more of the money I made

1685
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:28,358
that seems to be reoccurring with with

1686
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:29,798
people that I asked but yeah we took

1687
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:32,199
pretty much all of our profits and we

1688
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:34,759
put it back into legalization and

1689
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:36,759
activism and you know we had a

1690
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:39,198
Industrial Hemp company in the N9 I mean

1691
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:42,399
all these different Ventures Ark viiew

1692
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:47,519
canaline all came from basically our own

1693
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:51,599
pocketbooks and um so yes I I I I not

1694
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:54,520
because I'm greedy but because money is

1695
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:58,199
a tool and when you don't have much of

1696
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:00,719
it it's hard to build amazing things

1697
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:04,358
right and it's hard to do amazing things

1698
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,719
it's hard to do epic things so um and

1699
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:08,000
you know me and my brother really love

1700
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,560
doing epic things and so there's been

1701
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:15,640
quite a few times where we had Vision or

1702
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:18,600
we had idea particularly since the prop

1703
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:22,239
64 happened yeah didn't have the money

1704
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:25,120
man um and couldn't really go get it um

1705
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:27,119
because there's just really very little

1706
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,559
money in the ecosystem of cannabis right

1707
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:31,960
now unless

1708
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:36,600
you're a big MSO or Ro it's really hard

1709
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:38,719
to get any kind of investors in um so

1710
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:42,400
it's just a very constrained environment

1711
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:45,319
to raise money in right now um and so

1712
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:50,358
you know if we had kept more of our

1713
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:52,520
own um uh then you know these Peaks and

1714
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:57,199
valleys would be a little easier to

1715
01:09:52,520 --> 01:10:00,800
navigate um and I think we we could and

1716
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:02,279
would and will uh just keep building

1717
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,719
just keep building the industry and

1718
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:07,719
building you know Steve's pivoted to

1719
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:10,960
psychedelics a little bit he's got RV

1720
01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:13,840
retreats in Jamaica and you know that's

1721
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,920
an amazing thing that he built you know

1722
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,920
and we want to build more stuff like

1723
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,960
that you know but we are resource

1724
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:24,399
constrained at the moment um like most

1725
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,840
people in the industry so um that's that

1726
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:29,319
that would be what I I would tell my

1727
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:33,440
younger self when you've been on this

1728
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:35,559
journey year 40 for me you've been on

1729
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:38,279
this journey all of us been on this

1730
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:41,440
journey a long time you sacrifice a lot

1731
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:44,880
right there's just a lot of sacrifices

1732
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:47,759
uh that one has to do um either to stay

1733
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,760
safe or to stay free or to take care of

1734
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,880
the people you love or take care of the

1735
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,560
plant and or get people out of prison

1736
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:58,880
these are all things that are super

1737
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:01,360
risky things to do um and require the

1738
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:05,840
only way you make epic things happen

1739
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:08,639
really is with sacrifice you know you

1740
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,159
built this facility here and you woke up

1741
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,320
every day and came in here and did it

1742
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:14,799
right that's a sacrifice it's G to pay

1743
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:17,238
off for you but it was a sacrifice right

1744
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,800
and you do you string enough of those

1745
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:23,319
projects together um and you know you

1746
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,560
realize you're carrying a lot of you've

1747
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:28,960
got big backpack of oh yeah you know

1748
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,239
sacrifices that you're carrying around

1749
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,039
and the

1750
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:36,279
sacrifices they don't cause me a whole

1751
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:39,600
lot of regret James you know

1752
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:40,719
um but when I look at the lives of

1753
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,480
people like me and my brother have been

1754
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,239
doing this so long or you know any of

1755
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:47,839
the

1756
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:50,039
Pioneers um everybody is worthy of

1757
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:54,079
abundance and everybody is worthy of

1758
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:57,880
respect and everybody is worthy of

1759
01:11:54,079 --> 01:12:00,198
participating in building this yeah so

1760
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:03,679
that I try to keep my eye on that as

1761
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:07,039
much as I can continue to create

1762
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:09,239
abundant models so that just like you're

1763
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:11,359
going to do here um so that we can take

1764
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:13,119
care of more people right more of our

1765
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:16,000
people more more more of our community

1766
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,920
and more of the world I mean we're on a

1767
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,719
mission to bring this plant medicine to

1768
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:24,119

1769
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:26,319

1770
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:29,238
15 Wars happening on the planet right

1771
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:33,319
now or something like that um and the

1772
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:35,959
planet itself is sort of dying under our

1773
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:39,559
feet under our watch under our watch

1774
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:43,520
yeah so you know a lot of healing needs

1775
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:45,520
to occur and everybody on this planet is

1776
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,800
going to have to make sacrifices like we

1777
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,280
had to make for many many years they

1778
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,800
might be different they may be in

1779
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:54,719
different spheres of society or or

1780
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:58,119
different areas of

1781
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:00,359
business or different areas of nonprofit

1782
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:03,439
work or whatever it is everybody's going

1783
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:06,039
to have to make some sacrifices yeah um

1784
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:08,839
you know my partner Samantha she lived

1785
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:10,760
on Maui for 10 years well bunch of

1786
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:15,039
people she knows and loves their houses

1787
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:18,560
burned down during the fires on Maui and

1788
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,840
you know huge sacrifices right huge

1789
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,719
sacrifices um and all those folks are

1790
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:26,199
having to scatter and rebuild and and

1791
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:29,239
figure it out these these plants these

1792
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:32,439
medicines can you know greatly help us

1793
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:34,479
with all of that and and and help us

1794
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:38,000
deal with these traumas that are

1795
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:39,718
probably somewhat inevitable given abut

1796
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,760
that eightball were behind on the

1797
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:46,039
climate um and not to mention you know

1798
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:49,079
political divisions in

1799
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:50,760
society uh um um so the plants are on

1800
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:52,719
the way that's the good news right we've

1801
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,199
been carrying the plants we've been you

1802
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,158
know plants down have feet they don't

1803
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:58,119
have hands they don't have mouths they

1804
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:01,079
can't talk about themselves so that's

1805
01:13:58,119 --> 01:14:03,840
our job right move it around grow it

1806
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:06,719
yeah um package it tell the story of it

1807
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:09,880
educate folks about it then eventually

1808
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,039
the plants do most of the work for us

1809
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,440
right you know it's been my experience

1810
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:17,039
most of the work for us yeah

1811
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:20,319
yeah yeah if if you listen to plant we

1812
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:22,479
show you the way if you listen right and

1813
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,719
that's not just true with plants but you

1814
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:26,439
know we kind of have a listening is

1815
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,560
super important just being a good

1816
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:30,799
listener I mean all you entrepreneurs

1817
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,639
out there you want to really be

1818
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:38,199
successful listen yeah become a good

1819
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:41,480
listener um it's Richard Branson talks a

1820
01:14:38,198 --> 01:14:44,519
lot about that uh other folks because

1821
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:46,119
it's how you get information and that's

1822
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,440
and information is how you make good

1823
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:52,279
decisions um and so being a good

1824
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:54,079
listener with plants and with people and

1825
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:56,599
with your teams and and with your

1826
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:59,600
investors and everybody else is is a

1827
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,679
critical skill right now yeah well you

1828
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,159
know there's a saying that uh money's

1829
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,600
value is in its use and not in its

1830
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:10,439
possession and I feel like you have

1831
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:12,400
lived that example extremely well and uh

1832
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,799
yeah that's a great saying yeah and I

1833
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:15,599
feel like there there's so many things

1834
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,639
that are tied into that too but

1835
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,360
everything's a tool um you know our

1836
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:23,639
bodies our voices are are you know money

1837
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:26,319
all these things are tools right for us

1838
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:28,560
money probably is the one we're most

1839
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,479
familiar with because when you have some

1840
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,280
it's easy to take it and you know do

1841
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:35,000
something with it um but um but all

1842
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:37,880
these other things are also tools you

1843
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,560
know and um and what we're

1844
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:44,560
trying you know peace and love man it

1845
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,600
comes down to peace and love and and

1846
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,239
those are the two things that the world

1847
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:51,079
needs the most I mean yeah you know well

1848
01:15:49,238 --> 01:15:52,879
they transcend language they transcend

1849
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:54,359
everything peace and love at the end of

1850
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:58,400
the day

1851
01:15:54,359 --> 01:16:00,880
yeah and all the religions and all the

1852
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:03,559
Traditions um talk about this this is

1853
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,319
not just a hippie dippy thing absolutely

1854
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,920
this is this is you know and peace

1855
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:09,399
doesn't mean a comfortable life I think

1856
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,239
a lot of people get that wrong peace

1857
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:13,839
doesn't always mean a comfortable life

1858
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:15,919
no living in peace but mental you know

1859
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:19,079
there is mental peace and mental Freedom

1860
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:21,480
that's important oh yeah there are yogis

1861
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:24,238
in India who possess nothing yeah and

1862
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:26,399
they have a very peaceful mind and a

1863
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:29,238
very peaceful life yeah you don't have

1864
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:34,238
to possess stuff right to be peaceful

1865
01:16:29,238 --> 01:16:35,718
it's all within us you know um not easy

1866
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:38,119
but comfort and peace are two different

1867
01:16:35,719 --> 01:16:39,319
things and I think struggle the

1868
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:41,559
struggles that we go through are what

1869
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:43,439
Define us and struggle is something that

1870
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,480
I think a lot of people steer away from

1871
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,719
and they're scared of when actually

1872
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:48,399
struggle is something you should learn

1873
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,399
to I do cold plunging too so now it's

1874
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:52,519
like I'm embracing the cold water I love

1875
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:55,158
that um and it's really the cold water

1876
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,520
has taught me a lot uh you know I read

1877
01:16:55,158 --> 01:16:57,920
about Wim Hoff for years and all these

1878
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,440
other things until you really do it you

1879
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,440
don't understand what the cold water can

1880
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,638
actually teach you but it teaches you to

1881
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:06,000
go head on into the water and you know

1882
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:08,239
not be afraid how long do you stay in

1883
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,719
there so so the funny thing is I built

1884
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:11,959
up I'm doing some of these 15 minute

1885
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:13,079
plunges now which is you know you read

1886
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,480
stuff and it's like well you only need

1887
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:16,000
three to five minutes and I was doing

1888
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,439
that for a long time and I've built it

1889
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,279
up uh I don't always feel good when I

1890
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:22,638
come out 15 minutes sometimes I do seven

1891
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:24,319
minutes sometimes I do 10 yeah but now

1892
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:26,359
that I these longer ones when I do seven

1893
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,319
it feels like it's not enough but I get

1894
01:17:26,359 --> 01:17:29,599
the

1895
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:31,238
same yeah I don't drink a lot of coffee

1896
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,920
typically sometimes before I do a show

1897
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:36,119
I'll you know drink some coffee to get

1898
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,279
all in the mood but uh it's funny

1899
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:39,238
because with the cold plunge I feel like

1900
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:42,519
I get that same experience I'm awake and

1901
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:44,879
I'm really present in reality and you I

1902
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,400
feel like my brain functions better yeah

1903
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,480
I've been doing I don't have the tub

1904
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,439
with the ice uh but I've been doing

1905
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:53,759
different types of cold plunges but I'm

1906
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:56,638
it's more like 60 seconds yeah so um

1907
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,000
I'll have to work my way up to even I

1908
01:17:56,639 --> 01:17:59,639
started out with a little bit longer

1909
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,520
than that but I think I started out with

1910
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:03,119
two the first time I did it was about a

1911
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,639
minute and then I did three minutes the

1912
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:06,920
next time and then what you realize is

1913
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,119
like these things that you think are

1914
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,000
going to kill you because right before

1915
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:11,599
you get in freezing cold water you think

1916
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,319
it's gonna kill you right your

1917
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,840
subconscious is like you're not doing

1918
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:18,198
this yeah and so over time and I I do it

1919
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,520
daily now and there's some arguments for

1920
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:21,638
how often you should do it and I feel

1921
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,520
like you just need to listen to your

1922
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:25,039
body and do what's right for you yeah

1923
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,920
and some days I feel like only going

1924
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:28,439
seven minutes and Someday I'm like I

1925
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,359
want to do 15 minutes and I do it on an

1926
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:32,079
empty stomach first thing I get out of

1927
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:34,679
bed and I go into the water it's got to

1928
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:37,439
be below 55 degrees is the ideal for

1929
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:38,880
like the cold chock proteins yeah and

1930
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:40,759
it's just it's a wonderful thing and I

1931
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,159
think everybody should try it and force

1932
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:45,360
Tony Robins method oh yeah yeah go

1933
01:18:43,158 --> 01:18:48,319
straight into the fire yeah no and

1934
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:50,158
decision making so you decide first

1935
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:52,960
thing to do something

1936
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,198
that's naturally uncomfortable for you

1937
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,639
totally and so all the other

1938
01:18:54,198 --> 01:18:58,279
uncomfortable things that happen

1939
01:18:55,639 --> 01:19:00,960
throughout the day become a lot easier

1940
01:18:58,279 --> 01:19:03,359
and you cuz our subconscious I'm dealing

1941
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,719
with this a lot right now our

1942
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:07,880
subconscious wants us to stay the same

1943
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:09,920
and be comfortable right it doesn't want

1944
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:11,679
us to really change a whole lot

1945
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,560
especially if you know you figured out

1946
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:16,480
how to be somewhat comfortable right

1947
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,360
your body and your subconscious like

1948
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:20,919
you're good man stay right here that's

1949
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:23,198
it Oh no you're G to try a cold punch no

1950
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,639
no don't do that you don't feel it you

1951
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,839
all these things come in your mind right

1952
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:31,119
and to and and your subconscious wants

1953
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:34,119
you to not do the plunge right right but

1954
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:36,559
so you have to have a lot of conscious

1955
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:39,079
effort right to to make that decision

1956
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:42,760
and do that I know that right before I

1957
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:47,079
do mine and I usually do it after my

1958
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:50,760
morning workout so um um I I stand on

1959
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:53,158
the edge of the water for a good 60 90

1960
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:56,400
seconds before I can make the decision

1961
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:59,319
right to go in there and it's it's like

1962
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,158
your body's it's just it's a trip what

1963
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:02,960
your subconscious mind does when you're

1964
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:04,920
like right there on the edge of the

1965
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,960
water yeah um do you do it for pain

1966
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,880
relief or you just do it for mental or

1967
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,480
well so I have Aller of colitis and it's

1968
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,639
in remission right now and one of the

1969
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,879
things I that put it in remission I

1970
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,679
believe is the cold plunges and so I was

1971
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,079
on biologics I was on this drug called

1972
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:20,840
Remicade and I got off completely off

1973
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:22,960
Remicade and I was doing cold plunges

1974
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:25,840
and then my doctor's like you think

1975
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,639
about going back on Remicade and I said

1976
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,279
well I I'm not having any problems right

1977
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:30,760
now so I'm just going to wait another

1978
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,119
month and another month turned into

1979
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,480
another month and it turned into another

1980
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:36,238
month and now I'm completely off and

1981
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:38,158
that's great there you know it's like

1982
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,279
yeah I changed my diet I don't drink

1983
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,158
beer if I drink alcohol it's going to be

1984
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:43,679
like a Gonic but I don't drink a lot

1985
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:47,039
yeah right and so that's the big thing

1986
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:49,039
is like noticeable changes in lifestyle

1987
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:51,198
with the cold plunge I think it makes

1988
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:55,359
you really aware of where you are in

1989
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:57,678
that moment and I I just I see a lot of

1990
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:59,679
uh guy you know Tony Robbins we've got

1991
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,199
David gogins right yeah one of their

1992
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,639
biggest things is they talking about

1993
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:04,759
doing stuff you don't feel comfortable

1994
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:05,920
with yeah and I mean those are you know

1995
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,320
we want to be comfortable our

1996
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,399
subconscious like you're saying really

1997
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:11,359
wants us to be comfortable and I think a

1998
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:12,719
lot of people try to Veer away from

1999
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:14,198
anything that's outside their comfort

2000
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:17,840
zone when really we should be going head

2001
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:19,638
on towards it yeah and and you know I

2002
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,400
found that getting help works with that

2003
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:26,440
a lot like for for example I hired a

2004
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:30,559
person trainer yeah um because now I'm

2005
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:32,119
in my 50s um and now that I'm going once

2006
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,520
a week to the trainer and he's giving me

2007
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:36,679
all these exercises to do on my own yeah

2008
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:40,440
you know I'm getting in pretty darn good

2009
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:44,000
physical shape yeah um and it feels

2010
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:46,479
really good um now I would not be as far

2011
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,039
along had I not hired the trainer

2012
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:51,279
because I learned exercises I didn't

2013
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:54,198
know before um and you know before that

2014
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:55,800
I would like lift a little weight I'd go

2015
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:57,039
on a stationary bike I'd go on a long

2016
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:00,239
hike but I

2017
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:02,479
wasn't pushing myself to the edge okay

2018
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,919
which the trainer does right um and the

2019
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:06,039
trainer also gives you a homework and if

2020
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,560
you don't do the homework you're going

2021
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:08,800
to be in a world of hurt he's gonna know

2022
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,239
it too it's real well you're going to be

2023
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,320
in a world of hurt he's going to put you

2024
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:12,839
through the workout and you're you're

2025
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:15,119
going to barely be able to finish it

2026
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,520
right um so you're incentivized to keep

2027
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,880
going because you have to answer to

2028
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,960
somebody right and I found and whether

2029
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:25,199
that's getting a coach like Tony Robbins

2030
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:27,960
or you know um other people really help

2031
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:31,000
us transcend these plateaus that we may

2032
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,800
find ourselves in life you know and and

2033
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,039
again you know it's it's it's not to

2034
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,159
shamelessly plug my Consulting business

2035
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:42,119
but that's what people like us do right

2036
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:44,399
is is is is we're here to help and um

2037
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:46,119
it's hard to reach out for help the ego

2038
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:48,039
and the subconscious ah you don't need

2039
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:50,920
any help you got this you're fine you

2040
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:52,158
know what you're doing yeah um but when

2041
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,399
you're talking about something that's

2042
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:58,039
complex act as starting a cannabis

2043
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:59,759
dispensary in New York yeah you know um

2044
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:02,119
I'm seeing a lot of folks in New York

2045
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,000
just making

2046
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:06,639
really page one mistakes you know

2047
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,520
whether it be what they're calling

2048
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:12,400
themselves whether it be um you know

2049
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,440
what kind of space they rent whether it

2050
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:17,119
be the deal they have with the landlord

2051
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:18,919
whether it be and all kinds of things

2052
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:20,559
you know I'm seeing well you're going to

2053
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,800
save people money and that's the big I

2054
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,400
think what people a lot of people don't

2055
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,239
understand is with Consultants they save

2056
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,519
you money A lot of times you can hire

2057
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:30,359
someone that can navigate that knows

2058
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,719
where you're going so you don't have to

2059
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,639
go all over the place you can go in a

2060
01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:36,158
straight line from where you are now to

2061
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:39,359
where you want to be that's the big and

2062
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:40,599
do it efficiently fast okay because and

2063
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:42,679
you have to do it fast these days you

2064
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:45,079
have to do it fast these days right um

2065
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:48,719
because every day that you're not

2066
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:51,238
bringing Revenue in yeah is a bad day

2067
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:53,119
yeah okay it is because you have to

2068
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,519
spend money every day

2069
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:58,119
to be a license holder in any framework

2070
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,920
you have to spend money every single day

2071
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:02,238
so there's thousands of dollars going

2072
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,119
out every day every day there's new

2073
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:07,039
competition coming online so that market

2074
01:24:04,119 --> 01:24:11,399
share gets smaller and smaller it's just

2075
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:12,639
so you have to be good okay and um and

2076
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:16,158
and

2077
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,480
yes Consultants especially some of us

2078
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:19,319
that have been doing this for a long

2079
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:23,079
time we're

2080
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:25,238
not cheap right the good ones cheap the

2081
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:27,399
good ones are not cheap no but but I

2082
01:24:25,238 --> 01:24:29,559
like I'm not super expensive so like you

2083
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:32,158
know I'm I I like to think of myself as

2084
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,639
the best but I generally fall in the

2085
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:36,839
middle of pricing in in the market you

2086
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:39,560
know I'm not way out here like some of

2087
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:43,800
the law firms and other people are but

2088
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:45,600
I'm not I'm not way down you know where

2089
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:49,279
someone who doesn't have the track

2090
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:52,000
record I do might price themselves right

2091
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:55,840
right um so you know and that middle

2092
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:59,600
place where I'm at it it it gives people

2093
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:01,840
excellence and expertise at at at a rate

2094
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,679
that will save them money yeah I'll give

2095
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:07,560
you an example in Ohio it's a medical

2096
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:09,239
framework there and they just issued a

2097
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:12,440
bunch of new licenses my clients got

2098
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:14,759
three of them and the State Board of

2099
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:17,198
Pharmacy runs the program in Ohio they

2100
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:20,000
require they only give you nine months

2101
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:23,879
from the time you're awarded the license

2102
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:26,840
to opening your doors for a dispensary

2103
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:29,520
wow that's very hard to do especially if

2104
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,279
the buildings that are available to you

2105
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,600
in

2106
01:25:30,279 --> 01:25:35,279
zoning are not very good buildings right

2107
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,600
so we had to take two of our three

2108
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:41,960
buildings down to the stud oh and then

2109
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:45,280
build it out from there um and we still

2110
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:49,198
because those clients hired me okay and

2111
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:52,559
my team we they opened on time okay

2112
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:54,960
something like 60 or 70% of the other

2113
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,880
license holders in Ohio did not open on

2114
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,960
time a good 20 or 30 of them are still

2115
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:03,319
not open all right and and I feel bad

2116
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,719
because like If you hired me I would

2117
01:26:03,319 --> 01:26:08,479
have had you open by now man and it's

2118
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:10,840
like you know and a month goes by that

2119
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:12,638
you're not open my God that's that could

2120
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:14,319
be a million dollars right there that

2121
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,600
you Lo that you didn't get in Revenue

2122
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,519
would have more than paid for your

2123
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:21,199
Consulting service many times over many

2124
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:24,800
times over and so you know these are the

2125
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:26,839
kind of things that happen um um for

2126
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,679
folks and and and I want to avoid that I

2127
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:33,079
want I want you to avoid being late I

2128
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:35,039
want you to avoid having to change

2129
01:26:33,079 --> 01:26:36,639
something that's built with concrete

2130
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:39,359
because you didn't plan it on paper

2131
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,079
right right how many people do you know

2132
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,399
that had to tear out stuff that they

2133
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:47,039
built because it wasn't done right the

2134
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:48,839
first time a lot of them a lot right and

2135
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:52,000
that's where you start to get in a world

2136
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,279
of pain um because I don't know tearing

2137
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,840
something something out rebuilding it

2138
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:58,960
that's a week yeah best case scenario a

2139
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:01,719
week um and so now you've got a domino

2140
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,960
effect because that piece of the

2141
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:05,880
building or the the the the you know

2142
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,880
isn't built and it's late and so there's

2143
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,679
a domino effect on everybody else that

2144
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:12,480
and cost is more than double because you

2145
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:15,679
have to tear out what tear out and and

2146
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:18,238
you feel really bad as an entrepreneur

2147
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:21,800
you just feel bad right um and we don't

2148
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:23,839
want to feel bad it's hard enough um so

2149
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:25,119
so but there is kind of a race to the

2150
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,840
bottom right now not just with

2151
01:27:25,118 --> 01:27:28,279
Consultants but with everything with

2152
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,000
seeds with everything genetics

2153
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:34,158
everything it's just a race to the

2154
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,960
bottom um and but this too shall pass

2155
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:38,198
that's I think all of this you know and

2156
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,840
you've been around long enough with

2157
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:42,079
industry so all this stuff it's like it

2158
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,360
goes in waves and it's a struggle now

2159
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:44,519
and it's going to get better and then

2160
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,880
it's probably going to be a struggle

2161
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,719
again and it's going to get better up

2162
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:50,600
and down up and down up and down I mean

2163
01:27:47,719 --> 01:27:53,560
you know it's kind of like life um so

2164
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,920
but it's more extreme than life right um

2165
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:59,520
with the ups and the downs and yes this

2166
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:02,840
moment to Shall Pass yeah um will there

2167
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:05,760
be a race to the bottom you know for the

2168
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:09,000
foreseeable future in the Cannabis

2169
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:11,199
industry probably you know um because

2170
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,960
the Frameworks are so screwed up with

2171
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:17,118
regulation and taxes that consumers are

2172
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:19,359
very price conscious you know and and

2173
01:28:17,118 --> 01:28:21,599
and all the heavy consumers are

2174
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:25,000
underground because they can't afford it

2175
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:27,280
yeah um and so this is the problem the

2176
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,639
the it it so of course people want to

2177
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:32,238
slash their

2178
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:36,719
prices to try to bring people in right

2179
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:38,638
and it can end badly right because even

2180
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,239
if your margins are the same or get

2181
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:44,480
better because your inputs are cheaper

2182
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:46,279
your cash flow is really much lower

2183
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:47,399
right you have lower cash flow than you

2184
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:49,158
did before because you're selling

2185
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:51,679
something for 20 an e instead of 40 and

2186
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:52,719
e um or whatever the number is right

2187
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:54,560
right and

2188
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,198
now but you have the same amount of

2189
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,840
employees yeah all right and so it

2190
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:01,599
become the race to the bottom becomes a

2191
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:04,560
cash flow issue and you can run out of

2192
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:07,000
cash right okay and running out of cash

2193
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,600
is the biggest disaster for any

2194
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,158
entrepreneur right because now you're in

2195
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,280
receivership or bankruptcy or whatever

2196
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:16,960
it is um and talk about painful you know

2197
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:21,439
and if you did a personal guarantee you

2198
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:23,399
