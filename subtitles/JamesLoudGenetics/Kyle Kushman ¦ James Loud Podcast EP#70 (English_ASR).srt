39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,478
cannabis cups yes you've uh been

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,560
advocate for

41
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,118
legalization you've really uh kind of

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,079
pushed the bounds as far as uh veganics

43
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,478
we can even talk veganics today I you

44
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,118
know I think veganics pushing

45
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,840
boundaries um and your Strawberry Cough

46
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,840
that that you've won multiple Awards

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,439
with has been legendary so my strawberry

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,520
cough is a little bit of a heavy

49
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:01,798
statement because as you and I both know

50
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:05,359
I did not create the strawberry cough um

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,680
but I was uh gifted it and uh happily

52
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,919
carried it with with with me to this

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,599
very day you elevated to the level it's

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,799
at now and your name is synonymous with

55
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,639
it so I feel like even though you didn't

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,200
breed it when I think of strawberry

57
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,518
coffe I think of Kyle kushman so well

58
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,679
you heard last night I went out to give

59
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,640
out an award and all of a sudden people

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,840
shouted strawberry so I went cough and

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,679
then I went when I say strawberry you

62
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,479
say and I did a couple of rounds of

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,120
strawberry and I was like wellow that

64
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,799
was fun that was completely impromptu so

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,879
you know it's it's uh it's sliding doors

66
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,040
brother yeah when I took my job at High

67
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,239
Times I had to quit growing weed I

68
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,759
couldn't handle the pressure of both and

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,080
so I started slinging packs again and my

70
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,399
dealer was in Bridgeport Connecticut so

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,080

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Brooklyn to Bridgeport Connecticut pick

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080

00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,359
literally in a Dixie cup you remember

97
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:44,639
those bathroom Little Dixie and it had

98
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,319
about 2 in of surface area of Leaf it

99
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,000
was the tiniest little pinky siiz clone

100
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:52,280
I said of course thank you I'll take it

101

and I and uh I said can you get me a bag

102
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,840
and so he went into his pantry and he

103
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,518
took a a lunch bag a new lunch bag fled

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,360
it open and gave it to me and I said

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,438
Thank you and I drove it 3 hours back to

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,760
New York

107
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,000
wow and I brought it in the apartment

108
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,280
brought it up into my apartment thinking

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm just going to throw it away you know

110
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,000
cuz I don't grow and I took it out of

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,759
the bag and as I took it out of the bag

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,040
I got a whiff of

113
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:18,159
strawberries wow and I did like a double

114
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,600
a triple a quadruple take and smelled

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
the I'm thinking to myself did this guy

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,080
pull something on me like I know I saw

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
him take that bag out of the closet it

118
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,680
was a new bag like this is not possible

119
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,239
this tiny little clone is giving me the

120
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,918
aroma of strawberry

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,960
yeah and uh I just I couldn't throw it

122
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,719
away so I gave it to my German friend

123
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,399
over in Manhattan I said you will grow

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,759
this and three years later it was the

125
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,799
most popular delivery weed in New York

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,199
City and then a few years later it

127
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,960
became uh The Strain strain name they

128
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,800
used in Children of Men wow really

129
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:56,519
cool yeah I love good origin stories and

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,600
you know it's like had you not gotten

131
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,599
the the plant at the time you got it who

132
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
knows it may may have gotten lost along

133
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,800
the wayside it may have never been

134
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,639
elevated to the point where it was

135
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,120
winning cups there's other things that

136
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,280
have gone Strawberry Cough times OG Kush

137
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,639
that's uh Bruce Banner right so I mean

138
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,799
there would be no Bruce Banner it's just

139
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,199
amazing how these genetics and these

140
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,600
these small points in time where we

141
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,319
interact with these things you know and

142
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,080
and recognizing that it was special

143
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,000
being able to elevate that to the status

144
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,599
it is today you know you know at that

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,399
time I'd already been growing for eight

146
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,000
or 10 years and had experience with we

147
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,918
didn't even call it turpine profiles

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,439
back then right it was just the nose the

149
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,879
nose nose remember the nose nose no NOS

150
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,680
absolutely and uh yeah it's it's that

151
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,159
sliding door thing man it's just like I

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,759
just very easily could have said you

153
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,120
know I'm not growing yeah I didn't smoke

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,240
it it's a cool name and chucked it in

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,918
the bin sure you know and it would have

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,400
made its way out somehow but it

157
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,839
certainly wouldn't have

158
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,519
become what but it did so I'm just

159
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,159
grateful I'm really grateful to be

160
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,399
associated with it I feel you there's

161
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,080
there's so many blessings that we've

162
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,719
been gifted along the way and it's like

163
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,120
with something like Strawberry Cough

164
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,520
genetic preservation wasn't what it is

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,079
today it was much harder to keep stuff

166
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,879
alive for the long run there's so many

167
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,478
things I've lost along the

168
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,478
Wayside so many great things that we had

169
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,000
so many great things that my friends had

170
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,879
where I had at one point and I gave it

171
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,120
to somebody to or I gave it to multiple

172
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,159
people to hold family members even where

173
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,439
it was like they're going to hold it

174
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,599
forever and it's not there anymore and

175
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,240
we've lost some amazing stuff or the

176
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,839
cops took it you know the cops took it

177
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,720
on a raid and that happened to so many

178
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,038
people you know and you just don't hear

179
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,800
those stories anymore so I told you

180
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:53,000
about my breus interruptus story you

181
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,240
know I've uh two times I had a uh one

182
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,639
time it was uh almost six or seven or

183
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,240
eight years and another time was four or

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,840
five years of a project taken away taken

185
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,199
out My Hands by a bust you know and uh

186
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,598
so yeah I mean uh the Strawberry Cough

187
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,038
to this day is my favorite St strain to

188
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,759
smoke I haven't found anything that is

189
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,560
as has the clarity of high that

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,400
literally I'm I'm you know I'm going to

191
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,160
get baked and I may have a brain fart

192
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,159
sure and I may forget what I'm saying

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,879
but that happens to people who don't

194
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,840
smoke pot too you know abely but other

195
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,240
than that it's um it's

196
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,239
extremely stimulating yeah

197
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,199
creatively and that means that if you

198
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,639
like to ride bikes you're going to ride

199
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,079
your bike a little farther if you like

200
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,759
to Mountain climb you're going to you're

201
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,198
going to get into that you know and but

202
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,879
it's different than blue dream because I

203
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,639
feel like blue dream is similar right

204
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,199
Blue Dream similar and there's several

205
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,439
other things that are similar but it's

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,680
different you know what I used to call

207
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,439
uh Blue Dream Strawberry Cough light

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,879
yeah cuz my wife when we first met she

209
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,279
couldn't handle Strawberry Cough it was

210
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,840
too strong yeah and she absolutely loved

211
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,878
blue dreams so I started calling Blue

212
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,679
Dream Strawberry Cough light I feel you

213
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,080
you know and blue dream what is that

214
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,918
that funny quote about Blue Dream you

215
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,800
know if if you if you say you hate Blue

216

about weed it's one of those and there's

224
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,560
truth to that you know there's so much

225
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,000
we I literally was in a parking lot in

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,519
um

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,320
Marin County and uh uh I was bringing

228
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,879
some Strawberry Cough to a friend Molly

229
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,640

literally as a gift she said check out

231
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,600
this new strain my friend created it's

232
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,159
called Blue Dream W do you know who the

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
creator of blue dream was the hay

234
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,879
Brothers the haze brothers so I don't

235
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,839

236
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,039
blue the

237
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,760
the the blue dream like the summer it

238
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:05,439
came out you know and and uh yeah that

239
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:08,879
you know who can argue with a strain

240
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,399
that is enlivening yeah that tastes good

241
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,439
that grows like a son of a [ __ ] yeah it

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,399
has the best structure the best as far

243
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,720
as

244
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,320
roots it has roots it has Ro what

245
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,278
Strawberry Cough doesn't have Strawberry

246
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,560
Cough has the uh structure above the

247
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:27,120
ground it's this wonderful chunky Haze

248
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,799
yeah uh but below the ground it's a

249
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
little bit finicky and blue dream has

250
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,958
the best root TPS out of anything I've

251
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,600
ever SM Ro root TPS are when you

252
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,159
basically pull the root ball up and you

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,920
give them a nice whiff get blue if you

254
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,600
yeah try blue dream and it it has a big

255
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,838
Ro like the root ball is Big right and

256
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,639
it's super vigorous this is a thing

257
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,760
there's tons of turs in the RO root

258
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,000
turps been a thing I don't I call them

259
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,200
root turps I don't know what else to

260
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,839
call them but yeah root turps are real

261
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
um you could yeah full I've never

262
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,720
sniffed my roots oh yeah you could

263
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,439
probably extract root turps I I would I

264
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,440
would guarantee that you could extract

265
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm going to go home and S some root TPS

266
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,279
right now yeah it's pretty wild um and

267
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:09,120
blue dream has that the blueberry is

268
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,278
super intense so that is hilar I truly

269
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
never heard of that that's you know what

270
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,879
else is a new thing a new tech a new

271
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,160
tech nothing is new right really I I

272
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,759
love the young kids think that their

273
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,120
favorite song is actually written by the

274
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,799
band that they like oh yeah when it was

275
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
written in the 60s or 70s by Frank sonra

276
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,159
or something or the Beatles you know

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
it's like you know that there's that new

278
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,039
tech see I can't keep a train of thought

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,240
that new that new tech where they uh you

280
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,719
go out in the field and you uh uh you

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,639
resin gland test things in in water yeah

282
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,079
yeah right yeah there's the resin dial I

283
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,519
thought that was now that's not that

284
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:46,120
that old people haven't been doing that

285
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,519
on camera for a long time right right

286
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,679
but they have been doing similar stuff

287
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:55,278
in the 90s I mean everything doesn't get

288
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,759
popularized nor ped along sure right A

289
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,639
lot of it was you know cuz we we talk

290
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,039
about cannabis you know there's AER Dam

291
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,360
University which I think does a great

292
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,000
job at what they do um as far as

293
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,360
education but I think this industry is a

294
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,720
a mentorship a prorip type industry you

295
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,440
know it was for the longest time it was

296
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,040
like the the best way to learn would be

297
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,920
to learn from somebody who is doing it

298
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,360
really well you could learn by trial and

299
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,519
error but it takes a really long time

300
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
but if you found somebody that would

301
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,399
take you under their wing they would

302
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,560
educate you and tell you everything that

303
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,958
they know to make you better yeah very

304
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,759
much like the culinary world I talk

305
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,359
about on my podcast but you know that

306
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,759
was the beauty of and that is the beauty

307
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,360
of the industry so if you're a good

308
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,439
person and somebody sees something that

309
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,800
they like or that they feel that you're

310
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,440
you're worthy then they teach you and

311
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,039
they educate you and show you all the

312
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,839
tricks but that stuff stayed very closed

313
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,078
doored right it wasn't shared with

314
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,160
everybody see and that's really kind of

315
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:54,319
um I'm kind of I've always been the

316
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,838
Antti antithesis of that now when I grew

317
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,879
uh gorilla style yeah I don't think I

318
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,600
knew another grower wow like not one

319
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,919
I was truly

320
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,278
underground um I'm trying to think like

321
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:10,838
okay like I did know a few other like

322
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,039
you would meet at a concert or you would

323
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,040
you would and and then they would be

324
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:16,599
like from another so but I did not

325
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:20,198
actually know any other Growers yeah

410
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:58,638
things for different reasons yeah and uh

411
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,559
I did it for myself yeah I did it for

412
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,839
myself and how how old were you when I

413
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,638
when this started I was probably let's

414
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,079
see I out processed out of the army at

415
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,919
21 I was 21 or 22 years old well maybe

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,799
I'm 58 now nice yeah it's been a while

419
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,519
yeah it's the the landscape has changed

420
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,919
drastically and the amount of knowledge

421
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,839
is it's pretty wild because even though

422
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,759
it is and it can be a mentorship type

423
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,800
thing you can watch podcasts like your

424
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,919
podcast and learn how to grow you can

425
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,599
watch YouTube and learn how to grow

426
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:41,159
right you can read magazines there's so

427
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,800
many different things it's great and the

428
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,000
knowledge is out there if you really

429
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,719
want to do it it's out there you can

430
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,240
just go do it you can go to grow shops

431
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,319
even if you live in Texas there's Grow

432
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,959
shops you know you know it's like Bob

433
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:54,639
Ross you remember the old Bob Ross show

434
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,599
abut right you know what Bob Ross uh

435
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,519
people uh say say sometimes I have

436
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,159
mannerisms like him but you know what

437
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,439
the the cool thing about I thought with

438
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:07,359
Bob Ross was he he had a special uh uh

439
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,079
characteristic and that was that he

440
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,879
could make every single person who

441
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:13,918
watched his show feel like if you wanted

442
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,039
to you could go down to Frank's crafts

443
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,120
pick up some supplies and come home and

444
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:21,078
do that right that's been my motivation

445
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,599
nice to make it feel like if you just

446
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,720
kind of listen a little bit watch go go

447
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,678
get yourself some equipment you can do

448
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,319
that yeah I think we need more

449
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,038
motivating people like that I mean I

450
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,000
think we have a lot of them yes

451
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,160
absolutely there's a lot of people

452
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,519
sharing stuff and there's a lot of good

453
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
podcasts you know your podcast is

454
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,798
excellent there's there's uh likewise

455
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,599
thank you thank you yeah first smoke of

456

cool you know and there's there's lots

460
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,120
of good podcasts so and I think it's so

461
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,880
much different than his throughout

462
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,439
history because I feel like now we're at

463
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
this point where we're really painting

464
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,519
a true picture of what the industry

465
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,000
looks like and what the people go

466
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,000
through and what the people have gone

467
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,960
through uh it's not just from the

468
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,079
perspective of a small group of people

469
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,440
now it's the perspective of thousands of

470
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,639
people it's hard to push history on

471
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,400
these young folks these days not

472
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,000
impossible it's not there's an open

473
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,400
there there are open minds yeah um but

474
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,759

science to do a simple study I mean

487
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,840
they've already done it with other

488
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,359
agricultural plants they can tell you

489
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,038
what the max brick level of an apple is

490
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,359
Apple can only have this sugar well why

491
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:07,599
can't science tell us what the max THC

492
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,639
Through Math math will tell you it has

493
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,839
to have so much other constituents right

494
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,240
cellules fiber blah BL blah blah blah

495
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,439
blah you know so how much of it could

496
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,640
possibly be THC just to support the THC

497
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,880
there's so many other things at play

498
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,720
well in cannaboids even discussion I

499
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
just I just want to stop bullshitting

500
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,159
people with the number with the

501
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
percentage not that we'll discuss

502
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,880
whether it matters so much but I'd like

503
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,798
it to be accurate yeah well I feel like

504
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,559
that's one thing that needs more

505
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,038
oversight there's most of it doesn't

506
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,119
need more oversight but the the testing

507
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,400
across the board needs to we're going

508
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,759
legalization right as far as

509
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,640
legalization is concerned testing needs

510
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:51,000
to go and have more oversight and more

511
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,000
consistency and I think as a whole

512
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,798
across the United States there should be

513
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,240
some consistency with testing so a

514
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,359
person goes and buys this flower here or

515
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,798
there or there or whatever state you're

516
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,399
in and they get consistent results so so

517
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,720
if you're going a product going for a

518
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,240
product and it's 23% THC you know what

519
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,400
you're getting to a degree with even

520
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,519
though it doesn't tell the whole picture

521
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,440
we both know that right it is relatable

522
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,679
it's not insignificant it's not

523
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,960
insignificant it's not the whole story

524
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,519
like you can it does relate to the

525
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,240
potency it does it does it's just not

526
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,279
the whole story we don't want I don't

527
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,000
want people thinking that you know it

528
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,440
doesn't have anything to do with how

529
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
high it's going to get you because it

530
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,880
does right but you can smoke some 12%

531
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,240
Malo right and it will get you uh to

532
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,080
where you don't want to talk to people

533
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,159
but that's a rarity if you were growing

534
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:43,319
out all kinds of crappy cultivars that

535
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,720
only came out at 12% the majority of

536
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,879
them are going to be crappy and not get

537
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,759
people high so it's a rarity so most of

538
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,200
the time the THC percentage does have

539
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,519
relevance that's all I'm saying we just

540
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,000
got to put it in its proper place we do

541
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,279
right we do I agree and and there just

542
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,480
needs to be more consistency and less

543
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,639
bullshitting right and is that the world

544
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,440
in general or not it is it especially a

545
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,159
Stoners man come on well but but now

546
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,558
there's so much motivation from these

547
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:18,240
testing labs to uh inflate the numbers

548
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:20,440
you know and for the you know it's like

549
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
the political revolving door you know

550
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,600
you got a testing uh company you're only

551
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,038
one you're you're the one and only when

552
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,719
it first starts so you could get a

553
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,480
relationship with the comp competitions

554
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,400
and then the relationships grow and

555
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,159
other ones come out and this we'll do it

556
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,600
cheaper right well as a manufacturer you

557
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,880
want the highest results possible and as

558
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,278
a Testing Lab you want to get the most

559
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,919
manufacturers possible using you so you

560
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:47,079
want the highest test results possible

561
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,759
so it just and it sucks that it's like

562
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:52,678
that do may maybe everything just needs

563
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,960
to be double verified double verified

564
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,798
testing at once is not enough you have

565
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,759
to go to a lab that's at least 100 miles

566
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,679
away from the other one two

567
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,400
certifications in some states you can

568
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,200
send whatever sample in you want in

569
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,559
other states they get to pick the sample

570
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,440
out of a larger Source right and so

571
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,079
there's no consistency across the board

572
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,600
and it's going to have to happen on a

573
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,319
federal level with Federal legalization

574
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,839
we'll get there we are I mean come on

575
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,960
we're moving forward we're not we're

576
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,639
making progress we're absolutely making

577
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,960
progress everything the only thing

578
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,720
that's maybe taken a back SE seat to

579
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,079
progress is the actual cannabis culture

580
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,960
itself right and I don't look I'm I

581
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:34,960
haven't given up I'm not a fatalist I

582
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
mean that's part of my mission here I

583
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,079
want to make sure people are still

584
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,159
smoking a joint 20 years from now not

585
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:44,199
not acting like it's an old fogy thing

586
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,840
you know if it's not in a pen who are

587
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:51,558
you Gramps you know but the culture the

588
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:55,399
culture that that reared me is important

589
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:59,440
to me I agree I mean I can't understate

590
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,798
it there you I I I I

591
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,759
from High

592
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:06,319
Times to being welcomed Into the Heart

593
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,640
of the Emerald

594
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,599
Triangle as a journalist you don't think

595
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,159
I got some threats while living up there

596
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:17,839
too right you know the whole the whole

597
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:21,120
thing it's um It's a Wonderful some

598
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,798
of nearly every good person I've met in

599
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,359
my life is somehow related to cannabis I

600
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:29,599
met my wife because I consented to teach

601
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,558
a the first Oaker Dam Unity class that

602
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,639
they taught out of state was in Michigan

603
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,200
MH and Dale called me up and she said I

604
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,480
can't offer you much money you know $250

605
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,440
honorarium but you know I'll fly you out

606
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,159
would you like to teach a class in

607
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,400
Detroit and that's where I met my wife

608
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,679
wow could have very easily said no to

609
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,200
that right so it's sliding doors man and

610
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,798
and all the doors that cannabis opened

611
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,440
for me are

612
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,558
just even the times I went to jail I

613
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,640
could you know I got a scar on my leg

614
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,599
from a motorcycle accident and if I

615
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,000
didn't have that motorcycle accident I

616
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,319
never would have met High Times yeah I

617
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,519
mean it just the the the place that I

618
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:10,519
moved after that is why I walked into

619
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,798
that head shop yeah and if I didn't have

620
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:14,918
that motorcycle accident I never would

621
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,679
have well and I think so many people are

622
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,400
afraid of making mistakes in life that's

623
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,880
one of the biggest my biggest takeaways

624
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,840
through this whole thing of existence

625
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,240
right is don't be afraid to make

626
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:28,000
mistakes don't look you know when you

627
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,519
fail failing is okay failing is a good

628
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,558
learning experience a lot of times you

629
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,158
can take it you can take the good out of

630
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:35,158
every situation and you know sometimes

631
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,640
the things where it's so

632
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,360
counterintuitive this this thing we call

633
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,679
life you're like you think it's one way

634
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,798
when you're younger and then you realize

635
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,759
a lot of that is the complete opposite

636
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,720
you know what's important in life you

637
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:51,000
know it's not it's not um don't be

638
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,720
afraid to fail because you you should be

639
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,319
afraid when you're taking risks but see

640
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,880
it's not all about accepting that

641
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:00,918
participation trophy yeah you know what

642
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,679
I'm saying sure and no risk no reward

643
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,440
yeah and um you got to want it you got

644
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,320
to want it you got want to do a high

645
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,798
level right at at the same time now

646
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:15,158
maybe not to start right but you got to

647
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:15,960
want something right and uh and then you

648
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,360
have

649
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,679
to you have to be pass dedication you

650
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,479
have to find focus and my problem has

651
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,159
always been Focus right it's why I don't

652
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,360
have big businesses and you know um you

653
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,080
know I'm a I'm a meager existence kind

654
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,599
of guy because all I really need is good

655
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,558
food

656
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:42,038
love contentment a little bit of

657
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,278
Serenity I a little bit of uh you know

658
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,798
you know I don't I don't need a mansion

659
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,359
I don't even want a mansion I don't want

660
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,158
a mansion that I have to guard with

661
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,439
guard dogs and cameras I just want

662
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,039
autonomy I want to be able to make my

663
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,919
own decisions yeah and so I guess I got

664
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:03,798
what wanted yeah well that's great it is

665
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,919
great I mean yeah and it's funny cuz as

666
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,759
you're when you're younger you you know

667
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,520
enough to make yourself dangerous you

668
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,919
know when you're you're as far as what

669
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,720
everything is concerned but as you get

670
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,159
older you start learning more about

671
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,159
things and by the time you're in your

672
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,080
40s you realize you've just scratched

673
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,480
the surface on most of it and you're

674
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,599
just starting to appreciate life I mean

675
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,120
I think and then as you get into your

676
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,158
50s I don't know yet because I'm not

677
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,199
there but I'm assuming you just get

678
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:33,200
smarter and smarter

679
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,759
I got married at 45 46 wow yeah no wait

680
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,240
wait wait I'm I'm going to be 58 I got

681
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,240
married at 4950 I got married at 4950

682
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,079
for the first time I'd been engaged a

683
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,200
couple times but

684
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:50,119
um yeah um you know I wouldn't go back

685
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,558
and do it all over me neither I mean you

686
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,479
always say if I knew what I knew now

687
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,440
yeah but you don't get to do that no

688
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,798
it's not there's there yeah it's not

689
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,519
part of the deal and so what I'm doing

690
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,839
is I'm kind of given props to the young

691
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:05,119
ones who are do have to do it now it's

692
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,879
it's a lot harder yeah it's a lot harder

693
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,158
everything is not you know it may be

694
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,120
easier because we have a lot more things

695
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,360
we can do by pushing a button yeah but

696
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:14,239
you don't learn anything by pushing a

697
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,839
button no the car starts it takes you

698
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,558
where you want to go nowadays you don't

699
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,398
you know you don't learn anything that

700
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:24,200
way and Me growing up everything I did I

701
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:25,599
was learning something everything I did

702
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,120
yeah the things that my parents told me

703
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,599
not to do that I went out and did

704
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,479
whether it was build a go-kart build a

705
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:33,278
raft or go in the lake when you weren't

706
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,519
supposed to you know everything I did

707
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,319
mhm was learning something yeah and um

708
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:43,558
what I'd like uh young people younger

709
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:47,960
than me to realize is that the

710
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:51,240
world the world is huge and life is

711
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,480
long yeah life is not people like to say

712
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,120
oh isn't the world small what a small

713
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,640
world you know that's one way to look at

714
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:01,319
it but see I got a different view yeah

715
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,840
I I think the appreciation goes the

716
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,359
other way like I think if every human

717
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,879
lived to be two 300 years old yeah I

718
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,639
think we'd have a lot less [ __ ] I I

719
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
would agree with that because see if you

720
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,159
know you're only going to be around for

721
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,558
60 70 years yeah you can be an [ __ ]

722
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,440
for 20 30 years and think you can just

723
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:19,038
keep running around and get away with it

724
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,720
they won't catch up to you but if you're

725
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,158
going to be around for 200 300 years

726
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,679
you're going to watch Whose toes you

727
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,919
step on yeah see so I'd rather look at

728
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,679
it like life is long and everything I do

729
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,278
is going to eventually come back on me

730
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,159
somehow see that's the difference

731
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,759
between the 40s and 50s because I'm in

732
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,559
this mindset that life is short and I

733
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,079
only have a I have a lot of stuff that I

734
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:45,359
want to do that's all true before I'm

735
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:50,359
gone that is all true yeah but

736
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:53,479
but I don't know it's like it's like um

737
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:56,439
I like I said the world is a big place

738
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,319
yeah it's not a small world it is so

739
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,278
huge it is I mean there are so many

740
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:04,678
places to visit there are so many so

741
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,038
many things to do kinds of people in the

742
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,399
sense that we like to say we're all the

743
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:13,640
same we are I get that is a truism it's

744
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:17,199
not you can't stretch that but beyond

745
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:20,320
that yeah if you can get out there are

746
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,319
so many shades of of colors in between I

747
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,398
always like to say I I like to I don't

748
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:27,319
want to close my eyes to anything and I

749
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:29,599
don't want to put headphones on because

750
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,278
I always want to be able to see the

751
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,000
colors in between the colors and I want

752
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,240
to hear the sounds in between the sounds

753
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,798
you know I don't ever want to block out

754
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,720
anything even though sometimes it's

755
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:42,079
annoying right you know well I want to

756
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,720
hear that Screech when it's coming

757
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,720
towards me so I can get the [ __ ] out of

758
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,120
the way and that's metaphorical as much

759
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,480
as it is literal you know what I'm

760
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,000
saying totally well and I like seeing

761
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,038
the bad weed as much as I like seeing

762
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,679
the good weed to be honest with you and

763
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,480
it's a funny why why do you like seeing

764
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,399
the bad weed so I like seeing the bad

765
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,079
weed because I like contrast and I feel

766
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,879
like you can appreciate the good stuff

767
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,720
if you can see so you want to see all

768
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,480
light without the dark there is none

769
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,120
right and so if I can see the worst

770
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,599
stuff right and a lot of ugly stuff

771
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:12,278
which I still like ugly weed right wait

772
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,959
a second wait how do you get away with

773
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:17,480
saying that I Oh you mean but it's it's

774
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,120
ugly but it SM good it smokes amazing

775
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,440
right there's plenty of stuff out there

776
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,879
saying I like shitty weed no no no I

777
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,759
don't do not like shitty weed I I I like

778
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,480
amazing weed but but the look isn't

779
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,558
always a qualifier for

780
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,558
does you know and I think you're the

781
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:33,720
same way it's like we're we're a little

782
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,278
bit older than than these new guys and

783
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,278
social media wasn't a thing and I think

784
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,038
that played a huge role into me

785
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,440
believing that and seeing the stuff that

786
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,519
I saw growing up it wasn't always the

787
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,840
good weed that I wanted to buy you know

788
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,278
the good looking weed you just made me

789
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,519
think you really refined a thought that

790
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:54,599
i' I've been singing few uh uh over the

791
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,960
years a good friend of mine DJ Short yes

792
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,599
you know famous for the blueberry and

793
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,440
and others which I can't remember yeah

794
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:03,599
the the flow right

795
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,798
um he once said to me and he said he

796
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:09,439
says this in public he says I breed for

797
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:13,798
only one characteristic do you know what

798
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:17,240
that is effect effect absolutely effect

799
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:19,720
and why do we use cannabis why do we use

800
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,159
cannabis because of how it makes us feel

801
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,480
exactly so if you can't isolate that

802
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,880
that's the most important factor above

803
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,639
the smell above now we just said you

804
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,039
know we're not going to smoke [ __ ] weed

805
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,759
okay but when I make weed and when I

806
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,519
decide to make a cross you know how many

807
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:38,038
times I've crossed strawberry cough and

808
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,038
the outcome was not better than the

809
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,398
strawberry cough and because it wasn't

810
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:44,200
better I threw it in the dumper and I've

811
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,719
never made anything better with the

812
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,038
Strawberry Cough to this day yeah and I

813
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,440
kind of feel like it's another Skittles

814
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,919
CU Skittles is the same thing there's a

815
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,038
lot of stuff that has Skittles in it but

816
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,639
is it better than Skittles that

817
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:58,200
subjective but like and there's like

818
00:31:55,638 --> 00:32:01,199
it's about the high yeah it's about and

819
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,200
we all got a bell you know and you know

820
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,319
that's that's exactly why most of these

821
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,080
hybrids just don't do anything for me

822
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:13,119
because the Breeders were not focused on

823
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,278
simply the effect it was second third

824
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,439
fourth fifth of all these things they

825
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,119
all have to come got to look good right

826
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,720
and that's the worst that's the worst

827
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,798
approach to all this right you know and

828
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,880
then oh it smokes good oh oh yeah it

829
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,519
gets no man it's got white ash you know

830
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:32,120
what I want to buy the tomato has the

831
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,839
funky veins the heirloom tomato BR last

832
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:36,119
three days in your house it's going to

833
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,398
go bad it's already started to split you

834
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:41,798
know those are that's what you mean by I

835
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:44,959
still like ugly weed 100% there you go

836
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:46,240
yeah and it's funny because what Dave

837
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,840
mesford I don't know if you ever met

838
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,000
Dave mesford he did canacon long hair he

839
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,759
just passed he just passed on 420 what

840
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,200
was his what was his uh nickname D Dave

841
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,638
damit Dave damit thank you yes you said

842
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,360
the last name Dave Dam there you go yeah

843
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:03,319
he was he was a character I liked him he

844
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:06,000
was a character but his like my last I

845
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:09,200
interviewed him a week before he passed

846
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,519
and it affected me so much because I

847
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,440
realized I've been breeding for flavor

848
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:17,159
the last five years really focused on

849
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,200
Flavor I'm a chef I love flavor it is

850
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,399
important but at the end of the day I

851
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,080
and in my justification for that because

852
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,558
before that it was all about effect

853
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,199
that's what first person that's what

854
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:28,759
their first assumption is that's what

855
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,319
their first impr and as a breeder you're

856
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,798
like oh this smells amazing oh it tastes

857
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,319
amazing but I was I lost sight of that a

858
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,519
little bit so now we've kind of

859
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,439
refocused over the last few months it's

860
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:39,919
like okay we need to really focus on

861
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,558
effect and how these things make you

862
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,399
feel because that's really the most

863
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,599
important thing at the end of the day

864
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:47,158
yes flavor is important yes the way it

865
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,359
looks important yes the yield is

866
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,679
important but like if we can just put a

867
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:54,638
little more focus on that effect uh and

868
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,120
that you know and that is the hardest

869
00:33:54,638 --> 00:34:00,079
because it's it's probably the most

870
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:03,558
subjective and it is to the indivual it

871
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,000
varies the most like you give people

872
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:07,319
strawberry C strawberry C they're G to

873
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,159
go oh yeah that's a berry I they're all

874
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,838
but if you ask them how it makes you

875
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,398
feel yeah it could you could get a

876
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,960
hundred different answers for sure so

877
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,279
you know that's that's why testing and

878
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,519
sharing it with so many people is so

879
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,280
important there there's no Baseline for

880
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:25,239
effect right right well there there is

881
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
uncertain effects for you there is for

882
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,719
me but that Baseline is going to be

883
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,720
different for me right

884
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,159
so you know what so you're breeding you

885
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,280
know I like to say when you're smoking

886
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:39,800
weed you're smoking the breeder right so

887
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,960
really what breeding should be about

888
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:47,079
this is what I like and this is why yeah

889
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,838
because this is my art yeah right it's a

890
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,399
representation of yourself right well it

891
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:55,799
all it all is and underlying all of it

892
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:59,000
there's a motivation yeah behind why you

893
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,440
chose to propagate that strain yeah

894
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,239
right and that reason should be because

895
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,920
it rang your [ __ ] Bell yeah totally

896
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,159
you know

897
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,000
absolutely yeah and DJ shortz always

898
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:12,519
said that it's all about effect he's

899
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,239
been preaching that for a long time I

900
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:18,199
think it's funny how many of us older

901
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:21,159
guys have experience with DJ Short and

902
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:24,960
he his words of advice you know he told

903
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:29,838
I was so hyped up about tissue

904
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,599
culture 12 13 1 14 years ago you know

905
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,679
when we first got these kits like I

906
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,200
remember hearing about it I like a

907
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:36,399
nobody's going to do that right well I

908
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,759
was like okay well I saw the potential

909
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,599
like this light bulb went off and I'm

910
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,200
like we can Bank all the genetics I want

911
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,519
to be breeding these amazing things and

912
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,759
I want to be able to save everything we

913
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,639
can clean this stuff and all you know

914
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,640
which isn't isn't true and it's not as

915
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:51,598
easy as you know I wanted to make it

916
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,318
Bill Graham he's the one who got me

917
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
excited about tissue culture I was like

918
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,599
okay this dude does tissue culture this

919
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,318
is exciting right and he sells these

920
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:02,318
home kits and all this other stuff well

921
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:05,599
I went to DJ Short and I was I sat down

922
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:07,239
to him next to him at a cup and I looked

923
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,838
over him and we're talking about tissue

924
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,919
I'm like tissue culture man it's the new

925
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:12,400
thing it's the wave and he's like

926
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,639
they've been doing tissue culture for

927
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,599
years of course and uh what they do is

928
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,799
they well his tissue culture he's like

929
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:21,800
yeah you take a cut and you take it in

930
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,000
the spring you put it out every year you

931
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,000
let it go get the vibration of the earth

932
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,358
you let it grow as fast as it possibly

933
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,400
can with the most vigor and then you

934
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:32,719
take a cutting and that is your tissue

935
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,240
culture exactly he [ __ ] on the whole

936
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,679
idea for me for tissue culture I was

937
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,959
like oh man he he ruined it in the

938
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,440
moment you know what it is it's a field

939
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,240
method of tissue culturing it and it's

940
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,559
very smart right it's very very you know

941
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,239
it's very you don't really need that

942
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:51,559
many seasons no the way I was uh uh

943
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:53,239
presented to it was um uh Dr Kenobi yeah

944
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,960
you know online you ever hear a guy Dr

945
00:36:53,239 --> 00:37:00,358
Kenobi yes uh and uh he used to uh

946
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,119
Garden up in Carpenteria mhm and uh he

947
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:03,239
stabled all of my legacy genetics for me

948
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,119
for a

949
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,598
while and um he told me that the way a

950
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,039
good way to do it is uh you know in the

951
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,519
summertime when you grow moms and they

952
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,960
all grow over six feet tall very easily

953
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,800
very quickly right and you got plants

954
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,599
that now are growing multiple inches a

955
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,400
day MH okay what you do is you just

956
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,680
simply you grow a plant F over six feet

957
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,639
tall is what he said you grow a plant

958
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:32,318
over six feet tall and then you take a

959
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:35,639
clone from the top of that

960
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:36,880
of right and that if you do that a

961
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:39,078
couple of times then you grow that

962
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,720
mother out put it out in the sun Let It

963
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:42,800
Grow to five six feet tall it's doing

964
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,399
two inches a day take the top off of

965
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,640
that by the time you do I don't know

966
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,559
whether they said two or three times by

967
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,559
the time you do that two or three times

968
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,960
you've cleaned the genetic pool yeah

969
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,559
because it it's growing so fast that it

970
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,440
doesn't have enough time to pass the

971
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,078
systemic pathogen or whatever

972
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,800
well if it's in the vascular and you're

973
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,760
able to get past that which is like kind

974
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,200
of where marem tissue culture is at

975
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,760
right like you're outgrowing these

976
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,960
things and I think you can outgrow a lot

977
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,119
of things I don't think you can outgrow

978
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,639
everything but you can outgrow a lot of

979
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,160
it and I think that they've been doing

980
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,759
that for 3040 years probably maybe maybe

981
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:19,358
longer and probably with other crops as

982
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,880
well absolutely absolutely which I you

983
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,559
know I just you know it you see it used

984
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,280
we we coined a term for it people

985
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,318
started calling it genetic drift yeah

986
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,960
there 's no such thing as genetic drift

987
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,920
what it actually is is it's more like

988
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,760
passing around STDs MH so in the early

989
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,960
days nobody had a good environment yeah

990
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,880
nobody in the in the winter time I'd

991
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,720
grow in in in the Attic yeah and and

992
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,400
there'd be no snow on my roof and in the

993
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,679
summertime I'd grow in the basement and

994
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,440
there was mold and dirt and dust and I'd

995
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,679
give clones to people and people would

996
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,559
grow in Barns and what you're doing is

997
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:58,239
you're passing around every pathogen

998
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:01,279
every anti- positive thing MH and then

999
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,959
you clone susceptible plants and those

1000
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,400
plants become more susceptible and

1001
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,679
that's not genetic drift you you know

1002
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:14,680
and another thing that I experienced

1003
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:16,318
recently is morphing yeah 10 years ago I

1004
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:18,358
wouldn't have believed that you can I

1005
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:22,119
can give my strawberry cough or my Grape

1006
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:24,598
Ape to somebody M and they grow it in a

1007
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:28,838
style that is

1008
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,519
so far from the way I Tre the plants y

1009
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:32,920
that in a few Generations I got the

1010
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:35,960
Strawberry Cough

1011
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,680
back I grew it out and it was strawberry

1012
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,159
like every butt I smoked whether it was

1013
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:43,358
this big or not yeah it was Strawberry

1014
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:45,598
Cough sure looked different but now it

1015
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,679
grew these long thin

1016
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,680
bugs it had morphed now and it also it

1017
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:53,799
didn't smell as good and it didn't have

1018
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,919
as much resin on it genetic drift no it

1019
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,079
wasn't genetic drift it was because she

1020
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,559
was growing with synthetic nutes she was

1021
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,440
growing under low lights she was cloning

1022
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:06,000
weak moms and that all added up to a

1023
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,480
morphing into a different plant but I

1024
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,719
think over time yeah and over time you

1025
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,079
look at so OG Kush that went the ghost

1026
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,199
OG and the Josh dog I had them labeled

1027
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,079
as these two things and I got them from

1028
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,639
two different people one came from up in

1029
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,119
Washington and the other came from my

1030
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,480
buddy in LA and you grow them side by

1031
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,960
side and they were different plants they

1032
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,800
look different plants right they you

1033
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,159
smoked them they were similar you could

1034
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,359
tell they were related but you probably

1035
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,559
say oh it's not the same Bud for sure

1036
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,279
especially the finished product was a

1037
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,960
little bit different one definitely

1038
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,720
yielded more with bigger Buds and one

1039
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,480
was

1040
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,000
smaller and so the they take these

1041
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,599
different paths in life and whether

1042
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
it's you know epigenetics or whatever

1043
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,519
you want to call it I would say that

1044
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,039
it's going through and you know all

1045
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,920
these things happen to this planet it's

1046
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:55,000
just like a person it's a living thing

1047
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,880
right so as it Go experiences that it

1048
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,159
goes through you're passing them along

1049
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,559
and nobody had ideal conditions and does

1050
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:03,960
tissue culture clean that completely I

1051
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,599
don't think so but I don't know but I

1052
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,119
but but I know that once um my stuff was

1053
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,680
passed along I I made an agreement with

1054
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,200
darkart Nursery yeah Bunch seasons ago

1055
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,118
and they were really really nice to take

1056
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,519
on a couple of my actual cultivars along

1057
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,200
with the strawberry cough and the Grape

1058
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:20,920
Ape which I carry but you know they're

1059
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:23,358
not mine and uh they put it all through

1060
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,680
their lab and they none of it had hop PL

1061
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,358
and virus and you know and uh and oh so

1062
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:31,039
this is what's

1063
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:34,838
funny so I gave them the Strawberry

1064
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,199
Cough that I got back from Mama Funk

1065
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,960
yeah she started a clone company that's

1066
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,159
why I gave it to her and and then I also

1067
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,760
and then I

1068
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,279
also see people people are like you

1069
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,240
don't have the Strawberry Cough we know

1070
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,000
you lost it I'm like I've given it to a

1071
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,439
hundred good friends you don't it's so

1072
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,559
easy to get back you know it's it's I

1073
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,920
make a call to my buddy to my German

1074
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,078
friend in New York and I have him mail

1075
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,240
it back to me like I know right I know

1076
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,240
I'm getting it back from the same

1077
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:06,598
[ __ ] guy I gave it to you know and uh

1078
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:09,679
and I gave them both to darkart yeah and

1079
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,240
they both tested the same but they grew

1080
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,318
differently yeah you know and so I

1081
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,279
chucked the one I got back from Mama

1082
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:20,000
Funk and I kept the one and I still give

1083
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,040
it out to this day and it's it's the big

1084
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,960
wide

1085
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,159
Leaf they don't even grow three or four

1086
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,240
feet tall but genetically it could be

1087
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,159
identical it should be identical mhm

1088
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,000
they were that's what they mean they

1089
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:34,799
were genetically identical yes yes but

1090
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,280
uh they gr the same yeah I mean systemic

1091
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,559
bacteria there's all these things in the

1092
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,440
plant as it grows and progresses through

1093
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,119
life and all these things happen to it

1094
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,720
you stress it out you beat it up or one

1095
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,800
person does and the other person doesn't

1096
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,318
or vice versa I mean well whether it's

1097
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,200
intentional or unintentional we've been

1098
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:51,558
bioengineering plants since we started

1099
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,118
Agriculture and people have seen

1100
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,000
pictures of the first corn plant it

1101
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,838
doesn't look anything like corn and that

1102
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,400
was nothing but plant selection mhm

1103
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,480
right so you can SEL what if we don't

1104
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,358
select like you said right what if we

1105
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,159
what if we don't select so there's all

1106
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,598
kinds of thing representations out out

1107
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,159
there that are accidental yeah some of

1108
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,359
them as in Strawberry Cough turns out to

1109
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,598
be great there's a lot of accidental

1110
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,598
stuff out there that some people take

1111
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,760
credit for whatever but even even bag

1112
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:20,680
seeds lots of bag seeds out there and

1113
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,359
some of the be best stuff that's come

1114
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:26,480
down we're talking bag seeds the old uh

1115
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:29,000
Grateful Dead story about the uh the

1116
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,199
kevin1 Kem came from Good Old chem

1117
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,960
father yeah speaking of chem I got that

1118
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:38,199
Sour Diesel I met up with this guy Dave

1119
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,838
Bruto and I so I sometimes think maybe

1120
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,399
my mind's playing tricks on me like I

1121
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,719
remember it different than how it really

1122
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,200
was of course Sour Diesel was like that

1123
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,399
right so I've seen all these samples

1124
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:49,199
over the last year because I talk about

1125
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,880
on my podcast so much so every time I go

1126
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,838
to an event someone has a bag of Sour

1127
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,880
Diesel you had AJ on right what's that

1128
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:58,000
you had AJ on yet you've never had AJ I

1129
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,440
have not yet had AJ we will get AJ

1130
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,519
moniker you know what AJ stands for

1131
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,838
right [ __ ] Joe okay

1132
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,280
absolutely U yeah we need to get AJ on

1133
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,558
it for sure and so I'd seen a bunch of

1134
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,920
samples of sour and they were all real

1135
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,480
gassy and they didn't have what I

1136
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,280
consider sour so in my NOS I'm in my

1137
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,719
mind I'm going something's going on here

1138
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,319
maybe it's my mind that's playing tricks

1139
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,558
on me this is this is sour cuz it was it

1140
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:25,838
looked like

1141
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:28,319
sour it smelled sourish with a really

1142
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:31,960
heavy chemi smell but it didn't have

1143
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:34,519
that that that Citrus that the FR behind

1144
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,720
the pine the fruit behind the pine and

1145
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:36,960
you you know you didn't even have to

1146
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:38,199
squeeze nugs you'd open the bag and it

1147
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,400
would punch you in the face so this guy

1148
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,759
Dave comes up to me he's really got it

1149
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,200
and we're talking about doing a drop in

1150
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,559
metric with it um because he has 10

1151
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:47,239
pounds of it and it's so good I just

1152
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:48,839
want to share it with the world if I

1153
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:51,399
could just buy the 10 pounds and give

1154
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:52,799
them out to everybody I would right but

1155
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,760
I feel like that's something we could do

1156
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,359
a metric drop with and I stand behind

1157
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,440
his flower it's it's just amazing and to

1158
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:02,358
see it again it remind now I'm like okay

1159
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,480
cat piss is the real I remember cat piss

1160
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:07,279
too and I've seen a whole bunch of that

1161
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,440
but that sour special so and I think

1162
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,079
there's so many things that I haven't

1163
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,679
seen in years but they're locked into

1164
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,160
your your brain into your pallet and as

1165
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,879
you were talking about flavors and all

1166
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:19,159
those important things I started

1167
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,599
thinking about the whole uh

1168
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:24,279
controversial ISS issue about uh uh

1169
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:26,480
synthetic fertilizers and I was like you

1170
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,160
want you you want to make people mad oh

1171
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,838
yeah absolutely I do I just want to get

1172
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,558
information out there this true I think

1173
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:34,440
that's the the truth is important you

1174
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,720
know unfortunately we do live in a world

1175
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,880
where truth is subjective sure and

1176
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,439
people get hurt feelings quite often and

1177
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,960
I think but that's okay I think we need

1178
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,559
to not be afraid truth is subjective

1179
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,679
there are no undeniable truths anymore

1180
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:53,319
yeah you know I'm I'm joking look we um

1181
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,838
I have an innate sense I grew up in the

1182
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:57,639
country yeah I grew up with a vegetable

1183
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:01,199
garden yeah

1184
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:03,480
and uh we didn't use Miracle Grow what

1185
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,078
do you guys use it was just natural

1186
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,960
amendments and then you just watered it

1187
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,640
you didn't need a lot of food it got it

1188
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,838
from the earth you didn't need to do

1189
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,719
nothing we had fertile soil yeah you

1190
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:14,400
didn't add very much to it you just

1191
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,519
tilled it over every year and you

1192
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,358
planted and the [ __ ] grew and it was

1193
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:23,559
organic yeah you know and uh you know I

1194
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:27,039
you know what I think it has something

1195
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:29,280
to do with the skepticism over the C

1196
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,159
ification of organic I know that has

1197
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,559
something to do because people are so

1198
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:36,639
skeptical these days you know I have to

1199
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,680
analyze all information before I make my

1200
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,480
decision yeah well that's because you

1201
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,679
don't understand understand that there

1202
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,079
are undeniable truths see you they don't

1203
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,000
exist anymore M it's all muddied it's

1204
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,400
all mudded it's all mudded it's all

1205
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,719
intentional and unintentional you know

1206
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,400
the conspiracy industrial complex is

1207
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,118
just as evil as the military industrial

1208
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,680
complex and the pharmaceutical

1209
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:05,119
industrial complex they all

1210
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,838
pray on the impressionable and the weak

1211
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,720
and you know they pray on us all well

1212
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,519
and social media has made it very easy

1213
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,039
to do so right absolutely it's no excuse

1214
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,480
though it's no excuse that's right no

1215
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:16,838
excuse yeah there's no excuse for this

1216
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,358
but yeah we live in a very strange time

1217
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:21,199
to say the least you know you know food

1218
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:24,440
you

1219
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,239
know you'll get people to agree with you

1220
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,119
that when you read a food label right if

1221
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,679
it has work that you can't pronounce on

1222
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,559
it you don't need to know what they are

1223
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,118
but you Pro like that's not good for you

1224
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,720
you probably don't want to be consuming

1225
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,358
so how come you can live with the fact

1226
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,039
that you're okay with feeding your

1227
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:43,000
plants which you're going to put in your

1228
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:44,480
body and you read the label and it has

1229
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,800
those same words that you can't

1230
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,400
pronounce and you don't know what they

1231
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:54,039
are so get the [ __ ] out of here you know

1232
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,318
now look I'm not taking away your right

1233
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:58,440
to do whatever the [ __ ] you want to sell

1234
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:03,119
what it to grow whatever I don't [ __ ]

1235
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:07,200
care yeah but don't debate me that those

1236
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:09,358
chemicals equate to the lack of them to

1237
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,799
the to the absence of them so that's all

1238
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,960
you know it doesn't have to be veganic

1239
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,680
well no your name is synonymous with

1240
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,159
veganic when I just as much as

1241
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,399
Strawberry Cough if I hear the word

1242
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:22,118
veganic I pioneered Canabis you know

1243
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,440
what and you know what

1244
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:27,640
look as much as money is not my

1245
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,280
motivation yeah I do things for self M

1246
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:32,598
and you know what I thought when I

1247
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,480
stumbled on veganics because I had some

1248
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:38,440
friends that were total crunchy hippies

1249
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,119
yeah and he was a vegan and he grew

1250
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,519
veganic and he comes to my house one day

1251
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:45,920
and he says man you know uh Canada just

1252
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:49,559
came out with this veganic soil and they

1253
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,000
had this biota plus it was only

1254
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,798
available for a couple of years because

1255
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,920
it had three different types of bark

1256
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:57,759
three different types of swagnum and

1257
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,680
each one of those six components were

1258
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,920
milled to five different consistencies

1259
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:04,399
so it was its own irration you could

1260
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,280
never comp and then one of those

1261
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,039
materials became illegal to import into

1262
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,440
the United States so they stopped

1263
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:13,679
selling it so anyways long story short

1264
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,960
um uh I tried it and at the time I was

1265
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,919
using Canon nutrients yeah which are

1266
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,639
veganic there's no animal byproducts

1267
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:24,119
there's no animal products and it's also

1268
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:25,679
organic and so um that very first crop

1269
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:28,480
that I that didn't have that wasn't

1270
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,118
loaded with uh B and bird guano and EM

1271
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,719
fish fish Emulsion and you know all the

1272
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,599
good stuff well balanced yeah was the

1273
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:38,480
cleanest weed that I'd ever smoked in my

1274
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,240
life and what I didn't know was it's all

1275
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,358
about heavy metal content yeah that

1276
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:47,399
makes sense and that's what I learned um

1277
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:50,400
when I actually created Vega Matrix and

1278
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,119
I sent in our first lab sample of the

1279
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,559
first weed that well it wasn't the first

1280
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,280
weed I grew with but it was the one to

1281
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:56,760
get the shts that we were going to

1282
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,880
publish for the nutrients and everything

1283
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:03,359
mhm and we sent the weed into a lab uh

1284
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,920
to do metal heavy metal testing and uh

1285
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,838
guy called me up and he's like Kyle

1286
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,838
you're not going to believe this the

1287
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:13,199
tests came back zeros in everything and

1288
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:16,199
right away I went there's no such thing

1289
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,279
as Zero's you're right he said we had to

1290
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:21,679
recalibrate the machine from parts per

1291
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,480
million to parts per billion and your

1292
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:27,199
stuff comes in at 2 to 600 parts per

1293
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,719
billion of arsenic cadmium Mercury and

1294
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:34,118
Lead that's a thousand times less than

1295
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:37,719
any PPM rating even if it's .1 or 01 or

1296
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:39,280
0. something parts per million which is

1297
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:41,598
all organic weed is in the parts per

1298
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,040
million the best weed still tests and

1299
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,280
that's perfectly

1300
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:50,039
legal but I found a way to grow weed

1301
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:54,839
that produced produce that had only

1302
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:57,519
Parts in perceptible amounts yeah and

1303
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:59,920
that was I wanted to share that that and

1304
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,519
one day I had a friend at my house um

1305
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,639
Billy Blackburn he created the easy

1306
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,519
clone machine yeah and they were on

1307
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:06,798
their way down to a show and he stopped

1308
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,480
at my house with his whole crew and he

1309
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:10,880
said man I'm so [ __ ] stoned man your

1310
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,838
wheat is so good you should make your

1311
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,480
own

1312
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:18,920
nutrients and it it clicked and I was

1313
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,760
like I and I was like I need to share

1314
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:24,760
this and I found a way to do it and that

1315
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,559
was my motivation was to put something

1316
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:31,079
in a bottle that was

1317
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:33,160
clean you know and I got all wrapped up

1318
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:34,960
in people thinking I think it's the best

1319
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,598
and I'm better than everybody and I got

1320
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,960
pigeon hold into this [ __ ] thing and

1321
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:43,519
I'm glad to be free of it and now I grow

1322
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:46,079
with minimal animal byproducts y um I

1323
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:48,480
use a really amazing n so I had to find

1324
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,079
a new nutrient my my my nutrient company

1325
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:55,280
went under about three years ago after

1326
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:57,240
eight years of solid business wow and uh

1327
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,240
so I had to find a new nutrient

1328
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:03,439
and I I pretty much used them all yeah I

1329
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,959
mean except for the newest versions of

1330
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,039
companies that have already been out and

1331
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,480
most of those are actually better than

1332
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:12,440
they used to be you know today's salts

1333
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,240
are not what salts used to be and the

1334
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,000
heavy metals are much lower and they're

1335
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:21,639
produced at a much higher quality um and

1336
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:26,880
uh so I use Organics Alive Now nice and

1337
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:29,279
this is truly a new tech in that when he

1338
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,559
designed it he had to create he had to

1339
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,000
do the white papers and create a new

1340
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:36,119
category of fertilizers before the

1341
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,159
California Department of Agriculture

1342
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:41,119
would license it and allow him to sell

1343
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:44,719
it as a fertilizer wow and that category

1344
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:47,240
is microbial fermentation

1345
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,480
byproduct and if you look at the derived

1346
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:52,719
from that's the only

1347
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:55,559
ingredient microbial fermentation

1348
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:57,759
byproduct I can't simplify that for you

1349
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:01,640
yeah but I will tell you that it

1350
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,319
contains zero salts and zero heavy

1351
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:07,558
metals so I went from low salts and low

1352
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:10,639
heavy metals to zero salts and zero

1353
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:13,760
heavy metals nice I'm pretty happy with

1354
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:16,440
it yeah the flower is really good the

1355
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,440
effect is amazing thank you so and it's

1356
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,760
funny because sunflower gets you tight

1357
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,480
behind the eyes where it feels like

1358
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,680
you're pulling your face others where

1359
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,000
it's like narcotic and then you have the

1360
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,798
stimulants the that lean on the sativa

1361
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,559
side the super silver hazes you know

1362
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:32,119
that have the Colombian in them or what

1363
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,119
whatever it is you know these stimulant

1364
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:38,838
or African stimulants and this is like

1365
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:41,240
uh feel good weed I feel good inputs

1366
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:43,759
determine outputs y it's the same thing

1367
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:45,919
with our bodies M you know how great you

1368
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,680
feel if you eat really good for a week

1369
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,760
or so yeah and you know how bad you feel

1370
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:55,798
it's the same thing for your plants man

1371
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:57,839
and that effect is because it's clean

1372
00:53:55,798 --> 00:54:00,519
right and and sometimes people say you

1373
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:03,318
know they get flavors off of strains

1374
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:06,559
that they never had um

1375
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:09,239
because the heavy metals now don't they

1376
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,559
mask Tarpin and they raise the

1377
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:15,598
combustion temperature of the weed so as

1378
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,680
my cherry cools and it wants to

1379
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,119
extinguish the higher the heavy metal

1380
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:21,358
level counts in there the earlier it's

1381
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,798
going to extinguish and you're going to

1382
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,440
need to relight it mhm my joints usually

1383
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:27,159
once you light it I can talk for 3 to

1384
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,200
five minutes and it's still lit because

1385
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:31,000
it just keeps getting cooler and cooler

1386
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,000
and cooler and cooler and it hasn't

1387
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,480
reached the combustion temperature

1388
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,079
because it doesn't have any heavy metals

1389
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,079
in it right nice yeah cleanliness is

1390
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:44,440
every cleanliness and effect is

1391
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:46,480
everything yeah then taste smoke ability

1392
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:50,119
I call it right after that is smok

1393
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,039
ability you don't want to you want to be

1394
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:54,720
a want to pick it up again yeah that's

1395
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:58,440
how the jars get empty right that's the

1396
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,959
test right jar absolutely so we do the

1397
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,720
jar test here of course for sure we're

1398
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,838
baked right now yeah yeah I feel great

1399
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:07,838
and it's like I'm baked but we smoked

1400
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:09,078
all day yesterday I mean I smoked a lot

1401
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:11,000
yesterday to wear I had to wear

1402
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:12,960
sunglasses we have to mention that we

1403
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,159
just spent two days at the 20th Ann

1404
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,400
annual Emerald cup why I'm a little

1405
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:19,719
froggy in the throat yeah you did a lot

1406
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,200
of interviews there what do you think oh

1407
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:24,480
man it's such a good time it was a

1408
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:26,558
really good event um I think there was a

1409
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,798
lot of skepticism going into to the

1410
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,440
event from a lot of people we're like

1411
00:55:27,798 --> 00:55:31,960
it's going to Oakland we're going from

1412
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,519
hippie to Hip Hop I heard that multiple

1413
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,960
times and you know cuz I'm from here

1414
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:38,759
this a local in the area uh people were

1415
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,639
like is everyone's car windows going to

1416
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,839
get broken in no car windows got broken

1417
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,400
in the first day I don't know about

1418
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:47,159
Sunday but I know the first day there

1419
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,760
was no windows broken I think the city

1420
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:51,199
really embraced the event which I love

1421
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,039
it I I love the fact that the Oakland

1422
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:56,439
City welc yeah the people from Oakland

1423
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,599
and you know the people that count were

1424
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,599
like welcoming Emerald cup which is

1425
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:03,000
great and I feel like so many of us

1426
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:04,960
showed up there were a lot of people

1427
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,519
from the industry you know you never

1428
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,880
know how events are going to be but I

1429
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:10,798
try to be as optimistic as possible of

1430
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,318
course and I'm hoping Tim Blake made the

1431
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:13,798
right decision and sure enough he did

1432
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:16,079
make the right decision it was a great

1433
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:18,599
event it was much smaller right but it

1434
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,400
was more intimate and I feel like those

1435
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:21,880
events are great and it's it's building

1436
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,680
blocks right so this is the building

1437
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,920
block for what's to come we can do this

1438
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:26,639
again next year and let's do it a little

1439
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,760
bigger and the year after that a little

1440
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,879
bigger than that and turn it into

1441
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,240
another amazing thing I mean you know

1442
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,400
you know one of the keys was it was easy

1443

1444
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,838
though it was an indoor event that easy

1445
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,760
access to Outdoors just a few steps away

1446
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:42,960

expose yourself as an emissary and that

1526

1638
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,920

1651
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,679
place with guests and doing interviews I

1652
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,838
saw it over the weekend it was pretty

1653
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,679
wild I'm lucky I fell in with homegrown

1654

1656
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:52,719

1658
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:59,078

1660
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:04,599
of video both entertainment and uh

1661
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:07,400
educational is online at homegrown

1662
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:09,960
cannabis Co and uh and then just

1663
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,318
recently I think maybe about a year ago

1664
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:16,838
he had an idea for what was is my third

1665
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:19,440
podcast now um uh Gua we like to say I

1666
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:23,400
Gua do you Gua stands for grow weed at

1667
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:28,559
home you know and uh I am the ultimate

1668
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:31,880
homeg grower Advocate 100 % and really

1669
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,920
it's kind of my last Bastion of the

1670
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,960
fight there's plenty of people out there

1671
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:39,798
fighting for legalization and I've

1672
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:41,838
fought for legalization and I have legal

1673
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:45,159
I don't want to get into how legal it is

1674
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:47,000
well so my last Bastion is as we

1675
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:49,960
legalize across the

1676
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,239
country you must

1677
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,278
recognize the right of hom Growers you

1678
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:58,000
know most places do as they go along

1679
01:05:55,278 --> 01:06:00,000
most places do but I think Arizona did

1680
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,159
not for a few years and then they

1681
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,920
changed it so for years if you lived

1682
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:09,598
within 25 or 50 miles of a

1683
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:12,960
dispensary you were required to buy your

1684
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,960
medicine really sad it's it's wrong for

1685
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,760
so many reasons it's just wrong for so

1686
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,240
many reasons and so I've really just you

1687
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,559
know I I I I talk the talk and I walk

1688
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:25,639
the walk and I grow my own weed at home

1689
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,760
and I put it up online and it was Matt

1690
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:31,078
idea to create grow weed at home with

1691
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,680
Kyle kushman nice and so uh yeah so

1692
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:34,119
luckily this was the greatest

1693
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:37,358
opportunity because we brought the

1694
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:40,400
podcast to the emerald cup and we did a

1695
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:43,679

1696
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:47,480

last prisoner project yeah okay and um

1722
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:59,838
so I met the delices uh homegrown can Co

1723
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:01,960
is sponsoring uh a movie about them and

1724
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:03,880
it's called Santa Marta gold that is so

1725
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,400
cool cuz that's the strain that he

1726
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,000
pretty much smuggled the most you know

1727
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:12,920
that was the preeminent strain and um

1728
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,318
and Matt Nate Hammer he's he's making

1729
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,960
the film so you know all this wonderful

1730
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:19,318
stuff he's done I have no doubt that

1731
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,520
it's going to be absolutely amazing they

1732
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:23,839
just haven't quite I think they were

1733
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:27,120
going to do a documentary but I think

1734
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:31,158
it's evolving into a full-on biopic wow

1735
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:33,559
you know and um and man just I I I can't

1736
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:36,559
even get into a good mood when I'm

1737
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:40,239
talking about this a man that lost 32

1738
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,719
years of his life and I think 37 total

1739
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:45,000
years but he served 32 years St I'm

1740

both had the them on multiple times

1758
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,960
they're great people but that's to me

1759
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:34,719
that's what this is all about that's why

1760
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,838
I do this when I it's a good you know I

1761
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,679
think it's a it's a good way to tell a

1762
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:40,960
story and to share the whole picture of

1763
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:44,000
the industry and and there is no

1764
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,640
industry without that right and that's

1765
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,158
the that's the big beautiful thing with

1766
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,279
you know and it's it's really sad that

1767
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:52,439
he did so much time and then we had luk

1768
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:54,400
Gazo and together they've done over 50

1769
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:58,279
years which is longer than I've been

1770
01:09:54,399 --> 01:10:01,279
alive and Eddie Le did a did a dozen y

1771
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:03,198
or or a dime you know and he's dead now

1772
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:05,719
he would have lived at least another 10

1773
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:08,919
years or 20 if he hadn't had to go

1774
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:12,198
through that [ __ ] so just realize

1775
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:16,399
how good we've got it now and stop stop

1776
01:10:12,198 --> 01:10:18,238
let letting the perfect be uh not

1777
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:21,238
letting things go forward you know

1778
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:27,119
because nothing is ever [ __ ] perfect

1779
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:30,439
and um sometimes you you have to embrace

1780
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:33,960
positive for positive see the forest for

1781
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:36,238
the trees you know baby steps are

1782
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,640
okay I think I think that's another

1783
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:39,158
thing we want to make Leaps and Bounds

1784
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,600
all the time but sometimes it's just a

1785
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:44,238
small step you got to grow one before

1786
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,400
you grow a GU before you go commercial

1787
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:48,879
you got to you

1788
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:51,960
know you got to do a lot of things

1789
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,159
before you can say I know it all not

1790
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,520
meaning I know it all but meaning like I

1791
01:10:54,158 --> 01:11:00,559
know enough I can get by now I can I

1792
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,120
could teach some others right I don't

1793
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,760
really know at all you know it's no I

1794
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,599
mean I there's for me it's like I'm

1795
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,000
constantly learning I'm Every Day I'm

1796
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:13,079
learning something new or uh learning

1797
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:17,880
something I forgot right right so this

1798
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:22,600
is a great great uh atmosphere and um a

1799
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:25,960
platform you know for um our industry

1800
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:29,560
needs more platforms yeah

1801
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,239
um and it's not just the Growers and

1802
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,400
it's not just the breed and when I say

1803
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:35,599
just what I mean is you know you know

1804
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:37,198
there are other people like the delices

1805
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,159
yeah that if they didn't bring in tons

1806
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,359
and tons of weed I wouldn't have been

1807
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:42,759
smoking weed at 12 years old being able

1808
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:45,039
to get it all the time except for the

1809
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,400
droughts we had droughts every year

1810
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:50,960
every year there was a drought month or

1811
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:53,039
two you got to go on a clean break yeah

1812
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,039
you know yeah or smoke Ian there was

1813
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:56,238
brown weed maybe sometimes but I wasn't

1814
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:58,319
really big on smoking the stuff that

1815
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:00,000
gave me headaches once I started smoking

1816
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,238
the good stuff I did not want to go back

1817
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,359
never look back but but you know it's

1818
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:05,439
also you know it's also in an odd way

1819
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:06,719
it's it's it's some of the people you

1820
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:08,879
know like I mentioned Billy Blackburn

1821
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,920
earlier who created the first commercial

1822
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,600
cloner for the easy clone you know and

1823
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,840
uh you know it's it's these all these

1824
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,600
Tech guys that we have to thank too in

1825
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,600
the early days that created the you know

1826
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,679
they they went through operation green

1827
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,079
Merchant yeah do you remember the guys

1828
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:27,880
that lost their inventories and lost

1829
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:31,359
their livelihoods seagull hydrarm went

1830
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:33,319
through it um a lot of personal people

1831
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:35,000
because the hydrarm stock got taken and

1832
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:37,119
they couldn't pay back that you know the

1833
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,719
the inventory they' taken in from all

1834
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,399
manufacturers light manufacturers you

1835
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:43,719
remember back in the day the Innovations

1836
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:47,359
they were trying to sell us water cooled

1837
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:49,158
lights man they tring agnetic so agnetic

1838
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:51,238
still makes water cooled lights I'm sure

1839
01:12:49,158 --> 01:12:53,638
that it's an advancement yeah I brought

1840
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:55,678
it home and I hooked it up once with a

1841
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:58,039
with a I'm like I shouldn't be building

1842
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,359

01:13:08,679 --> 01:13:11,679
higher prices when they know that

1849

advice be

1894
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:07,199
really I've never been asked or answered

1895
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:11,000
this question nice you know what popped

1896
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,000
into my head just show shows my [ __ ]

1897
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:17,840
priorities don't be shy in front of

1898
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,480
women you know I used to use this as a

1899
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,600
one of my speeches like I've given so

1900
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:22,839
many at normal conferences at hemp fests

1901
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,320
at all these bashes you got to get up

1902
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,719
and you got to say something right and

1903
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:30,079
one time I used to say to people you

1904
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:33,119
know don't be afraid of the

1905
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:35,039
cops don't like don't shy away from the

1906
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,000
cops what you got to do is when you see

1907
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,319
a cop on the corner standing there doing

1908
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,840
his thing make eye contact with him and

1909
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:44,920
say hi officer how are you doing today

1910
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:49,079
and what that does is it makes you

1911
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:51,158
getting used to um having an interaction

1912
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:52,960
with the cops so that the next time that

1913
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:55,638
you're walking around you got a backpack
