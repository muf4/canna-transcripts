10
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,659
we did it we did a pilot of the James

11
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,640
loud podcast in San Francisco it wasn't

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,558
really what we wanted for lighting you

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
know the context everything was good the

14
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,058
stuff we talked about was amazing but uh

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,500
yeah it's never gonna air we might share

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,539
it with friends and stuff like that down

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,460
the road but how you doing I'm doing

18
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,320
great man I'm glad you drugged me away

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,960
from the facility from work for a little

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,000
bit so we could do this yeah awesome

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,840
so we also filmed the cultivation

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,480
episode at your facility before you guys

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,739
were live like I guess you were live you

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,419
were just in the first couple weeks

25
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:02,640
before you had finished product

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,978
definitely yeah before our first harvest

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,060
yeah and so Chris does something really

28
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:10,438
special uh Chris go you grow livingsoil

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,939
at scale

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,759
which

31
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,579
I haven't seen done successfully too

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,100
much in the recreational world it's just

33
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,679
a very difficult thing to do

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,839
um what's your take on it yeah and also

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,200
we grow vertically on a tiered system

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,540
which makes it even crazier I don't know

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,100
anyone that's growing like you said

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,500
living soil and a two-tiered uh system

39
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:40,438
it's been quite the learning experience

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,000
to put it lightly I've been working on

41
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,459
this project for about six years

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,280
full-time we've been in operation at the

43
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,219
facility since August and it was all

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,920
ground up construction awesome

45
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,478
you guys do a real good job I I was

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,659
questioning when I first heard about you

47
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,700
guys were doing double stacked uh double

48
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,859
stacked in a huge tall room of living

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,439
soil beds and these beds have to weigh a

50
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,859
sh I don't know 1200 pounds of bed yes

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:13,259
and that's and then you do 1200 on yeah

52
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:15,659
it's wild 40 40 foot long runs uh

53
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,539
10 lights on the bottom 10 lights on top

54
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:21,060
and your rollers roll effortlessly yeah

55
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:24,239
they use like uh like a bicycle gear

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,000
type system uh it's from Montel racking

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,520
they're like a French Canadian group but

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,919
fantastic stuff and so you're doing a

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,680
no-till living soil correct I call it

60
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,318
low till like no-till would be not

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,319
disturbing the soil or the top soil at

62
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,119
all I say we are disturbing the topsoil

63
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,000
maybe the first couple inches or a few

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,700
inches so I'd call it low till just if

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,739
you want to get technical sure yeah and

66
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:52,079
your flower's great I think I think it's

67
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,180
gotten better actually you've done a cut

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,040
what this is on your second run now oh

69
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,700
gosh finished product or third run right

70
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:02,219
we just harvested our fourth room oh wow

71
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,679
yes but yeah definitely each room is

72
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,439
getting more dialed in just better and

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,719
better quality awesome poison gushers

74
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,639
yeah what do you think of poison gushers

75
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,280
different

76
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,458
um definitely the definition of exotic

77
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,519
in terms of its terpene composition yeah

78
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,280
tested over like two around 2.2 percent

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,620
but just based off of the composition

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,620
um would put it in an exotic class it's

81
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,680
not something you would taste or smell

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,519
typically in the California market and

83
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,700
that's because of its parents Afghani

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,799
times gushers so that Afghani um gives

85
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,919
it something really unique with the

86
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,260
sweet uh profile from the gushers yeah

87
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,818
yeah yeah what checks the Box yeah as

88
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,679
far as like it checks all the boxes

89
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,619
actually in my opinion I mean it has the

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,299
has a little bit of candy it has a

91
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,280
little bit of color it actually has

92
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,680
really good color fantastic color the

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,900
structure is amazing

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,480
and it's it's loud it's really loud

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,640
I would put it up there with maybe you

96
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,378
know other unicorn strains because it

97
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,119
does check like all the boxes that

98
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,620
people are looking for in the market I

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,719
think the biggest thing is just getting

100
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,640
people to get more familiar with it

101
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,000
right once we kind of get it out there

102
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,759
and uh have more people try it I think

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,978
they'll it'll create a bigger demand no

104
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,500
one has that cultivar on the west coast

105
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,599
so it's exclusive to us yeah I haven't

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,660
seen it anywhere yeah thanks Justin

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,820
appreciate it Justin uh yeah my partner

108
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,460
Justin he's now your partner too yeah

109
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:38,339
tissue culture and he does amazing work

110
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:40,560
I think uh you know start clean stay

111
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,519
clean that's his motto and he provides

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,759
amazing

113
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,859
amazing genetics it makes all the the

114
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,960
difference in terms of cultivation I

115
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,400
mean more vigorous plants are going to

116
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,138
get a better yield

117
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,679
um just a healthier overall better

118
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,699
program totally yeah so on my show what

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,579
we're going to do is a little bit of

120
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,280
blind tasting sweet and so we have three

121
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,019
different products here we have a one

122
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,599
that could be under any one of these

123
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,579
that's a five dollar or less gram we

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,979
have one that's a ten dollar or less and

125
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,198
one that's a 15 or more

126
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,879
and we're gonna smoke them blindly

127
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
without checking out the packaging

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,959
without even checking out the bud and

129
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,638
you're going to give me your thought on

130
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,099
what you think it is and then at the end

131
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,300
we'll do a grand reveal sounds great

132
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,300
I'll do it

133
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:32,839
can I dry it at first absolutely that's

134
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,840
a great idea

135
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:43,620
kind of bland not very terpy I think

136
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,840
it's Hydro it's all California wheat

137
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,180
yeah

138
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,918
yeah I definitely think it's Hydro

139
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,038
definitely think it's Hydro yeah for

140
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,038
sure

141
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,139
foreign

142
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,758
make sure it's burning evenly

143
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,839
there's chirps

144
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,978
within the California wreck Market what

145
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,918
I've seen is across the board you know

146
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:34,800
it's hard to predict what's what Terps

147
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,439
is usually a giveaway but not always

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,960
your stuff is super terpy but it also

149
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,478
Burns way cleaner and I think the thing

150
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,060
with the living soil is the effect

151
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:47,159
definitely so and I think that's why you

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,079
can charge more for it besides the fact

153
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,520
that it costs more to produce and it's

154
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,099
more of a pain in the ass I feel like

155
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,258
the initially initially over time it'll

156
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,780
it'll definitely save money right

157
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,300
so what kind of cost per pound are we

158
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,219
looking at typically with living soil uh

159
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,300
just on average we'll be able to get it

160
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,979
under 400 eventually yeah under 400 yeah

161
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,560
what kind of lighting are you guys using

162
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:13,139
we're going with fluence uh right now

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,019
we're using their spider 2ps yeah I

164
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,699
think they're about like 635 Watts I've

165
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,758
tested out probably like seven or eight

166
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:24,598
different LED companies before we chose

167
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,460
fluence we're actually going to be doing

168
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,918
their trial runs for their new fixtures

169
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,719
too which is really exciting for their

170
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,399
three PS I think is what they're called

171
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,960
so what I've noticed with the California

172
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,299
Market is

173
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,918
three years ago it was all [ __ ] and

174
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,180
like not all [ __ ] I shouldn't say

175
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,680
that but even some of the brands that

176
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,939
were like in the black market crushing

177
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,918
they came in the white market and it

178
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,800
sucked yeah I'm not gonna name names or

179
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,719
anything like that but it's really

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,240
interesting now I feel like even some of

181
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,400
the cheaper stuff is good and some of

182
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,340
the top tier you know stuff it's just

183
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,779
all over the board 100

184
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,179
inconsistency is tough I'm gonna take

185
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,918
one more hit of this yeah yeah go on to

186
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,620
the next but

187
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,719
um you put it out yeah

188
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,120
um no I think you're totally right I

189
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,699
think um the lower

190
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,759
quality is coming up even with the

191
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:18,478
cheaper or bigger produced Brands yeah

192
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,699
100 I mean I took a visit to one of the

193
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,019
bigger farms in Santa Barbara yeah I

194
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,840
think that close to a million square

195
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,579
feet of canopy oh yeah glass house it

196
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,579
was not glass house really is another

197
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:31,500
group I can't say sure

198
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,059
um I was blown away by their quality I

199
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,158
was like damn they're producing this at

200
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,899
scale like it's catching up I mean

201
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,658
granted a lot of that is being used for

202
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,458
extracts but but still I mean at scale

203
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:44,099
but I feel like there's a certain point

204
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,659
at scale that you cannot control

205
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,879
everything no matter what you look at

206
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,379
the boutique guys you look at this you

207
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,939
know there's there's this you know I

208
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:53,639
mean it's gotten bigger that I feel like

209
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,580
it's scaled up but there is definitely a

210
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,080
you know you pass the that threshold and

211
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,540
you cannot control the quality the same

212
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,940
as the guy who has 20 lights the guy who

213
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,500
has 100 lights you know I'm seeing guys

214
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,880
that you know that have a thousand

215
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,919
lights that are producing pretty [ __ ]

216
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,379
good weed and I want to try to show

217
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,139
people because where Adam about 8 000

218
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,000
square feet of canopy maybe 8 500 but I

219
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,720
want to show people we can put out

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,419
consistent quality Boutique flower

221
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,339
round after round Harvest after harvest

222
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,278
right I don't think anyone's been able

223
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,200
to like really do that consistently yeah

224
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,120
it's really difficult I mean there's 70

225
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,259
days in the life of a plant you screw up

226
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,720
one day

227
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,179
oh game over it's like screwing up one

228
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,120
year of a life of you know some a person

229
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,439
yeah so uh what do you think about that

230
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,019
first smoke that we had do you think

231
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,959
it's five dollars or less ten dollars or

232
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,879
less or fifteen dollars or more

233
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,338
what can I try the other two first

234
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,179
before or do I well just let me know

235
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,040
what you think and then you can change

236
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:56,099
it too okay

237
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,719
um either a five or ten dollar gram that

238
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,879
would be my guess

239
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,259
I'll give you my final answer at the end

240
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,259
your final final Final

241
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,700
remember the old hemp Wicks oh yeah you

242
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,220
gotta use a lighter to light the hemp

243
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,680
click and then I used to be big on those

244
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,200
thinking I was getting more flavor but

245
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,539
then I uh a buddy of mine he told me he

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,640
was like we got to think about no one's

247
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,319
actually testing the hemp wig for like

248
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,299
any kind of like chemicals or anything

249
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,060
so it's like you might as well be

250
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:32,519
smoking some butane yeah at a whatever a

251
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,018
few parts per million then not knowing

252
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,700
what you're actually smoking with the

253
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,740
hemp wig what do you think about the

254
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,620
drama with Josh and raw right now you

255
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,120
heard about any of that stuff ah I

256
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,120
didn't know I mean I just don't even

257
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,759
have time to like read into that stuff

258
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,399
I'm so like this literally in the weeds

259
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,838
right now yeah you're it's going crazy

260
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,259
over there and then people calling in

261
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,240
sick oh my gosh I mean it's you're not

262
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,700
just growing weed like I have to worry

263
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,980
about like right now network issues

264
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,259
mechanical equipment issues managing

265
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,778
people people calling out sick you know

266
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,100
it's just it's endless but yeah it's a

267
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:10,500
great learning experience and I'm

268
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,820
grateful that I get to do this every day

269
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,100
for a living

270
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,140
yeah I mean I think I know times are

271
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,879
tough all over it's it's great to be

272
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,778
able to have a job be able to do what we

273
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,639
love

274
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,320
you know if you look back at your 18

275
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,419
year old self would your 18 year old

276
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,940
self be happy with your be like hell

277
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:30,120
yeah you're going to do this no I was

278
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,440
super into cannabis even at 18 19.

279
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,019
that's when I really started like

280
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,000
getting into cultivation yeah

281
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,278
um actually growing some you know maybe

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,379
like five or six lights growing some

283
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,120
Tangerine Dream driving it down to Santa

284
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,799
Monica selling it to you know some

285
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,019
Armenians at the dispensary for like

286
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,078
four or five grand a pound that's when I

287
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,700
like really fell in love with the plant

288
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,919
um I definitely didn't think I'd be

289
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,200
doing this but

290
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,360
it was definitely a dream of mine then

291
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,240
so I'm like it's it's crazy that life

292
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,399
has come back full circle

293
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,440
yeah so uh what year was the first year

294
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,120
you smoked this already went out that

295
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,100
tells you something maybe this is the

296
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,839
five dollar gram right here

297
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,820
or maybe it's the 50s they tricked this

298
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,519
it's all

299
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,500
it's all lies it's all lies true it's

300
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,360
burning a little black too

301
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,078
yeah so the first one we didn't get an

302
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,940
oil ring off it but it did burn but oil

303
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,278
oil ring could just be the tightness of

304
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,860
the joint too well there's a lot to it

305
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,360
yeah I do like a good Oil ring on my

306
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,419
joints though see how black this is

307
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,579
though that is black yeah but yeah and

308
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,078
this was white yeah that bird white yeah

309
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:42,659
that burned pretty good

310
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,039
it was it it wasn't smooth but it burned

311
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,139
pretty well yeah it definitely wasn't

312
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,578
smooth you got a little initially you

313
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,560
got a lot of Terps but then the chirps

314
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:51,479
kind of faded a little bit

315
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,638
um most strains don't do good in a joint

316
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,278
all the way through well I think most

317
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,180
Growers don't grow good weeding to make

318
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,458
it taste good all the way through

319
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,599
because oh did you hear that guys yeah I

320
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,458
mean I think that has a lot to do with

321
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,339
it it's definitely genetic yeah there's

322
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,539
definitely truth to that but I think

323
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,980
that a lot of guys don't grow good

324
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:09,299
enough and that's the thing with so for

325
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,399
instance for breeding right like you

326
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,319
talk about guys that are breeding

327
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,940
um the hardest part about breeding is

328
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,680
not making the seeds it's doing the

329
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,660
selections being able to grow the weed

330
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,979
good enough so you can make selections I

331
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,600
think a lot of people were missing out

332
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,659
on that part you know yeah there's some

333
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,860
guys doing really good

334
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:27,539
a lot of guys are just making seeds and

335
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,579
it's like making seeds as a breeder like

336
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,740
that's not really breeding breeding is

337
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:32,458
doing the selections

338
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,320
um

339
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,939
yeah I was just up north at House of

340
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,379

341
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,620

the stuff I made with Jason up there and

344
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,799
I mean you're making some crazy stuff

345
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,659
like like the seeds we pop for the

346
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,219

347
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,620

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,259
aspect dude that's so great yeah I feel

353
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,958
like we're our industry should be more

354
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,039
about community and you know I feel like

355
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,599
doing the right thing we're already

356
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:11,338
doing the right thing by growing weed in

357
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
my opinion you know I think that

358
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,300
cannabis is something that should be

359
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,338
shared with everybody and I think making

360
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,319
seeds you're putting out amazing stuff

361
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,240
you know I think it's it's a positive

362
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,600
action growing cannabis is a positive

363
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,879
action it's something good for all of us

364
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,879
yeah 100 I agree man it's medicine

365
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,759
did go out again and what do you think

366
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,339
on that one you think the five the less

367
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,319
than 10 or the more than 15. I mean the

368
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,959
industry is so deceiving dude that could

369
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,000
be a 15 gram you know and we don't even

370
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,698
know it my opinion that should be the

371
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,820
five dollar gram I mean that tasted like

372
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:54,599
it just tasted like wheat like not even

373
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:58,079
weed like wet weed it did taste a little

374
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,019
wet I I just it also was a super dry

375
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:03,299
super yeah at the same time yeah right

376
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,759
well and there is you know like as far

377
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:08,099
as like testing and moisture content

378
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,679
that can be an issue with compliance and

379
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,620
everything else yeah definitely

380
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,599
so well should we get on to the last one

381
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,278
I guess are you ready yeah and then

382
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,899
we're gonna try some ears because yeah

383
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,399
[ __ ] yeah we gotta smoke some good weed

384
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,720
we gotta we gotta and it was some good

385
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,899
stuff but I feel like we won't be high

386
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,899
enough

387
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,859
we gotta redeem ourselves

388
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:44,939
you smoke cigars also no I don't I don't

389
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,259
smoke tobacco I don't smoke tobacco

390
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,360
either but I do like the occasional

391
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,578
cigar but I won't do blunts I mean even

392
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,860
though that's cigar but it's just not my

393
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:54,299
thing I used to do blends growing up

394
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,980
everyone smoked blind so it's the

395
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:57,838
easiest thing to roll

396
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,879
yeah one of my friends died from

397
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,779
esophageal cancer about three years ago

398
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,059
and

399
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:05,278

400
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,838
quit smoking cigarettes completely I

401
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,698
mean I didn't smoke a lot of cigarettes

402
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,100

465
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,780
fire

466
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,940
and you know so what's your opinion on

467
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,160
uh gas is it making a comeback I know

468
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,259
you got some fire go geog that shit's or

469
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,960
not Goji it's a Pine-Sol yeah it's a

470
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:36,779
Goji OG Fino and I'm glad you called it

471
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,340
gas because some people get gas confused

472
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:44,279
with fire or Zaza weed gas is just the

473
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:46,740
profile for OG

474
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:49,558
um but yeah we have the pine saw from

475
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:53,640
Bodhi uh very interesting doesn't smell

476
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:56,038
like your typical OG Fino uh we do have

477
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,960
the jungle cake yeah which is the Wi-Fi

478
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,460
times wedding cakes super strong by the

479
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,960
way I smoked that [ __ ] and it [ __ ]

480
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,160
yeah that was that that's some good

481
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,440
stuff yeah

482
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,340
okay so what is your take on the third

483
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:11,220
one that tastes probably the first one

484
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:13,619
might have been the terpiest that one

485
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,179
wasn't bad

486
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,359
um this one doesn't burn as much it

487
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:22,740
doesn't burn as much it wasn't harsh uh

488
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:28,859
wasn't super chirpy but it wasn't bad

489
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:32,099
I'm gonna say 15 5 and 10.

490

smoke weed there but

589
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,140
I mean I'm not surprised you're a member

590
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,779
of like a Swanky club like that with you

591

no no it's just a social club okay so

594
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,539
drink covid the reason I was a member

595
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,798
was you couldn't go out to eat they

596
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,179
closed all these restaurants and I like

597
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:29,339
good food and my friends like good food

598
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,259
so we ended up going there several times

599
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:32,879
a week at one point wait you didn't want

600
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:36,240
to cook for everyone well no we did that

601
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,980
too we did I mean I I would say that uh

602
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,480
you know from not working in the

603
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,159
restaurant industry anymore I definitely

604
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,960
got my fixed drink covered because we

605
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,059
always had parties at our houses our

606
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,620
friends had parties picked more wagyu

607
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:52,200
with my friends and yes

608
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:54,899
Pursuit Farms so Eric from Pursuit Farms

609
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,240
amazing dude uh

610
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,620
actually uh I introduced him to one of

611
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,440
my friends and he's growing these

612
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,678
amazing pigs and they're feeding a hemp

613
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,240
oh awesome so among other things I think

614
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,759
he's brewing a beer right now he's gonna

615
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,659
freaking feed the beer to him too uh

616
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,400
Japanese style oh that's awesome

617
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:17,940
so how's that smoking so far I feel like

618
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,500
this is uh uh 20 and up you know I'm

619
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,500
guessing 20 and up perps are good

620
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:27,780
I could smoke this one all day how

621
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,399
smooth is it it's really smooth do you

622
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,259
know what kind of papers he's using no

623
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,880
it'd be a good question to ask for sure

624
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,379
I like them I like the pattern on these

625
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,960
papers too but you got a nice Oil ring

626
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:41,360
on yours yeah but also that's credit to

627
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,360
how it's rolled to 100 for sure

628
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,058
we didn't even use the coffee didn't

629
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,919
need it

630
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:49,519
I do like the smell of coffee yeah

631
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,520
definitely

632
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,919
yeah it's interesting the California

633
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,740
Market is pretty uh

634
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,900
interesting in the sense that it's

635
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,298
freaking in its infancy you know where

636
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,038
it's going to be in 10 years 20 years 30

637
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:08,400
years or more

638
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,079
I mean who knows who knows we try to

639
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,360
compare it to alcohol all the time and I

640
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,240
think there is some interesting

641
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,740
comparisons to Prohibition and the end

642
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,779
of prohibition and cannabis there's

643
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,980
there's similarities but it's a it's a

644
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,899
different Beast I mean we have a

645
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,778
completely different I think cannabis

646
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,820
which there's more varieties of cannabis

647
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:28,619
than any other cultivated species of

648
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:29,399
anything yeah

649
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:31,558
um

650
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,200
yeah that says one thing about it you

651
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,940
know it's pretty impressive yeah no I

652
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,798
mean like you said we're just in its

653
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,080
infancy so I mean we have a long ways to

654
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:42,119
go I think anyone that tries to predict

655
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,418
anything about the future of our

656
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:48,058
industry especially in California or our

657
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:51,600
country they just don't don't know no

658
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:53,819
one knows what's going on seriously

659
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,558
yeah so what's your uh you think they're

660
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:58,619
gonna get rid of uh

661
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,480
traditional HPS and make everyone go LED

662
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,219
I think they already did I know but do

663
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,019
you think that's gonna really hold up

664
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,839
and you know I mean I guess it'll be

665
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:09,240
what's your opinion on it uh one I think

666
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,980
it's a great thing I mean you're using

667
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,659
LED too though right yeah we're using

668
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,240
the fluence I mean it's hard not to use

669
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,740
LED just because of the cost you know of

670
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,480
running anything else yeah if you're

671
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,419
doing anything at scale the cost of

672
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,940
power but also I think people that

673
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:26,759
haven't made the switch they're just

674
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,640
a little stuck in their ways sure um

675
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,619
because the technology has caught up and

676
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,179
you're clearly able to get quality I

677
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,918
mean I mean I'm already not even using

678
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,259
adjustable Spectrum now with the

679
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,240
adjustable Spectrum you can maybe HPS

680
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,038
like you can I mean to a degree it'll

681
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,339
mimic the Spectrum right you can set

682
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:47,400
something almost to a degree but I think

683
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:49,199
Spectrum change we're not there yet yeah

684
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,580
because there's some companies like

685
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,140
science I think they went out of

686
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,298
business they were big on Spectrum

687
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,159
change we're just not quite there yet

688
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:57,058
with the formula I've tried those lights

689
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,640
out

690
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:02,339
like with fluence it's a white broad

691
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,259
spectrum it works from start to finish

692
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:05,939
so from propagation all the way to

693
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,619
flower you don't have to change anything

694
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,880
and that's actually better for the plan

695
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:14,339
especially with LEDs but I do find with

696
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,799
certain cultivars they just don't like

697
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:19,980
LED lighting that could be due to the

698
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,778
breeding uh just the genetics I mean who

699
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,360
knows well it's just like some some

700
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:27,298
cultivars perform better under HPS and

701
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,339
some perform better under a CMH and LEDs

702
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:32,339
same thing yeah blue dream I think does

703
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:34,619
really well under under traditional HPS

704
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,058
lights I didn't know that back in the

705
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,278
day yeah we used to go out just freaking

706
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:40,019
flourished it still does I mean it makes

707
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,480
sense you know because there were no

708
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,980
LEDs back then when blue dream was out

709
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,960
totally yeah

710
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,200
but yeah I mean I think a couple of my

711
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,419
friends have done like CMH versus HPS

712
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,400
and it's funny like especially in that

713
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,460
Spectrum some stuff does way better into

714
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,900
the CMH 100 wise yeah

715
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,960
so

716
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,480
it's real I mean it's interesting how

717
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,000
far we've come but still how far the

718
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:10,980
industry really has to go oh man

719
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,720
so far I mean in 10 15 20 years

720
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,400
if it's federally legal like

721
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,440
everything's going to be ran like a food

722
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,419
food facility or a medical grade

723
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,919
facility kind of like what you're you

724
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:23,700
know doing here with the lab you're

725
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,320
running like a real laboratory yeah yeah

726
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,659
I mean they're the government's going to

727
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,759
get involved of course on a federal

728
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,960
level and it's going to change things I

729
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,058
mean

730
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,278
once they learn more we educate them

731
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:37,259
more they learn from us yeah because

732
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,419
it's like people from the state you know

733
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,579
they don't they don't know that much

734
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:44,820
like we have to kind of educate them as

735
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:49,019
far as what what we need yeah

736
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:52,079
well it's like FDA ABC all these Federal

737
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:54,359
entities yeah you know you know it's

738
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,519
it's really interesting as far as

739
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,759
[ __ ] it could go in multiple different

740
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,259
directions definitely but I hopefully

741
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,759
the quality be going up that's that's

742
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,379
one thing I've seen over the last but

743
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,658
then it plateaus right so then it

744
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,700
plateaus and you got a lot of guys that

745
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,860
grow Rockwell and I think Rockwell's

746
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,860
okay I think there's some people

747
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,019
crushing it yeah but for the most part I

748
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:19,439
see a lot of mediocre rock wool and then

749
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,179
Coco I see amazing absolutely amazing

750
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,460
cocoa soil for the most part the guys

751
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,740
who have the balls to grow soil indoors

752
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,600
you know there's a lot of [ __ ] risk

753
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,519
involved here one thing there's a lot of

754
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,439
people are scared to do it yeah I think

755
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,940
especially if you're already being you

756
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,798
know you're successful you've been grown

757
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,778
in Cocoa forever why would you switch to

758
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,940
soil I would just I don't blame them I

759
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:41,640
don't blame anyone yeah yeah because

760
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,440
it's it's probably the biggest learning

761
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,320
curve to make that switch and it's the

762
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,778
hardest media to grow in consistently it

763
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,278
also has the most buffer though too you

764
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:52,140
can if you recognize what's going on

765
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,480
with the plant yeah you know what I mean

766
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,059
you have you have a much bigger buffer

767
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,759
than you do with rock wool or with cocoa

768
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:01,139
to where identifying problems you know

769
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,058
that could be nutrient related

770
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:07,200
especially you know you're talking about

771
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:10,019
food yeah so bigger buffer but I think

772
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,778
just more issues to deal with especially

773
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,819
indoors and it's harder to hit certain

774
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,819
metrics you know if you're trying to

775
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:20,099
hit yield I think also it's hard for

776
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:23,879
people to get density out of their flour

777
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:25,740
too and living soil mm-hmm

778
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,600
I do like living soil though I like the

779
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,759
way it smokes yeah I like main effect

780
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,500
how do you feel after smoking that I

781
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,179
feel good yeah I feel high yeah but I

782
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,980
feel good like it's it's definitely like

783
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,500
a clean High clean

784
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,659
um and that's yeah across the board for

785
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,579
the most part it's usually a cleaner

786
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,980
version of the eye you get from stuff

787
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,480
that was grown in

788
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,880
cocoa or rock wool I mean not that those

789
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,278
are bad I I like smoking whatever else

790
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,020
if it's Skittles or if it's [ __ ] OG

791
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,480
and it's grown oil it doesn't matter

792
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:56,519
they all smoke pretty good you know as

793
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,099
far as Sour Diesel back in the day oh

794
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,139
yeah of course but soil living soil Sour

795
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,879
Diesel that would be wild but I don't

796
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,740
know if that makes sense to grow that

797
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,380
commercially but we do it takes so much

798
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,839
longer for one thing and problems just

799
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,220
the length of time yeah to grow you

800
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,579
don't like growing 12 weeks of flour

801
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,159
yeah you can't afford to just need a

802
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:19,019
bigger facility yeah and money to burn

803
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,899
yeah but we do have this the original

804
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,940
Super Silver Haze so you do I saw the

805
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:25,678
plants those look nice like everything

806
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,720
you guys are growing that that whole

807
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,480
tester room this stuff looks really good

808
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,399
thanks man I appreciate it eye candy I

809
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,720
can't animal cookies the animal cookies

810
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,339
looks ridiculous it doesn't even look

811
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,980
like animal cookies and those are huge

812
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,359
nugs yeah yeah super excited to bring

813
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,419
that back

814
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:45,240
yeah animal cookies that was from Sirius

815
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:48,299
in the bay yeah he's he's since passed

816
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,120

818
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,319

820
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,119
parking lot at a high times Cannabis Cup

821
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,700
and maybe 2013. well no maybe it was

822
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,798
even earlier than that maybe it was 2010

823
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,298
or 11. the first one was in 2010 in San

824
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,278
Francisco it sounds about right yeah

825
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,319
yeah that was cool the first one was

826
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,659
interesting it's like the those cups

827
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:16,558
changed from back in the day you know

828
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:20,220
even Amsterdam to to the US and how they

829
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,599
went from 2012 to uh though they had

830
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,220
they haven't had one in a while but the

831
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,319
last one that they had and the last ones

832
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,120
that they've had for a little while uh

833
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,398
it's like disco the old ones were like

834
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,619
the classic disco and once disco's gone

835
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,418
it's gone forever even though you can

836
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,000
try to do it it's just not quite the

837
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:37,980
same so does our animal cookies does it

838
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,278
do you remember what animal cookies look

839
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,778
like back then yeah

840
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:44,038
silly the buds the buds look bigger and

841
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:46,679
it could be the tissue culture it could

842
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,720
be the growing it could be alive so I've

843
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,519
never seen animal cookies other than in

844
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,100
a bag I never saw it growing on the

845
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,658
planet same you know and I think the

846
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:58,019
smell of it is pretty freaking amazing

847
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,539
it definitely has that that almost uh

848
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:03,960
doughy kind of [ __ ] cookie smell to

849
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:06,480
it sweet it's it's Unique for sure sweet

850
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,798

851
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,000
pain in the ass to grow back in the day

852
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,519
