00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,439
for coming on the show we've been

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,320
talking about doing this for a little

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,759
while you know we met not so long ago uh

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,599
we met at the so at the connected event

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,679
where you spoke uh and talked about your

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,280
your under canopy lighting yeah and I

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,399
was really excited to hear that it was

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,840
you know a success and I've heard from

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
other people that it was a success and

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
now we're going to be triing them in our

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
spot here and I'm assuming it's going to

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,960
be a great success too I'm super excited

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,840
about it yeah I'm uh I'm gonna go ahead

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,600
and say it'll probably be a a smashing

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,120
success here but excited to see I'm

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,520
excited to see it's the Natural

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,519
Evolution I've had friends that have

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,399
been talking about this for 5 years

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,600
saying this is what this is this is

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,920
going to happen and I'm telling you that

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,239
this is going to change the game and

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,118
then you did it and I'm like okay so

31
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,000
here it is yeah my buddy Justin he was

32
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,920
talking about this for years and you

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,680
actually executed and I think the

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,680
product is great I mean as far as I I've

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,840
seen so far it's great some people are

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,680
even using two rows yeah oh yeah so one

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,040
one every foot yeah pretty much so let's

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,680
talk a little bit about your lights

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,159
first you know I think the the best

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
place to start is like where the need

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,400
and like where the idea for faven came

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,479
from and you know so I've been growing

43
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,359
for about 15 years now and 10 like 10 of

44
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,078
those at you know somewhat of a large

45
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,959
scale you know I think scale gets

46
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:44,078
redefined every like two to three years

47
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,959
right like 700 lights two years ago was

48
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,959
a lot now 700 lights is a pretty

49
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,319
standard facility right and right you

50
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,519
know couple of hoop houses in 2012 you

51
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,879
were doing it you know 20 lights in 2012

52
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,879
you were you were doing it you know so

53
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,478
scale gets

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,640
redefined but um you know where the

55
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,920
underc canopy really came from was um

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,200
I got a job at connected and alien Labs

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,000
there in Sacramento and the head of

58
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,400
cultivation there was um a big a a

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,840
previously big a um R&amp;D just wizard to

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,239
be honest with you he was I learned a

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,200
lot from the guy um and one day he walks

62
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,319
in and he's like all right we're going

63
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,280
to do under canopy trials and

64
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,679
intercanopy trials and I was like I have

65
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,360
so much to do you're going to add this

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
on my plate like I was not happy about

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,080
it I'll be super super honest with you I

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,519
was like really not happy about it but

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,280
then you see them and then you start

70
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,920
turning them on and then it only takes a

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,158
couple days of watching the plants

72
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,759
sufficiently lit in a whole different

73
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:45,280
you know really kind of

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,039
reworking our idea of lighting the plant

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,840
right and it only takes a few days and

76
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,919
that's kind of where it all spurred from

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,400
but you know I worked from I worked for

78
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,158
connected for a year and you know every

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,080
time I get the chance I I shout them out

80
00:02:54,158 --> 00:03:00,399
because they really gave me you

81
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,800
know a great Launchpad for

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,319
just about everything in the legal

83
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,000
cannabis space like it's it was very

84
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:06,759
hard to break into legal cannabis you

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,680
know a couple years ago and little

86
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,199
easier now but man you really had to

87
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,799
know somebody to get into a facility

88
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,318
back in 2020 you know and it was it was

89
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,400
tough going so um big shout out to

90
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,679
connected for really laying the

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,439
foundation for successful cultivation at

92
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,439
scale like I learned so much in the year

93
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,959
I was there um you know after I left I

94
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,318
kept pulling the under canopy thread

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,158
just because I knew something was there

96
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:34,679
and there really wasn't anybody on

97
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:36,318
market doing it right and um I think I

98
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,799
told this story at the talk you were at

99
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:44,000
but I walked into my my partners partner

100
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,480
in faven uh his office and it was just a

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,519
day where I was frustrated or something

102
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,158
I don't know and I came in and I was

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,120
just kind of complaining about every

104
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,239
product on market and how these

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,000
companies with like some kind of under

106
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,000
kopy light were just they just didn't

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
understand they didn't get the big

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,479
picture like they were lighting guys

109
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,680
they weren't Growers right right they

110
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,039
did didn't understand anything about the

111
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,360
growing potential like they didn't they

112
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,759
didn't understand the skew as a whole um

113
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,959
and so my partner just kind of looked up

114
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,239
from his computer stale face just looked

115
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,040
at me and was like then do something

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
about it like make your own like you

117
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,919
stop complaining kind of thing and like

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,519
that day you know faven was was born so

119
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,918
um you know faven was created out of the

120
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,159
need to provide Growers with the right

121
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,719
tool for the job you know like I am a

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,360
grower first I'm still a grower first

123
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,680
first like faven takes the majority of

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,000
my week now but first thing I do when I

125
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,280
get up in the morning is check my graphs

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,720
and make sure everything watered you

127
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,239
know so I'm very much still in the

128
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,759
throws of growing and um there was

129
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,478
nothing that really was there that could

130
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,240
handle the rigors of of scale

131
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,319
cultivation you know like putting a

132
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,478
light underneath your underneath your

133
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,839
plants are they're subject to you know

134
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:53,680
water down there they're subject to

135
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,399
sprays like there's a lot you know it

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,360
there was a lot that went into actually

137
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,279
designing a light that fits into

138
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,520
facility workflows right um we nailed it

139
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,719
with faven it's the killer product so

140
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,198
but yeah that's kind of where it all

141
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,600
started so I've been been working with

142
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,720
under canopy for about four years now

143
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,360
and um fav's been selling lights for

144
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,840
since June so it's been 10 months not

145
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,120
even nine months when you guys hit the

146
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,399
ground running oh yeah oh yeah and we

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
you know we knew how to go about it and

148
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,478
we knew we knew to get the product in

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,240
the hands of the right Growers and um

150
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,959
bear up in reading a golden state bear

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,120
cannabis was one of our first actually

152
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:35,599
our first tester and um we knew he was

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,840
going to tell us if we were on to

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
something or if we were faking the funk

155
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,959
and you know I got a call from him like

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,360
three weeks in and he was like geez like

157
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,038
we have six more weeks to go and it

158
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,639
already looks like a like a banger you

159
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:51,279
know so um you know we just we we really

160
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,400
hit the ground running

161
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,439
and gosh it's been a whirlwind sense man

162
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,959
it really has I'm yeah it seems like

163
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,279
you're super busy every time I see

164
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,439
you're on the phone and it's always

165
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,119
something yeah um I actually I actually

166
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,759
have this week was the first week that I

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,680
felt like I had the team in place to

168
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,160
really really start executing on the

169
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,199
bigger larger goals and the bigger

170
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,080
vision of faven and um it feels really

171
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,520
good to get there I me tell you that

172
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,800
like having the right team around you

173
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,598
can make everything you know the right

174
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,120
team is everything you know because you

175
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,560
can't do it all yourself but you need

176
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,439
people that would do the job if as good

177
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,598
if not better than you when they're

178
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,199
doing it you know they represent you

179
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,199
whether you know if you're a cultivation

180
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,319
facility whether it's a grower that you

181
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,560
know but they're an extension of

182
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,879
yourself if you have a team you all work

183
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,959
together it's a fine-tune machine yep

184
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,360
that's what it's all about yeah you know

185
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,598
that stuff makes me smile yeah it's it's

186
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,000
it's the fun part like building a

187
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:47,519
business is a little scary because I've

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,759
never done it before yeah you know and I

189
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,639
like not to repeat myself again but I've

190
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,160
just been growing like I've just been

191
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,439
growing you know and I have a Consulting

192
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,720
business but like that's me yeah growing

193
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,680
you know it's way different yeah um so

194
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,479
it's it's been a lot of learning um I

195
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,560
love the learning I'm very uncomfortable

196
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,279
right now so I have to learn to get more

197
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,280
comfortable well you like getting kicked

198
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,519
in the nuts cuz that's what happens when

199
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,079
you start a business and I'm going

200
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,279
through similar stuff like it's it's

201
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,918
like waking up getting kicked in the

202
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,399
nuts a couple times and smiling you know

203
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,598
and then knowing that tomorrow you're

204
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,519
probably G to get kicked in the Nets

205
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,360
again but it's okay because you got your

206
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,839
business and you know it's fun yeah and

207
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,960
today I'm sitting with James lad on his

208
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,719
podcast so I mean come on yeah seriously

209
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,478
I mean it's it's it's an adventure and

210
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,120
there's a lot of unknown and there's

211
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:35,000
stuff where you're like oh next time I

212
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,598
do it I'll do it this way I mean I think

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,800
I've learned a lot I think distribution

214
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,199
is extremely important no matter what

215
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,639
you do distribution is so important

216
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,919
having those distri doesn't matter how

217
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,598
good your product is I mean you always

218
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,598
want to focus on the product but really

219
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,800
the distribution totally is just as

220
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:53,680
important if not more important than the

221
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,079
product because there's a lot of

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,478
mediocre [ __ ] that sells I'm not saying

223
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,560
people should make mediocre stuff but

224
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,038
I'm saying that they have good

225
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,639
distribution and mediocre stuff sells

226
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,800
exactly you really have to it would be

227
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,800
very easy for me to just dive into the

228
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,879
unit at all times but really I have to

229
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,319
know that we did a great job designing

230
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,520
this we went through many iterations to

231
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,360
get to where we're at today this is a

232
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,839
fully fleshed out product this isn't a

233
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,800
version one two or three this is our

234
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,799
version right we will iterate in the

235
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,720
future but smaller tweaks like we don't

236
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,918
have R&amp;D samples going out to customers

237
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,280
this is a fully fleshed out version so

238
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,839
it would be very easy to just keep

239
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,158
diving in and keep tweaking and keep

240
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,879
tweaking but my where I'm most needed is

241
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,200
the distribution channels and getting it

242
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,360
in the hands of Growers and and and

243
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,839
really kind of breaking down that

244
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,038
barrier of under canopy seeming like a

245
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,880
gimmick you know because it was kind of

246
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,199
a joke for a while well and I I think

247
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,639
with most things if you tell people I'm

248
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,839
G to get 25% more

249
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,639
yield or you I'm G to get you 25% more

250
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,279
yield they're going to laugh at you yep

251
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,078
you know because we've heard it so many

252
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,439
times over the years I've heard it time

253
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,120
and time time and time again you're

254
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,560
going to get 25% more you're going to

255
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,720
get 50% more all these fictitious

256
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,239
numbers typically and you came through

257
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,959
with something that actually gets you a

258
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,159
bigger yield yeah yeah underc canopy and

259
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:17,639
faven in particular is is the most

260
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,439
revolutionary thing since since the

261
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,720
teros 12 right since you know substrate

262
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,040
monitoring came out because we watched

263
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,720
facility

264
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:30,599
efficiencies you know increase so

265
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,278
substantially from like 2020 to 2022 you

266
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,680
know just everybody got better at

267
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,278
growing because we now could see inside

268
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,919
in the substrate and so underc canopy is

269
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,399
very much in that same vein where is

270
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,838
going to be like if you do not have this

271
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,519
in your facility it is going to be

272
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,560
extremely hard for you to compete and

273
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,639
it'll cost you money yeah I mean you're

274
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,199
GNA leave it on the table for sure

275
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,799
you're leaving it literally leaving it

276
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,079
on the table there go I mean uh it's

277
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,359
funny because I remember you know so

278
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,399
I've I've been doing this a while you

279
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,000
know and back in the day you know I'm

280
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,759
talking in the '90s 2000s it was two

281
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,600
pounds of light was good like you

282
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,278
literally when I was growing cookies

283
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,278
back in the day I would get 3/4 of a

284
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,159
pound per light with the you know and

285
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,799
that was acceptable it wasn't good but

286
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,879
the prices were so high it was a whole

287
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,359
different thing exactly um now the

288
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,600
prices are much lower and the the yields

289
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,759
are much higher yeah you know two pounds

290
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
is like eh yeah you know for a lot of

291
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,838
people and there's still people that are

292
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,040
okay with two pounds but as a commercial

293
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,279
cultivator two pounds is kind of rough

294
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,719
you know if you look at your cogs you

295
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,600
know look at what you're leaving on the

296
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,680
table looking at your potential and

297
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,759
we're talking about potential yeah we're

298
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,679
talking yield potential right and yield

299
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,600
potential without sacrificing quality I

300
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,638
think you know a lot of this is going a

301
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,000
lot of this podcast will be about yield

302
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,720
potential and that but really the thing

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,120
with THC canopy and the thing with faven

304
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,440
and why it took us so long to get to

305
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,480
Market and is because we prioritized the

306
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,200
quality of the of the extra yield as

307
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
well right it's not just like hey here's

308
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,480
extra yield because you can't

309
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
we we can't just boof out our plants and

310
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,759
expect it to sell on the market it

311
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,959
doesn't work like that well you went and

312
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,799
focused on the the problem part of the

313
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,159
plant which is the smalls so many people

314
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,639
have tons of Smalls Smalls are a big

315
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,958
thing right now people are buying Smalls

316
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,600
left and right people are going to hate

317
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,039
me real soon man when they realize the

318
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,839
smalls are going away seriously and how

319
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,120
so what kind of decrease do you get in

320
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,600
your smalls so I'd say industry standard

321
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,720
you know um without under canopy you're

322
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,480
looking 15 to 20% is a acceptable run I

323
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,120
think genetic to genetic right we're

324
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,519
looking difference well and we'll kind

325
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,039
of leave genetic variation out of the

326
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,600
conversation because we won't get

327
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,399
anything done if we talk genetic to

328
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:46,040
genetic sure but you know we're really

329
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,600
looking for 5% and really that 5% is

330
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,958
they're still purple they're still

331
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,240
mature they just may not meet the size

332
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,319
requirement like they're completely

333
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,320
mature and

334
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,879
THC color uniformity they just may not

335
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,360
have the size so it's a true small right

336
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:02,838
but there's no more greens Smalls right

337
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,079
like there's none like and in in sack

338
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,079
where I'm based out of you know Green

339
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,679
Smalls fetch $100 to $200 less per pound

340
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,159
than purple Smalls same genetic oh yeah

341
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,519
so you're talking a revenue increase

342
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,399
just right there you know and then you

343
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,000
talk the yield and then you talk you

344
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,198
know the the uniformity of Bud in the a

345
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,039
bags right anytime we talk yield or I

346
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:25,120
talk yield I'm only talking about the

347
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,360
bags that go at the highest price yeah

348
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,879
that's all that matters right now is how

349
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,759
many bags go at the highest price from

350
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,600
that

351
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,799
right that's your yield it's interesting

352
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,800
because every grow is different and some

353
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,519
people two you know two pounds of light

354
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,759
is is their minimum and like anytime two

355
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,879
pounds of light comes across the board

356
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,240
on yield they get a little nervous you

357
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,958
know and three pounds is where we need

358
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,680
to be but you know unfortunately yield

359
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,518
is the fastest and the easiest way to

360
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:53,638
decrease your cost it really is and it's

361
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,000
really unfortunate but it's where we are

362
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,799
at in the market it's really pinched The

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,519
Growers you know I feel like I feel like

364
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,120
a lot lot of people in this industry can

365
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,799
kind of doesn't matter how well the

366
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,198
Growers do they still have a job they

367
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,639
still make their margin everything's

368
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:09,319
fine but it's really really those

369
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,919
margins have compressed on The Growers

370
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,879
and you know faven is here to really put

371
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,838
that ball back in the Growers Court like

372
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,799
we really want this tool in the hands of

373
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,800
the grower so that they can expand their

374
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,799
margins they can you know hire the help

375
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,278
they need they can live a comfortable

376
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,759
life like they should you know so

377
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,320
instead of The Growers being squeezed

378
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,198
now like we're really putting the power

379
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,519
back to the cultivator the industry's

380
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:35,479
been very rough on cultivators in

381
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,120
general you know our margins have

382
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,759
compressed a lot where yeah everybody

383
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,240
else has kind of maintained some kind of

384
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,958
margin but cultivators have been

385
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,120
absolutely demolished just getting

386
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,239
killed yeah and it's it's unfortunate

387
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,320
we're going back to We Are Farmers now

388
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,680
and same thing with farmers of lettuce

389
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,600
and tomatoes and it's it's all the same

390
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,679
thing we all get treated the same and

391
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,959
you know I think using the platform and

392
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,599
and using the tool the under canopy tool

393
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,319
it really is going to bring back a lot

394
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,480
of power to the cultivators well so when

395
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,680
you talk about quality what do you

396
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,879
attribute that to you attribute to the

397
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,319
Spectrum uh well I'm sure there's many

398
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,078
factors yeah quality you know I think in

399
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
and spectrum is a big one and that you

400
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,399
want to talk about difference in

401
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,639
genetics there man you know some you

402
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,440
know crazy crazy Varian is some plant

403
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,399
perform better under HPS and some

404
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,880
perform better under CMH and some Led

405
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,958
You Know It's Just it's all over the

406
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,039
place yeah so we so we kind of

407
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:36,599
approached that um because you know HPS

408
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,120
and LEDs are completely different light

409
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,399
sources so we did not want to treat them

410
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,919
the same um and HPS very high in red

411
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,120
orange yellow right um very easy to kind

412
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,679
of strip that plant of the excess

413
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,078
nitrogen that's kind of built up in it

414
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,519
it's easier at least for me I know other

415
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,719
people have

416
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,078
other uh instances but you know it's

417
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,360
it's easier for me to pull color

418
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,039
underneath an HPS bulb and most likely

419
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,919
that has to do with being able to strip

420
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,000
that nitrogen out yeah so when we went

421
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,879
to design the Spectrum to fit underneath

422
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,159
a you know an HPS top light I really

423
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:17,159
pulled back on my days of mixing metal

424
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:19,879
halides and HPS up top checkerboarding

425
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:22,078
those rooms and how turpy and how just

426
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,519
yeah how exceptional that weed was right

427
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,638
because you just got a full spectrum

428
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,360
there for your plan it's absorbing just

429
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,360
about everything is fully represented in

430
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,519
a in a mixed Spectrum so what we did is

431
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,318
is we really looked at bringing in some

432
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,039
full spectrum diodes but we wanted to

433
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:39,519
make sure that we still took care of the

434
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,799
farther red right so we've got a nice

435
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,759
balance of a little more white light and

436
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,758
definitely some farther red some 660

437
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,600
some 680 make sure we're getting that

438
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,240
pull out of the plant make sure we're

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,000
there on the color side of things right

440
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,799
conversely with the toplight LEDs

441
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,240
um I'm not a huge fan of how lacking in

442
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,039
red most of the toplight LEDs are you

443
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,318
know most they really really

444
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,278
underperform in the Red Spectrum and you

445
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,879
know if you look at a a regular chart

446
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,799
that a lighting company puts out it

447
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,439
looks like it has plenty of red but it

448
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,958
once you put it on your plants you can

449
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,800
just tell right it's just kind of

450
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,799
lacking right and white spectrum is

451
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:21,318
always going to deliver a massive yield

452
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,078
like we I think we've established that

453
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,679
like the wider your spectrum the more

454
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,879
full your spectrum you're really really

455
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,039
going to you're going to see a massive

456
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,600
yield and that's great we all need yield

457
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,679
so what we did was we kind of took that

458
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,759
lack of red and just reversed it right

459
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:42,679
we put full red um almost full red um

460
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,120
into our our Spectrum that's slated to

461
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:48,000
go underneath the LED uh top lights and

462
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,000
cultivators will call me like week seven

463
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,360
and they're like dude my lowers are

464
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,278
purple my tops are purple like they're

465
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,800
already on their way I usually don't get

466
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:59,039
this for another 10 days like and and

467
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,240
you can just tell that they're not only

468
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,958
excited they're relieved because they

469
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,000
can they know this product is going to

470
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,438
meet the demand that the consumers are

471
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,919
asking for and they're going to have the

472
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,720
extra yield too like they're going to

473
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,520
have the extra yield but but the whole

474
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,439
plant and all of that product is better

475
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,879
yeah top to bottom you know so we take a

476
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,679
lot of pride in the Spectrum balancing

477
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,439
that we introduced um I think it's

478
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,559
killer I love it um I get conversations

479
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,319
all the time when people want to know

480
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,279
the intricacies of it and I'll I'll geek

481
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,038
on them with forever dude how does your

482
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,480
light affect stretching depends on how

483
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:40,240
you irrigate yeah so if you and we're

484
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,240
actually um Co not coincidentally uh not

485
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
on purpose doing a side by side of one

486
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,359
gallons and two gallons with thunder

487
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,519
canopy on them yeah and you can really

488
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:51,279
tell that the plants in the two gallons

489
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,319
have a lot more resources a lot more

490
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,399
water availability so they can grow a

491
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,720
lot more right they can kind of put on

492
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,120
that extra size yeah um

493
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,519
and for everybody still growing in one

494
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,038
gallons because we still I do some

495
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,519
genetics in one gallons and some in two

496
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:10,960
gallons some just don't root in that

497
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:13,759
well right so in the the one gallons um

498
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,079
what we see is they won't stretch as

499
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,798
much right there's less resources

500
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,519
available to them and you can irrigate a

501
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:22,879
little differently yes and and you can

502
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,319
give them what they need yes but it all

503
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,720
depends in substrate size if you've got

504
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:30,359
a bigger substrate that plant's going to

505
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:32,279
keep going you know so um and then

506
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,279
something else kind of on that same vein

507
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:37,599
is I see a lot of people over irrigate a

508
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,158
lot I want to say over watering is

509
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,359
probably the number

510
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,400
one issue that a lot of cultivators have

511
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,119
um especially novice cultivators right

512
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,240
it's easy to just give your plants water

513
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,798
you know every morning cuz the book says

514
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,240
too you know and what underc canopy does

515
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,599
is it actually helps them dry out a

516
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,240
little better so people will call me all

517
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,759
the time and they're like this is the

518
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,640
best room I've had top to bottom top

519
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,519
Cola bottoms everything and our charts

520
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,840
are better and I'm like oh okay yeah and

521
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,038
in my head I'm like okay you probably

522
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,319
were oversaturating just a touch you

523
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,240
know a lot of rock Woolf slab guys that

524
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,519
are like oh my goodness like this is

525
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,000
crazy you know like Coco kind of kind of

526
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,480
dialed in but rockwool slabs or uh Hugo

527
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,759
guys yeah I get that all the time and

528
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,880
it's I'd say it's about seven out of 10

529
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,919
times when I get that call it's the rock

530
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,919
wool right 50% increases

531
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,400
yields exactly why it's kind of relative

532
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,000
but we can talk talk about GRS per

533
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,480
square foot or pounds per light whatever

534
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,480
whatever anybody wants to talk about you

535
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,880
know so that everybody understands

536
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,599
exactly what we're talk we're not saying

537
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,919
we gave you know this guy got 100% yield

538
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,279
because he was at one pound of light

539
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,880
like we're not I'm not here to sure to

540
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,079
fudge the numbers I'm I'm really not no

541
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,320
I think that's great I think the

542
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,158
product's great I appreciate it what do

543
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,439
you

544
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:55,880
attribute going from two pounds to four

545
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,720
pounds of light and then actually two

546
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,400
pounds to three pounds yeah and then

547
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,640
three lounds to now potentially touching

548
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,038
four maybe a little over four oh yeah

549
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,919
what do you think the big change was

550
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,558
originally you think that basically

551
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,120
monitoring dryback uh basically crop

552
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,279
steering I think crop steering is the

553
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,558
the easier answer right it's definitely

554
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,519
crop steering but it's just you know

555
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,480
crop steering has been around for

556
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,679
decades in big a and it's and it's very

557
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,200
much just finding its way into cannabis

558
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,400
and we're I think we're finding the

559
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,000
boundaries of that very quickly right um

560
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,480
and obviously genetic to genetic is

561
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,960
different but when you're talking about

562
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,720
a genetic I'd say most genetics on a

563
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,640
medium run are about 2 and a half pounds

564
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,519
of light yeah you know a medium good run

565
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,360
where cultivators are happy there wer

566
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,400
weren't too many issues you're two and a

567
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:48,879
half right on a 4x4 yeah and without

568
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,960
under canopy steering and understanding

569
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,640
when to send those triggers to the plant

570
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,038
is very important and that's how you

571
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,000
kind of start breaching the consistency

572
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,798
of two and a half and into the threes

573
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,079
right genetic to

574
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:05,038
genetic with under canopy you're adding

575
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,639
light to your room well you're going to

576
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,240
have a little bit more yield that's I

577
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,720
mean light and yield are linear you know

578
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,839
this isn't that it's not so much rocket

579
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,278
sciencey there right it's what you do

580
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,918
with that extra yield that was really

581
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:23,200
tricky um if you're adding you know 140

582
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:26,880
watts to faven bars per 4x4 to a 4x4

583
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,200
that had a th000 watt HPS above it well

584
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
that's about 25%

585
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,240
extra light you're adding right there

586
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,798
well there's your 25% yield yeah okay so

587
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
there's your 25% yield I'm not saying

588
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:39,519
it's guaranteed but it's a pretty easy

589
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,798
equation to get

590
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,798
there on top of that now how do we get

591
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:50,440
past 25% well now we're looking at where

592
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:52,798
that light is that light is is is just

593
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,600
actioning a previously underutilized

594
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,599
area of your plant the bottom third of

595
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,879
your plant that bottom third of your

596
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:02,519
plant is good for

597
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,360
genetic to genetic but that that's good

598
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:09,759
for a yield increase and then really

599
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:11,798
where under canopy shines is when you

600
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,240
can and this is the the overarching goal

601
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,639
of underc canopy in general is getting

602
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,558
the perfect mix of top and bottom light

603
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,559
in the center of your plant because the

604
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,158
center of your plant holds the highest

605
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:26,639
yield potential by far you know there's

606
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,159
so many nodes going on in there and so

607
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,679
many so much potential there that it

608
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,799
usually just gets overshadowed because

609
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,159
you deaf yes but it's hard to you know

610
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,720
HPS drops off real fast you know it's

611
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
not it's pretty common for me to walk

612
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,880
into a facility I'll do a walk through

613
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,558
and talk about faving with them and I'll

614
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,200
put a par meter in there and it's 250

615
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,319
yeah and I'm like man you can clone at

616
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,558
250 you know like your plants need more

617
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,519
if you expect them to do better so so

618
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:56,440
you know it it really comes down to

619
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:58,200
where the light is um and how well you

620
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,480
manage that light and the mix of the top

621
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,240
and bottom light I that's your those are

622
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
the two big keys so now things like

623
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,480
thinning when you're using an underc

624
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,120
canopy light how do you thin your

625
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,440
recommend thinning topping thinning

626
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,439
stuff like that are there tips and

627
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,759
tricks oh yes

628
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,120
and before I forget I want to make sure

629
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,558
we have a ton of resources on our

630
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,439
Instagram and our YouTube like we're

631
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:21,639
putting out as much educational content

632
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,240
as we can around this yeah just because

633
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,080
it is um it's scary for a cultivator to

634
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,960
kind of dip their toes into this and you

635
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,038
know a lot of us are are run run right

636
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,240
now we can't have a bad run you know

637
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,839
can't afford to so we want to make sure

638
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,599
that that Growers feel very comfortable

639
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,798
and they have a verse a very good first-

640
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,599
time experience with faven yeah um and

641
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:44,119
so when it comes to

642
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,158
pruning please stop under

643
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,839
clearing people still get our lights and

644
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,880
they still under clear stripping them

645
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,879
stop it stripping them please at least

646
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,440
the first run don't touch it please

647
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,760
please please just watch watch and see

648
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,720
and I guarantee you will not have a bad

649
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,440
run because of it so so reduce under

650
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,079
clearing stop under clearing but

651
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,440
reducing under clearing really is

652
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,960
allowing for all those node sites

653
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,480
underneath there to become something

654
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,079
things that we usually would throw away

655
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,319
are now going to be extra yield and

656
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,519
they're going to be mature and they're

657
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,200
going to be cracked out and they're

658
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,679
going to fit in your bag just like top

659
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,840
all the way all the way down to the soil

660
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,320
or so whatever substrate so and to be

661
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,918
specific good thanks for bringing that

662
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,558
up to be specific if you've got your

663
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,880
lights you know flush with your pot um

664
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,440
we like to say put the put the

665
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,960
favin the base of the faven flush with

666
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,840
the top of the container rock wool one

667
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,440
gallon

668
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,000
whatever that way you know for sure that

669
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,519
you're not blasting your substrate with

670
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,798
light because that's a waste we don't

671
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,079
want to do that um and then I have a

672
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,038
couple people who are like you know I

673
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:50,319
grow you know four to five foot plants

674
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,158
so I'm actually going to raise these up

675
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,439
a little higher and so if you raise them

676
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,000
up a little higher than that then go

677
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,038
ahead and under clear underneath where

678
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,759
that light isn't you know making it

679
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,000
that's you know again it's a lot common

680
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,919
sensey stuff that we've been doing right

681
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,079
you know um Common Sense isn't so common

682
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,320
I know I know well it's a common thing

683
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,960
that Growers do but yes yes but that's

684
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,038
why we put out all the resources because

685
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,440
I was like oh this is a no-brainer

686
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:16,158
because I've been using it for four

687
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,159
years right I kind of forget how scary

688
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,320
it is to like introduce a new technology

689
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,840
like this right it as a grower you're

690
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,278
like yeah I'm not ready for that I've

691
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,879
got a lot on my plate right so we're

692
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,038
just trying to make it very easy and

693
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,720
approachable so reducing under clearing

694
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,519
which also reduces labor we can talk

695
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,440
about Labor savings later but reducing

696
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:39,158
that labor is really nice strategic de

697
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,919
Leaf right and really again making sure

698
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,440
you're getting upward mobility of that

699
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,480
light is key so usually I tell people

700
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,399
days three to five do a light light de

701
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,120
Leaf remove any of the little the little

702
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:52,038
sucker nodes at the bottom maybe there's

703
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,479
a weird one that kind of made it through

704
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:54,919
the cloning process and it's kind of

705
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,120
coming out of the soil like go ahead and

706
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,399
take that guy off too you know right

707
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,798
remove all the ones that aren't going to

708
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:04,639
be anything but leave the majority of

709
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:09,359
everything on on that day 3 to 5 little

710
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,759
light under Clear DE Leaf MH go back in

711
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:15,038
day between depends on who you talk to

712
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:16,200
18 to 25 there's a week there where

713
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,079
people like to get in there or they

714
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,399
don't day 21 yeah yeah it's the day 21

715
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,079
couple guys are like nah we don't touch

716
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:23,519
till 25 and some are like no we don't

717
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,439
care we're in there at day 14 you know

718
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,480
it just totally whatever you do yeah

719
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,080
totally and so you're really just going

720
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,599
in there pulling any of the huge fan

721
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,119
leaves that are really impeding the

722
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,639
upward mobility of the light you're

723
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,319
really just trying to keep it open in

724
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,919
there and make sure there's decent airf

725
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:41,879
flow right we just don't want it to be a

726
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,000
jungle underneath there um and so you

727
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,399
know you're really looking to do that

728
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,640
and then once you get to that point once

729
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,798
you get to day 25 end of week four call

730
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,640
it let just talk day 28 you kind of know

731
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,278
what's going to develop into a good butt

732
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,840
and what isn't you know you can kind of

733
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:58,278
see it because the hairs are maturing

734
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:00,119
and the butt is maturing at the same

735
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:02,798
same rate as the top they've been the

736
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:06,239
lights have been on for 28 days top and

737
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,038
bottom yeah you know so from there I

738
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,679
kind of let Growers take over and do

739
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,278
their own not let I don't let them I'm

740
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,640
like hey whatever your sop is you can

741
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:19,278
kind of continue from there you know and

742
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,799
I like to do a touchup around day 40 and

743
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,960
then a heavy strip for the last two

744
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,119
weeks we still do that I think it's a

745
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,759
great approach um but something that

746
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,519
comes up a lot when you're not under

747
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,440
clearing anymore is there's a lot of

748
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,639
congestion underneath in your under

749
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,600
canopy right mhm so what we I'm not

750
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,799
saying you have to do this again if

751
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:43,398
especially if you're on your first bench

752
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:45,319
of under canopy you're just trialing it

753
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,518
you don't have to do this but reducing

754
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:52,158
plant count is one of the biggest

755
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:55,159
benefits you can do to really prioritize

756
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,278
air flow in your under canopy and one of

757
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,720
the biggest benefits for yield increase

758
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,599
yeah like dropping plant count and

759
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,319
letting every plant really optimize

760
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,918
itself is is probably the biggest

761
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,439
takeaway we had from the first run at

762
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,759
Connected was just like we slam going

763
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,679
from like 16 to 9 going 16 to 12 going

764
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,158
yeah if you're four if your floor plants

765
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,038
wide you need to think about three

766
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,559
plants wide yeah you know even on a five

767
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:22,240
by bench it's just try it just try it if

768
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,918
you're on a four wide four foot wide

769
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,200
bench and you've got four plants wide

770
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,480
you definitely need to try just three

771
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,399
plants wide but yeah I like that nine

772
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,759
number 12 sometimes depending got some

773
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,719
biscotti sherb that doesn't like that

774
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,278
doesn't rage you know so that's a little

775
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,880
higher plant count man I love me some

776
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,079
Skittles Skittles with underc canopy

777
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,240
we'll tangent this is Skittles is so

778
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,960
much better of a plant with underc

779
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,200
canopy I bet it is just it is meant for

780
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,079
it it's lateral its branches are all

781
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,759
like this we talk about it a lot on this

782
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,158
show but yeah it's a struggler it's it's

783
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:57,200
but you see it with under canopy and

784
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,760
you're like oh my God this makes so much

785
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,880
sense just because it's built for it and

786
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,960
the nugs are already so light and lury

787
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,559
you know Smalls from Skittles is just

788
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,200
lar it's nothing it is it is and yeah

789
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,440
but you put some light underneath there

790
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,440
and tighten them up and Skittles is

791
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,240
commercially viable again yeah I get

792
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,440
some sticky Skittles nugs yeah yep oh

793
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,880
yeah and I bet you can get a little bit

794
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,360
of color in there too man oh just a

795
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,679
little bit but nobody wants any color

796
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,278
don't you don't you give me Skittles

797
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,038
with color people want color on

798
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,079
everything n if you if it's real

799
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,278
Skittles and it has a hint of color it's

800
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:32,558
good oh it's good yeah hint yeah but all

801

00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,519
a couple times a month and it'll just be

810
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,639
like I love faven bro I love the

811
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,519
Skittles he's yeah we're trying to get

812
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,880
them on the show next oh Adam and Paul

813
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,720
come on man get over here it's a quick

814
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,760
it's a quick little Drive yeah yeah but

815
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,319
yeah there's you know pruning

816
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:08,480
is pruning is so different cultivator to

817
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,839
cultivator and we we try to put out Sops

818
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,240
that are very

819
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,720
loose and malleable I guess you could

820
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,640
say grower to grower but you know what

821
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,079
we put out the content we put out we're

822
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
very comfortable with like hey if you

823
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,720
follow these steps within these steps

824
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
you will have success your first run

825
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,558
after your first run then start to tweak

826
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,039
it to your own right you know and I talk

827
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,240
to guys call me all the time and they're

828
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:31,319
like hey I'm going to try this and I'm

829
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,759
like go for it you just have to let me

830
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,240
know how it works like that's the deal

831
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,240
is you just have to let me know you know

832
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,159
cuz now I'm interested yeah um so and

833
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,880
and that's the thing but

834
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,720
really limit your under clearing like

835
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,000
all that is usable product you will be

836
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,120
shocked like g41 I got a um we've got

837
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,519
some double Stacks Amplified Farms has

838
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,079
uh they were help they helped us do our

839
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:57,759
double stack trials and uh we put g41 on

840
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,839
the top top level and I was like H you

841
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,359
know I I don't know how g41 is going to

842
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,398
do but this will be a good trial and oh

843
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,719
my goodness week five you were kind of

844
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:10,038
in there like that doesn't look like

845
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,558
much gosh I just um the fir by by week

846
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,638
eight you were like oh my God those are

847
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,278
golf balls you know it just it just set

848
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:18,599
on so late chunked out yeah and because

849
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,000
g41 is one of those where it doesn't

850
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,678
have the Super Active hairs yeah that

851
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,398
that like the bud grows into they're

852
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,360
those kind of squirmy hairs that stay

853
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,479
inside the bud but it just like kind of

854
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,359
swells together I don't know you know

855
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,839
but it doesn't look like much and then

856
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,519
oh my goodness I actually just left

857
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,199
there yesterday and they have g41 in the

858
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,120
same spot on the top deck and I was like

859
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,840
man I was kind of worried about this run

860
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:42,479
and head grower Zippy was like dude you

861
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:45,119
always worry about these runs and I'm

862
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,240
like yeah I know I know but they always

863
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:50,079
come through you know so the nested

864
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,558
bracks yes there you go nested we talked

865
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,480
about this the first time I was over

866
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,599
yeah

867
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,880
yeah good stuff yeah very much so but

868
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,558
yeah it's it's a whole new world it does

869
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,880
doesn't change your workflow too much

870
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,720
but I mean I have 700 life facilities in

871
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,120
Sacramento that have fully dropped their

872
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,079
third party labor because they don't

873
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,038
need them anymore there's no more under

874
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,240
clear weeks you know hey it costs a lot

875
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:13,599
of money it's labor is not cheap anymore

876
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,839
labor especially in

877
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:20,398
California finding good labor is the

878
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:24,439
hardest thing is oh my goodness but but

879
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,879
labor is also one of your biggest cogs

880
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,880
and you cannot get around it so anything

881
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,639
to lower even 10% labor in

882
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,519
taxes Damn Damn You California your

883
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:39,079
Silent Partner the

884
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,359
government but um but yeah man it's um

885
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,439
you know we're really just scratching

886
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,879
the surface we're really just and we

887
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,399
have a ton of things that we're

888
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,880
monitoring and watching and really

889
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,158
trying to put out some good content and

890
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,639
good resources you know nice it's so you

891
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,159
have a Spectra we have one light for HPS

892
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:55,719
and you have one light for Led yeah

893
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,200
really cool yeah just because they're

894
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,798
different light sources you know and

895
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,480
yeah no I think it's great you can put

896
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,240
light in either room you can put

897
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,839
Spectrum in either room but we really

898
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,919
did that to balance out quality so my

899
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,678
big uh interest with your lights is

900
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,360
going to be the seed production room so

901
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,559
we're going to do seed production we're

902
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:16,798
monitoring what you get with the faven

903
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,879
and what you get without and I really

904
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,759
like I'm I'm looking forward to seeing

905
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,600
bigger yields in seeds and I'm already

906
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:27,960
getting close to 50,000 seeds per light

907
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,158
and so if we can break that 50,000

908
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,278
threshold per light that's with auto

909
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,760
flowers but still that's still that's

910
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,200
that's great and if we can break that

911
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,079
50,000 seed threshold it's amazing I'm

912
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,120
super excited about that I'm and and

913
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,678
breeding was something that the uh you

914
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:44,119
know 20-year-old me when I got into

915
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,759
cannabis was like how how long does it

916
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:47,479
take to bring a genetic to Market two

917
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,759
years like no I don't have time for that

918
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,558
like you know a 60-day harvest is is too

919
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,839
long for me to wait anyway a minimum a

920
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,278
year to get something to marrow gosh man

921
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:58,638
and you're and and the Funky breeders

922
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,759
out there just kind of throwing seeds

923
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:02,240
around and packs around like not vetted

924
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,879
and stuff right like we're talking about

925
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,599
fully vetted genetics that have been

926
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,119
runed genetics yeah I mean there's a lot

927
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,039
of there's a lot of bad players in the

928
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,280
game these days but you know it it never

929
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,759
was interesting to me I just loved

930
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,079
growing yeah and so I never got into it

931
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,480
but you know you and a couple other

932
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,760
people have really kind of shined the

933
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,878
light on what seed production can be

934
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,599
with underc canopy and and your issue

935
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,679
being immature seeds lower yeah same

936
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,320
thing that you know Ro guys deal with

937
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,440
immature tricomes totally it's the same

938
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,599
idea well now you've become a solution

939
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,800
to a problem and that's

940
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,399
amazing inadvertently I was just trying

941
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,280
to put out a good product for Growers

942
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:42,440
and then people got it in their hands

943
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,960
and they were like hey you can do this

944
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,639
this and this with it and I think that's

945
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,760
the just the coolest part you know

946
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,878
that's the coolest part to me totally

947
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,079
yeah well so let's dive back into a

948
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:55,159
little bit of your history you know when

949
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,480
did you first start enjoying the plant I

950
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,838
wasn't a big smoker growing up

951
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,320
um I was the oldest of three boys kind

952
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,920
of a single mom situation and so I was

953
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,559
kind of setting the tone you know and I

954
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,760
um early on my grandpa kind of sat me

955
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,920
down and was like hey you're the man of

956
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,800
the house you need to kind of act like

957
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,760
it you know kind of thing like you know

958
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,880
so always kind of had to stay away from

959
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,079
that and set a good example um and then

960
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,440
I was soon as I could I was working you

961
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,359
know and um I play 16 18 15 and a half

962
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,320
you know as soon as I could soon as it

963
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,639
was

964
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,119
my first job when I was 12 working for

965
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,639
my parents yeah there you go there you

966
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,320
go you know and um and know I played

967
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:37,519
Sports I played soccer growing up I ran

968
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,440
track in high school you know I was

969
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,480
always doing stuff and so like you know

970
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,240
canvas was everywhere it's Kali and high

971
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,159
school and whatever you know literally

972
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:47,118
it's everywhere is everywhere but it

973
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:50,199
just like you know I think I hit a joint

974
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,760
at a party my junior year and like I

975
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,960
don't know I hit the joint I passed it

976
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,359
back and they were like you know people

977
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,000
were like oh Tim smoked you know but it

978
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,480
didn't do anything you know right um but

979
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,480
you know I didn't really get into it

980
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,719
until I think senior year I got high

981
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,440
after watching Harold and Kumar of

982
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,039
course you know after though people

983
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,559
think that's funny that I got high after

984
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,159
watching it it just seemed like so much

985
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,039
fun I was like I hit my buddy up and I

986
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,838
was like you know let's go right and um

987
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:21,920
so when I left High School um I went up

988
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:24,920
to Chico um and all my roommates there

989
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,200
smoked and it was like you might as well

990
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,559
and I think the second day I was in

991
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,679
Chico one of the like this local like

992

hung around the apartment complex

994
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,839
brought us a hash ball that was like

995
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,199
this almost the size of a tennis ball

996
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:42,519
and I had no idea what it was and then

997
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,439
he pulled out like a 20 gram nug like

998

with us you know like by the time moving

1039
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,400
day came like there was another you know

1040
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,118
there was a couple guys so um we got

1041
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,440
down there we all worked jobs we all

1042
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,119
went to college tried to do our best and

1043
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,838
man it was so expensive down there that

1044
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,160
we really were not making it like we

1045
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,759
were working full-time jobs everything

1046
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,960
and we just weren't making it wow and uh

1047
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,480
probably about 3 months in we had it was

1048
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,400
a two-bedroom apartment we had two guys

1049
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,800
in each bedroom our freaking mattresses

1050
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,160
basically touched you know what I mean

1051
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,599
like it was like you we were good homies

1052
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,279
by by the end of that year we had two

1053
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,720
guys in each bedroom one guy on the

1054
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,599
couch and then we had another guy move

1055
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,719
down and sleep on the couch and this guy

1056
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,079
moved down and he kind of saw the

1057
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:00,679
situation and he had always kind of side

1058
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,880
hustled in high school a little bit or

1059
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:04,598
after high school I think and he was

1060
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,559
like Hey you know there's a there's like

1061
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,160
a big price difference between you know

1062
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,759
the Bay Area packs and and down here in

1063
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,759
San Diego we're like no we don't we

1064
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,000
don't know man you know so um pretty

1065
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,440
quickly he had a good plug and um we

1066
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,159
were up in San Francisco scoring units

1067
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,519
and then we got introduced to vending we

1068
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,960
got introduced to vending and we started

1069
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:26,358
hitting the clubs and at that time it

1070
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,599
was like

1071
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:33,480
2011 want to say yeah and there

1072
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,480
was 7 800 clubs between San Diego and la

1073
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,079
oh I bet I me it well I mean I Wild West

1074
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,280
dude we sold a little bit here and there

1075
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,760
while we were on Camp we were actually

1076
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,000
living on the San Diego State campus but

1077
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,960
we weren't going to San Diego State it

1078
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,599
was blast and uh it's probably why we

1079
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,599
were broke um but you know uh somebody

1080
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,039
turned us on a vending and you know we

1081

1085
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,079

of it but you know um you know we

1089
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:21,679
developed a good reputation because we

1090
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:23,118
would show up on time you know the club

1091

1095
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,079
time for us yeah yet like that that came

1096
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:35,880
but you know we were you know it was

1097
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,880
crazy to us that you know we were making

1098
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,920
maybe 1,500 bucks you know each a month

1099
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,920
working our full-time jobs and we can

1100
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,559
move a few packs and and pretty much

1101
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,599
scrape that up in a in in a couple days

1102
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:51,078

gosh like we can live and we can like

1104
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,079
not that we had the business mindset

1105
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,720
like we can scale this but like we can

1106
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:01,039
do more you know yeah and so

1107
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:03,199
kind of a weird chain of events um we

1108
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,960

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,160
big clients within like two or three

1129
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:50,639
months of starting to vend like we had

1130
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,960
legitimate clients that were like hey if

1131
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,480
you don't show up with what you say like

1132
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,559
we're going to be we're gonna be mad

1133
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,318
we're not going to buy from you again

1134
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,480
you know so right so we started um there

1135
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:03,400
was like four of us and there was two of

1136
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,480
us would run you know run up and grab

1137
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,800
units and two of us would Hustle the

1138
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,440
clubs and collect money and distribute

1139
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:15,519
do whatever we needed to uh you know

1140
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:18,240
under the guys of 215 all 215 legit

1141
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:20,358
and so we did that and and once we had

1142
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,118
ingred on the menu we really exploded

1143
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:24,838
you know ingred once we had that that

1144
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,480
gave us all the Bubba that was coming

1145
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:28,078
out of the Coast all the You2 that was

1146
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,240
coming out of the coast all the Cherry

1147
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,720
AK that was coming out of the coast

1148
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,358
man lip smacking like you can't say

1149
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:38,000
Cherry AK without just salivating a

1150
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,519
little yeah you know so it really

1151
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
legitimized us and we didn't know what

1152
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:42,159
we were doing at the time but looking

1153
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,519
back on it that was a really big

1154
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,879
inflection point and so we did that for

1155
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,880
a while with them and then um couple

1156
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,920
months and then they started offering to

1157
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,400
like teach us how to grow and you know

1158
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,960
we're talking going to learn on the

1159
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,800
mesino coast like it was wow we were

1160
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,599
like indoor or indoor wow so we learned

1161
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,160
indoor first and homes that were blown

1162
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,800
up from the kitchen to the bathroom bro

1163
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:06,118
like every square foot you know clones

1164
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,039
in the bathroom totally moms in the in

1165
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,119
the kitchen you know everything else was

1166
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,318
flour and uh parabolic hoods and and

1167
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,640
rolling you know everything with tomato

1168
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:19,838
cages and on rolling uh rolling trays or

1169
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,799
uh little plant trays saucers yeah we we

1170
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,920
learned up there for a couple months man

1171
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,680
and um you know just just like

1172
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,880
everything and and I think early

1173
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,318
cannabis Partnerships were rough

1174
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,680
and um not with the angry guy just just

1175
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,519
the other people we were growing with

1176
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,279
and so pretty quickly we were like okay

1177
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,400
we need to Branch off on our own and and

1178
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,319
figure this out and so we kind of got

1179
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,680
the growing basics down a little bit we

1180
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:44,318
were actually growing veganic um we

1181
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:46,480
learned veganic first which was wild

1182
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:49,440
like Kyle kushman veganic like yeah like

1183
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,199
I learned from a direct friend of

1184
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,400
kushman in 2011 badass pretty cool yeah

1185
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,519
I didn't know what it meant at the time

1186
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,480
but looking back on I'm like that's

1187
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,559
pretty badass yeah yeah so yeah we

1188
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,960
actually ended up uh building an indoor

1189
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:06,040
in elderado County um we found a killer

1190

1192
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:13,960

1193
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,440

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,240
this little side door and there was a

1202
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,720
basement built into a side of a hill wow

1203
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,199
it was 1,200 square feet almost 12200

1204
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:39,318
square feet probably we ended up with

1205
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,879
probably a th000 square foot of

1206
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:45,039
cultivation space two rooms 20s

1207

house killing it yeah you know just

1209
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,440
living the dream like literally living

1210
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,119
the dream 30 minutes from Sarah Tahoe

1211
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,440
you know like we went you know all

1212
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,200
winter we snowboard anyway I'm getting a

1213
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,318
little ahead of myself but but that was

1214
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,199
like our first our first grow and we

1215
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:05,119
ended up actually we took that down in

1216
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:07,399
2019 that ran for eight years wow I know

1217
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,318
like that's great though lowkey yeah and

1218
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,318
yeah man we you know everything was

1219
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,679
great and then I think it I think it was

1220
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:20,719
the end of 2011 or mid 2011 the feds

1221
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:23,480
came in to LA and San Diego and ruined

1222
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:26,358
the party almost in like a week it

1223
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,920
seemed overnight and so we were kids we

1224
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:29,719
were oh want a pound here you go you

1225
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,280
want a couple pounds here you go they'll

1226
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:34,279
pay us they need more of our stuff you

1227
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,160
know they need us and you know we took a

1228
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:41,440
really big loss because I

1229
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:45,239
knew James at whatever Collective on the

1230
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,159
corner of wherever you know and that

1231
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:48,919
place disappeared and so did James you

1232
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:50,399
know and maybe he got seized but like we

1233
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,519
never heard from these people again he

1234
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,880
owed you money of course yeah know they

1235
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:57,519
had Consignment they had and but it was

1236
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,680
the it was a good lesson it was the big

1237
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,880
first L and Consignment kills people

1238
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,879
though like that's still to this day

1239
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,599
look what's going on now kill business

1240
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,160
yeah I mean it's rough it's rough and

1241
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,838
you know the whole term game that's

1242
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,399
going on now in 2024 is ridiculous it's

1243
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:14,239
just absolutely ridiculous I mean I've

1244
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,838
gone through it with seeds too just

1245
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:19,919
lesson after lesson I think I've learned

1246
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:22,558
my lesson but you just never know you

1247
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,000
never know you hope you do but yeah

1248
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,880
there's people that still owe me

1249
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,800
hundreds of thousands of seeds or money

1250
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,039
for those seeds yeah and uh yeah and

1251
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,680
then I I have another friend who just

1252
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:33,519
sent me after two years finally sent me

1253
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,159
my seeds back after hassling him for two

1254
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:37,358
years oh my goodness so not getting paid

1255
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:39,199
but at least I got my seeds back you got

1256
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,279
your seeds back I

1257
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,960
guess maybe maybe have you popped them

1258
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,599
well yeah we're doing germ tests right

1259
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,119
now on actually so we'll see they do

1260
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,119
feel a little

1261
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,838
light but yeah you know it was it was

1262
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,519
good but that was like our Turning Point

1263
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:56,920
from really understanding that we really

1264
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:58,079
wanted to be in the grower the grower

1265
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,838
position and

1266
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:05,680
honestly growing was something that like

1267
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:07,679
young Tim like 20 year-old 21y old Tim

1268
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,919
like really needed like I needed

1269
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:12,358
something to put like just to throw

1270
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,280
myself at and well it's something so

1271
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:18,679
regimen that you have to water them when

1272
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,319
they need water yeah you have to harvest

1273
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:22,118
when you have to harvest there's a lot

1274
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,599
of discipline required to grow good

1275
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,599
flower like at the end of the day

1276
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,318
there's a lot of discipline involved you

1277
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,039
know some some of these guys that you

1278
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:30,440
see out there they might be lazy in

1279
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,079
other aspects of their life but if they

1280
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,559
got fire it's because they had a lot of

1281
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,160
discipline and they did things right so

1282
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,760
it's not the plant doesn't grow itself

1283
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,879
yeah no it really doesn't yeah it's a

1284
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,760
weed it'll grow but but if you want good

1285
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,280
stuff especially now yeah I mean it's

1286
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,800
tough yeah but it was it was good

1287
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,400
because I needed to I needed something

1288
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,519
to kind of pour myself into and and you

1289
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,838
know the difference

1290
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,759
between you know taking the risk to grow

1291
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:00,199
cannabis and like working at working

1292
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,400
retail was you know you could kill it

1293
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:05,078
and an 8 hour shift at retail maybe get

1294
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,960
an hour of overtime in and feel good but

1295
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:08,160
you could

1296
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,960
spend that same amount of time in your

1297
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,558
grow room and your plants are

1298
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,920
exponentially better especially back

1299
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,920
then when you're handw watering and

1300
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,680
you're really paying attention to each

1301
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,280
PL you're going in right it's not it's

1302
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,440
way less of a production right you get

1303
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,559
that LoveHate relationship with the

1304
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,920
handw yeah I still you know I still

1305
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,240
start him off with a handw waterer

1306
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,318
though I still handw waterer my outdoor

1307
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,239
plants my back

1308
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:31,279
okay I still enjoy waking up in the

1309
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,959
morning you know and hitting them

1310
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,920
checking the plants out I feel like it

1311
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,358
gets me right in the head yeah more

1312
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,880
therapy than uh yeah that's cool that's

1313

1314
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,519
have to do that I can't do anything in

1315
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,079
the backyard I got a two-year-old right

1316
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,519
now and he's curious about everything so

1317
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,280

00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,318
pulling branches whatever oh dude he

1319

fine but but anyway yeah it's you know

1327
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:11,318
it it it was really really cool that you

1328
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,039
know we had the opportunity to learn

1329
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:16,079
from who we learned from and you know

1330
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,558
find our own path in it because after

1331
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,440
that we really became Growers like we

1332
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:21,640
always had Outlets because that's you

1333
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,639
know you had to have a secure Outlet

1334
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:26,000
back then and cuz you couldn't just roll

1335
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:28,598
up to the grow and fill up your your

1336
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,519
Yukon with packs like you had to know

1337
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:32,880
somebody who knew somebody it was much

1338

1348
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,119
back in the traditional Market we you

1349
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,798
did have to wear a lot of hats a lot of

1350
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:00,119
times you were doing your own extraction

1351
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:01,559

1366
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:37,519
the plant and really I think the the

1367
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:40,159
lifestyle it afforded was so cool too I

1368

mean we just chased snow all winter yeah

1369
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:45,118

1370
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:47,159
built that indoor we got outdoor

1371
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,559
capabilities in Willets great growing

1372
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,440
climbing in Willets good place to grow

1373
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:52,960
just cool enough at night real real hot

1374
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,400
during the day but just cool enough

1375
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,838
during the night to really pull some

1376
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,200
tpin man just they've been growing fire

1377
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:03,318
out of there for years long time long

1378
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:06,519
before me yeah but uh we we rolled the

1379
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:08,798
dice big man you know we were um we got

1380
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:11,199
a property it had a we called it the

1381
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:13,679
plywood Palace it was a three-story

1382
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:16,039
plywood building that had indoor

1383
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:19,039
capabilities nice which it was not

1384
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,798
insulated it had nothing in it so we

1385
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,358
outfitted it that was when the uh the

1386
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:25,000
trip XXL Raptor hoods were big oh yeah

1387
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:28,440
so yeah so we were we were putting those

1388
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,639
up the the ballast that were like 80 lbs

1389
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,119
like those things would rip your

1390
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:32,759
freaking arm out of your socket if you

1391
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,920
grabbed it the wrong way you know like

1392
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,200
those I think they were the Miami

1393
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,960
ballast I don't even know why they were

1394
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,960
in Miami but someone needs to have a

1395
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,318
light museum for all the old stuff I

1396
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,199
would go D I would totally go too I mean

1397
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:45,119
that's a great idea how cool would that

1398
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,719
be that would be that would be awesome

1399
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,920
see some a a collective effort from all

1400
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:51,798
of the companies because everybody's had

1401
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,119
their you know contributions and I feel

1402
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:54,838
like everybody has their place that's

1403
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,640
created so funny you say that that's a

1404
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:59,440
great idea I mean I love the adjust

1405
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,279
wings I did the oh I know the a wings

1406
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,358
were killer yeah and then there was like

1407
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,040
the air cooled lights we had the first

1408
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,239
it was like the 4 in and then it like

1409
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,079
the upgrade was the 6 in air cool bites

1410
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:11,358
and we had cool tubes I mean there was

1411
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:14,280
so many things back in the day that do

1412
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,838
not see anymore it's and good cuz gosh

1413

00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,279
those

1415
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,400
freaking the fungus knats that would

1416
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,079
crawl up there and die by the Thousand

1417
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,639

00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:29,719
and Willets and um we put out you know

1446
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,639
99 circles we did our thing and you know

1447
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:34,558
had to go up this crazy switch back you

1448
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,480
know to get up to the top of the plywood

1449
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,599
Palace and so we were I mean we were we

1450
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,719
were roughing it and there was about six

1451
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,039
of us just boat

1452
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:46,239
strapping yeah just doing whatever we

1453
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,159
could you know we didn't have irrigation

1454
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,279
we didn't know how to irrigate 99 you

1455
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,879
know 300 gallon pots like so we were we

1456
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,280
were carrying five gallon buckets back

1457
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,039
and forth every day watering those

1458
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,000
things you know we all had we all had

1459
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:59,880
traps up to our ears you know we were

1460
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
just yoked from you know chest up you

1461
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,480
know but you know we did what we had to

1462
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,318
do and we had the indoor and and um ELO

1463
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,798
going and you know we kept it going we

1464
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,440
turned on the indoor for a couple weeks

1465
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:14,358
we had a

1466
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,798
70 kilowatt whisper W generator didn't

1467
00:54:14,358 --> 00:54:17,519
know what we were doing with a generator

1468
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:19,759
of course you had to have a g generator

1469
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,639
mechanic and do refills and we were just

1470
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,400
a bunch of kids we had no idea so we

1471
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:25,598
spent I don't even know how many tens of

1472
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,639
thousands of dollars to build out an

1473
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,798
indoor inside and then it became very

1474
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:33,639
unfeasible for us to do it um so we

1475
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:36,039
turned our focus on outdoor to kind of

1476
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:40,039
recuperate all of what we had thrown in

1477
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:43,519
and uh August uh fed showed up and cut

1478
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:44,838
us down oh [ __ ] yep and they went in and

1479
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:46,318
their favorite thing to do is go into

1480
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:49,440
your equipment and cut all the cords you

1481
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,960
know oh they cut they cut all the cords

1482
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,679
they cut it you know they did the whole

1483
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,599
n they field day oh they love it but you

1484
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,598
know what crazy is we really do believe

1485
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,039
to this day they let us leave and then

1486
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,880
went and cut everything down because

1487
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,480
back then they got paid by how many

1488
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,119
plants they cut down and not matter how

1489
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,440
many arrests they made they didn't care

1490
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:06,880
about arresting you they just wanted to

1491
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,599
cut it down that was the cool part about

1492
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,160
the Cali like traditional Market is like

1493
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,640
unless you were messed around with BHO

1494
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:14,039
like they probably weren't arresting you

1495
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,519
you know unless you were transporting

1496
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:17,920
hundreds of pounds like they probably

1497
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:20,079
weren't arresting you you know yeah just

1498
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,519
especially up there I mean the thing is

1499
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:26,039
the community revolved around cannabis

1500
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,280
so if you had a kid in school other

1501
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:29,520
parents parents were involved with

1502
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,519
cannabis it touched everybody right

1503
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,920
especially you know the Emerald

1504
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:37,440
Triangle everyone's livelihood revolved

1505
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,240
around it so if you owned a shop you

1506
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,798
know people that were buying stuff from

1507
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:46,159
your shop were involved in cannabis so

1508
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,440
it normalized it way way earlier than it

1509
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,159
did all around the rest of the United

1510
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,639
States because it's fairly normalized

1511
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:53,239
right I feel like we're good overall you

1512
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,598
know over 50% of the people like

1513
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:58,639
cannabis but yeah you know I mean over

1514
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,960
50% of people don't like you know

1515
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,679
whatever peanut butter yeah you know I

1516
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,639
mean so what not peanut is not a good

1517
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:07,480
example but there's so many tomato

1518
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:09,480
tomatoes are 50/50 with people man I

1519
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,760
swear I love them give me some heirlooms

1520
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,318
please so I think we're doing really

1521
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,440
good and I think we made a lot of

1522
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:15,920
progress yeah we definitely have and

1523
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,440
it's nice to see I think I saw a

1524
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,798
statistic the other day that was like

1525
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,559
based on like population like if you

1526
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,400
just look at population and urban

1527
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,599
centers like more than 90% of the United

1528
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,760
States population wise has has access to

1529
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,880
Legal cannabis yeah you know and I think

1530
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,319
it's like almost 40 States now are you

1531
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,599
know Med or wreck right it's it's coming

1532
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,798
like you know but but yeah you're right

1533
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:42,359
it it was so regular up there and you

1534
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:43,400
know we still nobody could be like now I

1535
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:44,880
feel like you could walk down the street

1536
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,400
with a plant in your hand and like

1537
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,358
people would be like cool bro like what

1538
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,838
are you doing yeah you couldn't do that

1539
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:54,719
back then but like you know it was it

1540
00:56:50,838 --> 00:56:57,279
was just regular day you know and um you

1541
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:59,318
know we got when we got hit it was it

1542
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,039
was pretty gnarly and uh it freaked us

1543
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:03,159
out a lot you know we were kids we

1544
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,039
thought law enforcement had their stuff

1545
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:05,798
together a little more than law

1546
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:07,119
enforcement probably did you know so we

1547
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:10,038
thought they were kind of on to us you

1548
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,358
know right and uh a couple of the a

1549
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:12,119
couple of the guys went and like kind of

1550
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:14,920
hit

1551
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:17,318
out um we have a cool campsite to this

1552
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,440
day that's still pretty remote um those

1553
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:21,279
are the Eldorado County you know and

1554
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,079
yeah real real sneaky spot or you can

1555
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,359
get back into town in about 25 minutes

1556
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:27,160
get your supplies and get back up the

1557
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:31,038
hill you know so real real good SP

1558
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:32,440
and uh almost simultaneously our spot

1559
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,039
that we were kind of we were still you

1560
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,760
know we were still working the San Diego

1561
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:39,440
La Market almost simultaneously that got

1562
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:42,720
hit so it really put us on high alert it

1563
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,318
was a complete coincidence but y you

1564
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:47,719
know the day it happened we were like oh

1565
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:50,480
my God we're tapped you know like you

1566
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:54,318
know you just your mind starts going but

1567
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,920
um couple of us stayed up there hit our

1568
00:57:54,318 --> 00:58:00,239
clone guy on the coast and replanted

1569
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,798
through Days Later wow yeah and back in

1570
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,719
the day you know it was you know it was

1571
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,280
early August so we kind of babied him we

1572
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,239
hardened him off to the sun made sure

1573
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,798
everything was fine but you know we

1574
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,399
replanted everything that this guy

1575
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:13,559
didn't need for a clone order you know

1576
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,200
we we we drove I don't know how many

1577
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,880
trips back and forth from the coast you

1578
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:20,038
know to Willets on the sketchy ass 20

1579
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,200
and put everything in the ground and we

1580
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,599
pretty much broke even for the year yeah

1581
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:26,480
you know monetary wise which was just

1582
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:28,318
insane can't do that now better than

1583
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,599
losing oh yeah it's better than losing

1584
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:31,480
and a lot of lessons dude there was a

1585
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,318
lot of lessons that it didn't cost too

1586
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,880
much right so a lot of Sweat Equity but

1587
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,920
we're 22 man we didn't care like swe was

1588
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,760
was all we had nobody died nobody went

1589
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:44,358
to jail and you broke even I mean those

1590
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,799
are life got a freaking a ride up man

1591
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:47,318
like we didn't even get a ticket you

1592
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:49,358
know like we didn't get anything so we

1593
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:52,239
we felt pretty lucky but yeah but that

1594
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:54,358
kind of closed the chapter on the group

1595
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,639
that we had kind of assembled all the

1596
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:58,119
guys that were with us like there were

1597
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:00,400
six or seven Us by that time and we had

1598
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:02,318
our hopes on really hitting it big and

1599
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,079
getting more properties for people and

1600
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:05,880
and keep expanding like we had all these

1601
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,920
Grand you know I was going to buy this

1602
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,559
truck and you know like fit in with the

1603
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,960
broozers going around meno you know but

1604
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:16,280
it really was kind of the it was the end

1605
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,920
of that era for us and it's it it's

1606
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,839
really great to look back on those few

1607
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,960
years because it was so raw and it was

1608
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:24,239
really a family yeah you know it was

1609
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,920
your family is what who we who we did

1610
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,199
everything with and um you know you lose

1611
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,920
together and you win together you break

1612
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:31,519
bread together like it's a it's a bond

1613
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,119
that never can be really broken and

1614
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,358
those are the best kind of relationships

1615
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,838
they're awesome and you know a couple

1616
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:38,480
guys were like yeah cannabis isn't for

1617
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:41,400
me I was doing it because I was hoping

1618
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,280
to you know fund my whatever whatever

1619
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,200

1622
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:54,000
our own ways and ended up back in El

1623
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:56,279
Dorado and um I ended up getting some

1624
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,920
outdoor capabilities in El Dorado the

1625
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,680

1626
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,960
dude like if I had an indoor run that

1627
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:07,159
was like if I don't hit this I have no

1628
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,358
money to run outdoor so I need to get

1633
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:18,440

1636
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,000
took to be able to have the money to run

1637

01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,719
pretty much man yeah what actually ended

1656
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:14,199
up what what really not only getting

1657
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:15,759
burnt out on legalization came you know

1658
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:17,279
a couple years after like I had a few

1659
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,880
good years legalization came things got

1660
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,640
weird right yeah legalization was scary

1661
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,920
it's been going up and down since like

1662
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:29,519
2017 heavy 2017 somebody came in and

1663
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,200
offered me like 1,200 bucks for my

1664
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,559
freaking sfv or my sherb or something

1665
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:36,919
and I was like this is ridiculous I'm

1666
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:39,720
out of here you know like I'm not doing

1667
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:41,200
this and so I actually started to um

1668
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:43,719
kind of get my college credits back in

1669
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,279
line and so I got my credits back in

1670
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:47,759
line I actually went to Lake Tahoe

1671
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,400
Junior College uh there in South Lake

1672
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,799
and got everything back in line and by

1673
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,680
2018 I was ready to kind of leave

1674
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:55,599
cannabis I was really burnt out

1675
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:58,199
legalization was weird people were legal

1676
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:01,200
but still getting raided like it was

1677
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:04,000
just such a confusing time so weird yeah

1678
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,318
and I didn't have the attorney and yeah

1679
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,079
I could have figured it out but you just

1680
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,599
heard about the millions being poured in

1681
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,640
and I was like well I don't have that

1682
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:16,079
Canada coming into the US yeah you heard

1683
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:18,358
just all the crazy stuff so I actually

1684
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,039
just like I thought I had retired yeah

1685
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:22,719
you know and I went back to school um

1686
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,240
was lucky enough to get into UC Davis

1687
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,838
and uh the College of a there and

1688
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:28,159
started playing around with some pretty

1689
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:31,159
cool stuff and that's actually where I

1690
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:34,278
was introduced to LEDs yeah yeah so I

1691
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:37,920
hated LEDs back in the day the purple

1692
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:40,159
LED SPC it was always blurle man GH I

1693
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,559
couldn't do it and and the guys every

1694
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:45,480
every single guy that tried to sell me

1695
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,319
on the purple LEDs they grew like [ __ ]

1696
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,199
and so I'm like there's no way they were

1697
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:51,199
also like 30 Watts like the ones you

1698
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,798
dropped into the canopy yeah there was

1699
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:56,078
like no intensity to them garbage yeah

1700
01:02:53,798 --> 01:02:59,440
totally and so Auto flowers back in the

1701
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,318
day and the purple LEDs I I was like I

1702
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,240
said I wrote those off for for the rest

1703
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:06,079
of my life and it took a lot you know

1704
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,278
same thing with Co Coco Coco is another

1705
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,318
one cuz we had the blocks of Coco and we

1706
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:12,079
had to break them up and I hated that so

1707
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,960
I was like I'm never using Coco but now

1708
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,760
I use coco I was prox till I die I use

1709
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,599
everything I I like all the substrates

1710
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,520
for different reasons you know for rock

1711
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,039
rock wool's grape for certain things

1712
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:24,559

1713
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,720
cocoa fan yeah I'm a but soil I love

soil too yeah I know same same and I

1715
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,838
think the the right application right it

1716
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:35,119
was cool man I you know I went back to

1717
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:37,278
school the the craziest thing was was

1718
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,400
like I didn't have Wi-Fi you know all

1719
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:42,119
those years in the Hills growing so I

1720
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:44,920
stepped into like middle of Davis and I

1721
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:46,240
got these kids that are brilliant CU you

1722
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,599
transfer into to Davis you don't have to

1723
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,239
be as brilliant I'm G be straight up

1724
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:52,079
with you you trans you come from high

1725
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:53,558
school you're top of your class wow

1726
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,559
different I was not top of my class in

1727
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:58,119
high school not even close you know um I

1728
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,319
only transferred in because they were

1729
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:04,519
like hey like there's a guarantee from

1730
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:06,000
South Lake JC to UC Davis wow like hey

1731
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:07,079
sign up for this do all these things

1732
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,199
boom boom boom and you're almost

1733
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:10,720
guaranteed as long as you have a good

1734
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:13,278
GPA and you meet the requirements and so

1735
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,598
I it's called a tag I transferred in and

1736
01:04:13,278 --> 01:04:17,440
then I always try to make a point to say

1737
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:20,278
it when I when I have a a public um

1738
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,079
platform but I didn't pay to go back to

1739
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:25,838
college if you're over the age of 24 or

1740
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:27,920
25 and I think it's still going on uh

1741
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:30,318
for a lot of the UC system if you're

1742
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,559
over the age 24 25 you make a less than

1743
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:33,519
a certain amount of money then it was

1744
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,599
like $80,000 like if you make less than

1745
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:38,599
$80,000 on paper they'll pay for your

1746
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:40,039
education and so I actually didn't come

1747
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:41,680
out of pocket at Dime like I had to live

1748
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:43,799
in a very expensive city which is Davis

1749
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,358
is very expensive yeah and all my food

1750
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:47,719
and stuff like that and all my books and

1751
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:49,239
stuff but I didn't pay for my education

1752
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:51,598
Davis is a great school if you want to

1753
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:53,159
learn about cannabis not just smoking

1754
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,880
but but actually agriculture it's a

1755
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:59,199
great AD school yeah and and what was

1756
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:02,119
really cool is um I think my second

1757
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:05,199
quarter there there was a zero net

1758
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:06,640
energy like elective and it was a

1759
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:07,838
master's elective so I was in there with

1760
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,920
a bunch of Master's kids and I was

1761
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:13,078
getting my undergrad my bachelor's

1762
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,200
and there's these there's these things

1763
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,359
called growth Chambers do you know what

1764
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:20,519
growth Chambers are you ever heard of

1765
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:22,639
these maybe maybe once I so just imagine

1766
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:24,679
the size of a refrigerator yeah okay and

1767
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:27,118
it's a grow room that fits inside of a

1768
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:30,480
refrigerator yeah it's got temp control

1769
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:33,278
humidity control lighting yeah so was

1770
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,599
like once I once I explain so and

1771
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:37,599
they're actually pretty expensive

1772
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:39,400
they're like 40 Grand right so anyway

1773
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,119
Davis obviously being the a research

1774
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,559
school they are they have like 200 of

1775
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,640
these below like one of the science

1776
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,640
buildings and each one of these things

1777
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,400
is rented by a professor who's doing

1778
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:49,920
some kind of trial yeah and once they

1779
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,039
trial there then they can take it to the

1780
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,159
outdoor plots you know in wherever

1781
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,160
there's you know Davis has acres and

1782
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:59,719
acres and

1783
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,440
ACR and so the school is looking at

1784
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:03,278
still is trying to figure out how to get

1785
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,278
to zero net energy right everybody's on

1786
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:09,440
the carbon neutral path right now and

1787
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:12,278
was in 2022 or 2020 as well

1788
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,880
um and they were all using HID lights in

1789
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:16,760
these little boxes right and these

1790
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,838
little refrigerators they're just

1791
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,278
blasting metal highlight or HPS or both

1792
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:23,000
they had the Dual ended with different

1793
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:25,920
with you know the the opposite bulb

1794
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,199
those are cool right um so actually the

1795
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:31,920
project I was on was retrofitting those

1796
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:34,598
with LEDs oh wow and so it's so funny

1797
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,760
that I got put in that class in that

1798
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:39,480
program because I had all this knowledge

1799
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,880
of like HID lighting right and so all

1800
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,400
these kids with me who were Master's

1801
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,680
kids really brilliant just brilliant

1802
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,798
kids I was like running the show because

1803
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:50,639
I'm like oh no we

1804
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:53,719
need it like it was just so it's so

1805
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:56,038
funny how it worked out um but yeah so

1806
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:58,759
we actually had to you know figure it

1807
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,440
out over like a couple months figure out

1808
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,278
the the payback you know how long it's

1809
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:06,278
going to take for the payback of like

1810
01:07:03,278 --> 01:07:08,159
you know Energy savings and um the cost

1811
01:07:06,278 --> 01:07:10,318
of the lights and which ones the gr

1812
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,278
which ones the professors need and to to

1813
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,798
make sure their research is

1814
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:16,440
uninterrupted and yada Y and it was so

1815
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:18,679
cool man and so we actually had a big

1816
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,000
presentation for a lot of like higher

1817
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:23,159
ups at UC Davis and this is me like six

1818
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,559
months into going back to college like

1819
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:26,399
you know just winging it but it was

1820
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:28,960
really cool that was my first

1821
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,720
introduction to LEDs and and dodes and

1822
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,480
understanding um efficacy and just like

1823
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:35,639
all the little things right and and

1824
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,240
spectrum and you know and there was a

1825
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:39,960
couple big players at the time but it

1826
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:43,479
was still in his infant stages in you

1827
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,318
know early 21 know so the adoption

1828
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,639
adoption was on its way but it wasn't as

1829
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:49,719
flushed out as it is now you know no not

1830
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:52,598
even close not even close everybody was

1831
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:55,719
still running blur yeah that a people

1832
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:58,640
are going to go blind in HPS yeah yes

1833
01:07:55,719 --> 01:08:00,639
seriously but anyway now California HPS

1834
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:04,440
are going to going away according to our

1835
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:06,719
governor I we'll see I what's what's

1836
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,920
your thought on that there's no way it

1837
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:11,919
doesn't go away like it just has to I

1838
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,838
just if I mean dude they're trying to

1839
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,880
limit gas power generators around here

1840
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:18,880
you know like those are worth they

1841
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,480
waiting gold right now in California

1842
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,159
like it's just ridiculous and I

1843
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,439
understand the indoor like it's

1844
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,158
extremely energy intensive right we

1845
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:30,559
really should be growing in in green

1846
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:33,599
houses right mix light it's the perfect

1847
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:36,560
world yeah it is yeah and you can get an

1848
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,400
amazing product I think people don't

1849
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,120
agree sometimes because they don't know

1850
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,879
yeah it's the lack of Education yeah

1851
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:43,880
it's the lack of Education because that

1852
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,920
is the perfect world growing green maybe

1853
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:47,279
with supplemental Lighting in a

1854
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,640
greenhous that is the the key because

1855
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,279
you're getting the the natural light

1856
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:54,079
from the sun save you a little money

1857
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,920
lower your cogs exactly put some under

1858
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,920
canopy oh man the greenhouse under

1859
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,798
canopy is wild so

1860
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,480
honestly my biggest interest with under

1861
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:06,519
canopy when when I listen to you lecture

1862
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:08,559
was the greenhouse application because I

1863
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:11,199
feel like that's where so much product

1864
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:14,120
gets wasted more than anywhere else is

1865
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:17,479
the greenhouse that has the ly stuff

1866
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:19,759
below and now if you can correct that

1867
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:21,519
now you got a really amazing product

1868
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,198
game changer for a lot of people you get

1869
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,679
bigger yields you make more money and

1870
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:28,559
everything everyone's struggling right

1871
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,759
now so anything to increase that margin

1872
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,199
for Growers so they can keep operating

1873
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:35,039
and take care of their people you know I

1874
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,519
kind of take people catch people off

1875
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:37,920
guard when I say this but Greenhouse is

1876
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,040
actually a better application for under

1877
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,880
canopy than indoor yeah indoor is so

1878
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:43,759
sufficiently lit that like yeah there's

1879
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,960
potential yield potential like for sure

1880
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:48,719
you know like just about everybody we

1881
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:51,679
know first-time users fav in 25 to 35%

1882
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:54,800
like I'll stand by that number it's it's

1883
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,560
pretty much there right now when you're

1884
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,480
talking

1885
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,280
Greenhouse you're at the mercy of the

1886
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:03,279
sun you're at the mercy of the weather

1887
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:05,759
yeah you know you have some bad days you

1888
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:07,039
know and and we talk winter runs a lot

1889
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,400
of people shut it down for winter

1890
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,158
because their par readings are 250 300

1891
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:13,719
at canopy you can't you're not it's just

1892
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:17,039
not worth it so we actually had a lot of

1893
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:22,480
Trials over this past winter um

1894
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:24,479
and the results are mind-boggling um

1895
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:27,198
couple people were really close to 100%

1896
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:30,559
increase compared to Winter runs prior

1897
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:32,719
and that's awesome the quality was

1898
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,000
everything went over a thousand yeah

1899
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,679
went over for a thousand everything

1900
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,920
because it had the Spectrum was there

1901
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,319
right we were we were siding with our

1902
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,760
more red spectrum because the sun's

1903
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,439
going to give you the full spec so let's

1904
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,000
side on what the plant benefits from

1905
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:47,238
most well that's the you know the red

1906
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,359
side of thing you know so we went with

1907
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:53,279
that and really not only is the yield

1908
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,479
increase just absolutely ridiculous

1909
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,119
because you're dealing with such low DL

1910
01:10:55,479 --> 01:10:59,718
Li that the plants are actually

1911
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:02,359
struggling but the proximity of the

1912
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:05,359
lighting like we're we're delivering

1913
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:07,679
Coast close canopy lighting yeah to

1914
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,880
these plants where and and that's really

1915
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,119
the struggle even even the mix light

1916
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:15,400
facilities I mean you're hoping to get

1917
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:17,679
to 600 right you know par canopy you're

1918
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:20,439
hoping if you can push 700 750 and

1919
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:23,719
you're greeny you're on but you know if

1920
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:26,079
you can do 5 to 600 at top and you know

1921
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:27,880
500 in the middle and

1922
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:30,479
you know or higher than that in the

1923
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:34,039
Middle with under canop but you can push

1924
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:36,519
it in the middle there I mean sky is the

1925
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:38,880
limit really yeah and you want to talk

1926
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:41,800
about lowering planting densities that's

1927
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,520
a big one right that's a huge like the

1928
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,000
amount of plants that green houses deal

1929
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,199
with like if you can lower your plant

1930
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,760
count 10% yeah we're talking thousands

1931
01:11:48,198 --> 01:11:53,198
of plants you know yeah and so and the

1932
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,400
workability around faven too right we at

1933
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:57,238
277 you can run 20 of these in a daisy

1934
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:02,279
chain you know so you can run full

1935
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:05,198
benches on 277 volt all the way down and

1936
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:08,880
deliver so much light to these plants

1937
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:11,479
yeah um and Greenhouse is really really

1938
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,000
where my heart is like I love indoor I

1939
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:15,119
love how controlled it is and we're

1940
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,679
still at the mercy of our hvx for sure

1941
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:20,079
and dhomes for sure and irrigation

1942
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,639
somebody unplugged the you know the pump

1943
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,479
whatever but Greenhouse is really the

1944
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:26,960
art right in the cultivation space it's

1945
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:28,678
understanding your microclimate outside

1946
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,439
your greeny and inside you're greeny

1947
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:33,440
yeah and so to me guys like you know the

1948
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:35,000
tur Mansion guys up in Humble just

1949
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:37,599
killing it you know Dave Paulie

1950
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,359
preferred Gardens like killing it

1951
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,520
absolute Beast you know wish him well in

1952
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:44,479
his new 40,000 sare foot project out

1953
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,960
there and YOLO he's absolutely killing

1954
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:49,399
it the guy's guy's awesome yeah but you

1955
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,399
know it's such a tough go in green

1956
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:52,839
houses right now because there isn't

1957
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:55,638
that much of a difference in price

1958
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:57,679
between outdoor and indoor is so cheap

1959
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:59,440
that people a lot of times buyers will

1960
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,440
just go get indoor because they can get

1961
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:03,879
indoor for almost you know for a couple

1962
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:06,519
points more you know it doesn't make

1963
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:09,440
sense so that yield has to be there in

1964
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,080
the Greenies so really like that

1965
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:13,079
application of under canip liting greenh

1966
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:15,600
houses is the absolute best in my

1967
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:17,439
opinion yeah me too yeah it's just

1968
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,120
ridiculous they're meant for each other

1969
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:21,198
they are yes yes very much so but I'm

1970
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:22,840
really looking forward we have a lot of

1971
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:24,599
cool Partnerships coming up that and

1972
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,480
people who have trials right now that I

1973
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,520
I really want to to discuss yet but

1974
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,759
you'll be seeing it very soon but people

1975
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:33,520
are people are geeking on these things

1976
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,920
in in in green houses man they're

1977
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,400
they're having a lot of fun let's just

1978
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,119
let's just say that really yeah it's a

1979
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:39,479
it's a great application for it's just

1980
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:41,880
perfect yeah doesn't matter how you grow

1981
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:44,279
it too me you could be soil you could be

1982
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,639
you know you could be organic doesn't

1983
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:47,158
matter man you put them in the

1984
01:13:45,639 --> 01:13:49,119
greenhouse you're going to you're going

1985
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:53,039
to see a much greater yield potential

1986
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:54,599
increase than indoor because yeah yeah

1987
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:58,319
you're going to get more resin

1988
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:00,960
production oh yeah you're G to get botom

1989
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:02,079
yeah so so many benefits so many yeah so

1990
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,639
that's that's what I'm excited about

1991
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,920
more than anything I mean yeah the seed

1992
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:09,239
stuff all that stuff but like I really

1993
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,359
see the across the industry that's where

1994
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:12,839
I think there it's goingon to have the

1995
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:16,359
most impact yeah agreed and should we

1996
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:18,400
all be cultivating green houses yes y

1997
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:21,359
yes we should not be growing indoors we

1998
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:24,679
shouldn't be but you know I'll enjoy it

1999
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:26,759
while it last you know I mean yeah it's

2000
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:29,359
it's scale yeah I mean that's why they

2001
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,280
have these 100 Acre green houses coming

2002
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:32,759
online and stuff like that yeah yeah

2003
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:36,158
well and if you go to like Holland and

2004
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:38,679
look at like the the Dutch green houses

2005
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:41,158
dude the ven oh man you want to know

2006
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:42,960
like where this all is going it's there

2007
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:45,759
like let's be honest so for sure but

2008
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,279
yeah it's the greenhouse application is

2009
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,520
it's what I'm most excited about too and

2010
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:51,639
it's just something about looking at a

2011
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,120
plant inside a greenhouse like it's just

2012
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:55,000
something so natural about it and so

2013
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:56,559
beautiful and right I feel like in

2014
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,198
indoor they still have that beautiful

2015
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,400
green but outdoor in a greenhouse that

2016
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:04,759
emerald green is just

2017
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:06,839
so rich yeah that color is just in

2018
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,600
between the look of the outdoor to the

2019
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:10,760
indoor but you can get an indoor looking

2020
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,800
product that has the crystals the

2021
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:15,079
structure the density you know I think

2022
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,520
those things are important to people

2023
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:18,600
that visual where like not not that

2024
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,840
there's anything wrong with outdoor

2025
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,320
because I I love Amazing Outdoor you

2026
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:26,199
know if you do outdoor right killer it's

2027
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:28,119
the best ker but typically for the

2028
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:29,519
buyers on the market that are you know

2029
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:31,359
the consumers that are buying from

2030
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,199
stores they're going to want something

2031
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,158
that looks like an indoor product and

2032
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:36,678
the next best thing I think is the

2033
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:38,679
greenhouse most definitely most

2034
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:40,719
definitely so we working with a lot of

2035
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:42,840
Partnerships coming up and um we're

2036
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:45,639
excited to kind of get get talking about

2037
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:48,000
those but uh yeah man there's so much

2038
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:50,560
cool stuff on the horizon yeah is just

2039
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,639
opening the door for not only like

2040
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,600
growing in times when you shouldn't be

2041
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:56,159
or in areas where it's very tough like

2042
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,920
you know winter runs and Greenies but

2043
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:00,559
also genetics that don't really have

2044
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,639
that much yield like all these genetics

2045
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:06,320
that we can't run in scale you know

2046
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:07,600
Skittles being one of them one of those

2047
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:09,000
like you can't really do it in

2048
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,800
commercial settings because it just

2049
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,158
doesn't make money I mean my friends do

2050
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,880
yeah yeah I know I know I know they're
