contributed to getting us to the point

36
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,239
we're at our producers amazing yeah um

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,720
you know and then just working the

38
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,280
camera angles and getting the stuff all

39
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,640
dialed in it takes a lot of work and

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
time

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,399

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,280
man this is this is nice at least a

46
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,559
fridge [ __ ] well I mean it's one of

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,519
those things it's like we've gotten

48
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,920
things over a period of time but we had

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,560
an idea coming in and we executed on the

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
idea and it was actually a little bit

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,118
different going into it like we were

52
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,600
like okay well here's where we're going

53
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,200
to go and we went a little bit to the

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,239
right yeah and I think it turned out the

55
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,920
best you know we had we started with

56
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,519
different cameras and realized the

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,719
cameras we got weren't the cameras we

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,598
needed yeah and so these are kind you

59
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,639
know there's learning curves with

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,238
everything absolutely absolutely so and

61
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,279
then I did podcasts with the future

62
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,400
cannabis project in the beginning and

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,039
that was totally different because

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,920
during covid and it was all over the

65
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,199
internet I much prefer the in-person

66
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:26,000
interviews same bro same I I've yet to

67
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,199
do an internet podcast I really don't

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,719
yeah I don't want to do it unless it's

69
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,000
like a legend that there's no way I'm

70
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,800
going to see him right so in Europe or

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,598
Antarctica yeah yeah we can run it yeah

72
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,879
yeah yeah totally and those things might

73
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,759
happen but you know and they can be

74
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,639
great too one of our best episodes was

75
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,399
Reggie godino and it wasn't even the

76
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,399
best quality video but the conversation

77
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,640
was really good nice so but there's

78
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,360
something to be said about in person

79
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,199
it's more intimate you can smoke

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,080
together absolutely you can hang out you

81
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,318
learn more about the person you know

82
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,080
when you look him in the eye and you're

83
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,679
talking about it yeah for sure F the

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,480
energy you know what I'm saying see if

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,400

what I mean Just Vibe and build you know

87
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,158
for sure yeah so how did you get into

88
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,599
podcasting so I got into podcasting um

89
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:12,679
it was you know before I launched good

90
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,280
pizza the brand um I knew I needed to

91
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,280
create media around it and I've always

92
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,759
wanted to do a podcast like I always I

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,640
literally had a note in my phone that

94
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,840
was you know it was a podcast note like

95
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,639
if I would ever have a podcast what the

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,878
questions would I asked these all high

97
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,039
thoughts while I'm driving and [ __ ] I

98
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,318
put it in my note and then like you know

99
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,280
fast forward a couple years later when

100
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm actually about to launch good pizza

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,158
in the bre market like really put it out

102
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,640
there um you know I've I've helped I've

103
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,199
helped build Brands I know what it's

104
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,719
like to get on the shelves and come off

105
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,359
them shelves like you can get lost in

106
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:49,199
the stack easily in California wck so uh

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,920
I wanted to introduce myself before

108
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,560
introducing myself so that was why I did

109
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,958
it right and I've I thought podcasts

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
were cool you know I mean I love Joe

111
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,120
Rogan and I study you know what I'm

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,598
saying podcast like and I didn't really

113
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,400
know what podcast what a podcast was

114
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:05,759
until like two years before I moved out

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,360
here I didn't know what that [ __ ]

116
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,158
purple app was on my phone no idea what

117
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,439
that was bro and then I tapped it one

118
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:18,478
day and I and I fell in love bro so long

119
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,599
story short um I started the podcast um

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,439
and I really wasn't taking it too

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,919
seriously like it was just really for

122
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,279
the brand but then I you know I started

123
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,519
get some cool guests and then one day my

124
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,119
homeboy Paul from proper doinks told me

125
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,599
while we were smoking he's like yo bro

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,160
you know you're you're literally

127
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,240
documenting the end of cannabis

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,199
prohibition yeah like when our grandkids

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,400
grandkids watch these [ __ ] videos

130
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,520
they're going to know how it went down

131
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,000
who was there who had what strain like

132
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,879
bro you're literally documenting this

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,720
[ __ ] for the game bro I'm like and it

134
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,000
[ __ ] me up yeah like it totally

135
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,680
shifted my whole paradig like I'm like

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,600
damn I got a civic duty now [ __ ] you

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
know and yeah we have this duty to tell

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,080
a story it's so much bigger than anyone

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,478
person and that's the beauty of these

140
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,879
podcasts is like this is the information

141
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,079
100 years 200 or 300 years that

142
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,038
hopefully they'll be able to look back

143
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,159
on and go that's what happened in this

144
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,560
moment exactly exactly and I feel like

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,680
this is a big turning point in cannabis

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
yeah I mean over the last five years

147
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,160
especially it's been pretty wild it's

148
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,199
not very stable you know we're both in

149
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,759
the California market and it's like very

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,120
unstable and it's kind of hard to

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
predict what's going to happen next but

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
it's great getting all these different

153
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,478
opinions and stories and legends you

154
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,280
know it's like you've had some Legends

155
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,478
on your show definitely bro you know

156
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,038
I've been blessed to have some Legends

157
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:34,079
on my show and it's just you know

158
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,120
Richard delisi spent 32 years in prison

159
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,159
and that was one of the life-changing

160
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,600
episodes for me and it was like I I got

161
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,439
some great ones with other people too

162
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,439
but that one had a lot of impact on me

163
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,160

dog you're a legend bro yeah I mean his

179
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,879
stories are legendary you know and it's

180
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,319
like they I can't wait for the

181
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,360
documentary to come out on him and they

182
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,759
need to make a movie about his life

183
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
because his life you know he was in a

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,439
time where it was way different than it

185
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,598
is now it was way more illegal you had

186
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,038
to have way bigger balls and the the the

187
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,918
punishment was way bigger yeah and then

188
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,318
even with him it's like they threw the

189
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,719
book at him and they didn't even have

190
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,919
any real evidence right you know it's

191
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,360
circumstantial [ __ ] all circumstantial

192
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,120
it's crazy this man 96 years 98 years

193
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
yeah 90 some odd years and then he

194
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,879
served 32 years of of almost a 100e

195
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,279
sentence it's like it's kind of

196
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,719
mind-blowing that you could put someone

197
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,239
in prison that long for that yeah for

198
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,800
this plant and I think as cannabis is

199
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,759
becoming normalized people are starting

200
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,759
to realize that [ __ ] that that was a

201
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,960
mistake that kind of stuffff is wrong

202
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,840
yeah bro you know at least I hope I hope

203
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,638
even my parents you know they live in

204
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,198
Texas where it's very conservative but

205
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,759
Texas is changing the landscape's

206
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,840
changing over there yeah bro for as

207
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,639
legal illegal as cannabis is in Texas

208
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,000
them boys got balls of steel how they

209
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,160
moving over there bro you have to you

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,120
have to they're moving mean in Texas bro

211
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,080
well they have you know they

212
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,918
circumvented the law and you know and

213
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,598
worked within the loopholes right and so

214
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,079
there's all these CBD shops and so they

215
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,439
don't have dispensaries they got CBD

216
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,959
shops and they're all selling thca yeah

217
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,478
you know and it's they've got big Brands

218
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,680
over there you know crushing it yeah I

219
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,959
love it I love it too and I mean that's

220
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,879
like the loophole for legality and I

221
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,519
think it's also a great way for the

222
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,439
general population people that live in

223
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,839
Texas to get acceptance over it because

224
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,038
everybody's going in there buying it you

225
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,679
know they're selling sh tons of flower

226
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,199
hell yeah so it's yeah it's pretty wild

227
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,560
I mean all these states and how we've

228
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,400
been maneuvered and the the problem with

229
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,560
California is taxation absolutely

230
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,000

284
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,440

286
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,200
acid before I takeen acid like 10 times

287
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,959
10 times what and then cuz I was I was

288
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,560
into sports I was at the bay area so I

289
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,518
was I was born in Portland but I grew up

290
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,439
in the bay and so there's this huge

291
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,959
Grateful Dead Community Inay area so

292
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,120
acid is everywhere right and so it was

293
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,399
this little piece of paper and I'm like

294
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,959
well that couldn't be so bad so I tried

295
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,399
the paper and I was scared of smoking

296
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,799
cuz I was running cross country in high

297
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,839
school and I was sucked at running cross

298
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,559
country I was I was a bigger kid and

299
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
trying to run and so I was like oh if I

300
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,719
smoke it I'll be even worse and so I

301
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,559
held out and then eventually I smoked

302
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,800
and I was like oh I found my calling you

303
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,278

304
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,879

00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,159
garage closet to a garage garage for the

324
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,519
longest time I was scared to go to like

325
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,519
Warehouse grows yeah and my buddy who

326
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,200
went from growing in my garage with me

327
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,720
went into a bigger space 50 lighter

328
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,519
which was huge for the time this is like

329
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,040
that's big early 2000s he had a

330
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,039
warehouse he got busted at the warehouse

331
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,719
so I'm like oh I don't want to do

332
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,399
Warehouse that's too crazy and this the

333
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,759
the thing is is like you could have a

334
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,759
eight lighter in your garage and be

335
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,838
extremely profitable it was making good

336
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,319
money and uh yeah it was interesting

337
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,760
times we had amazing genetics back then

338
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,480
you know what were you running I started

339
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,360
growing in my garage we had had

340
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,720

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,240
blueberry that we grow real tall they I

343
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,599
didn't realize they were going to double

344
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,680
and so we vegged them a little too long

345
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,440
and then they grew up into the lights

346
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:17,198
you know and then we had uh Trinity we

347

373
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,519

374
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,000
too because it was the ugliest yeah it

375

00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,360
smell the whole room like literally yeah

388
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,639
you could have a tenth of a gram and you

389
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,639

what's going on you know what crazy like

391
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,159
I know I had it right but like I I got

392
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,759
it on the East Coast um and like this is

393
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,399
before like we had names on bags and

394
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,320
[ __ ] this is probably like

395
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,759
06 that was the first time I ever seen

396
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,320
it and I and looking back to it like

397
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,159
that was cat piss bro like nobody ever

398
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,959
told me it was cat piss right but like

399
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,559
dog I smell like piss it was ammonia it

400
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,439
was I've never seen anything like it

401
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,239
that had to be it yeah $60 a straight up

402
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,519
um and I the thing is is like so cat

403
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,198
piss is the

404
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,560
description of a smell and Aroma right

405
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,758
so I think there's multiple cat pisses

406
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,278
what people think of cat piss there's a

407
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,120
you know SoCal cat piss NorCal cat piss

408
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,799
there's other cat pisses I heard there

409
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,959
was even cat pisses back in the 70s

410
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,679
right there was a cat piss so I feel

411
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,439
like it's a description of an aroma so

412
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,399
there can be multiple copies it's not

413
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,079
like blue dream which is a specific name

414
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,120
right sure uh so I feel like there's a

415
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,679
lot of arguing going on online like oh

416
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,159

417

418
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,958
that doesn't mean it was the only cap is

419
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,519

00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,879
bunch of Dimes like 20 dimes and go back

484
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:13,838
to our town and S for 20 right you know

485
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,280
what I'm saying just a quick bubble up

486
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,759
stupid little kid [ __ ] you know what I'm

487
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,678
saying but uh but I realized really fast

488
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:22,240
like how quickly you could be the man in

489
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,319
your town if you had something that

490
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,279
nobody had you know for sure and I was a

491
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,399
young boy I was the youngest kid always

492
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,678
the youngest kid in my crew and uh you

493
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
know I would see the the tables turned

494
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,960
like some older homies want to hang out

495
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,200
with you now like what the [ __ ] right

496
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,480
this shit's got power bro yeah I was in

497
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,880
Boy Scouts when I was a kid so okay not

498
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,759
say anything bad about the Boy Scouts

499
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,160
but there was a lot of action going on

500
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,839
the Boy Scouts with weed really drugs

501
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,240
and alcohol and everything yeah it

502
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,959
wasn't what people I mean and there was

503
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,319
a good sign you know and I don't think

504
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,919
of cannabis is a bad thing but

505
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,759
definitely there was a lot of weed

506
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,360
getting passed around and that's where I

507
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,599
got exposed to it too and the Boy Scouts

508
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,839
shout out to the Boy Scouts dude the

509
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,719

520
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:32,879
the first time I went to uh New York on

521
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:35,918
a trip as an adult was 1999 and I was

522
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,880
going there for work okay and I uh was

523
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,280
kind of by myself and I went to this

524
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,440
restaurant called Nooks that was in uh

525
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,158
by the Empire State Building okay and

526
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,720
this dude named Jimmy the Greek own

527
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,080
owned nooks and we were talking about

528
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,079
weed and next thing you know he's like

529
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,240
oh you want to hang out with me and my

530
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,720
friends I'm like if I can get some good

531
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,519
weed so he takes me out and he gets me

532
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,640
this white bud I never seen white weed

533
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,079
in my life it was the whitest weed I've

534
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,960
ever seen and the story this the BS

535
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,319
story which most likely BS was that it

536
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,558
was grown in the sewers with the

537
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,200
alligators and that's why it was white

538
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,038
because of the lack of you know [ __ ] out

539
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,120
yeah yeah but everyone goty white or

540
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,759
like the weed was white the weed was

541
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,839
white it was the white it was so it was

542
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,599
like light bur but it was so white I I

543
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:21,158
actually flew back home with it I put it

544
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,558
in a pen cap and flew back home with it

545
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,159
because I had to show all my friends

546
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,599
yeah yeah and so we had to get it out

547
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,280
with you know you had to get a needle to

548
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,798
pull it out and I had this little tiny

549
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,918
piece of it to smoke with my friends

550
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,119
like the whitest weed I've ever seen it

551
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,720
it got me really high okay so it was

552
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,599
probably lightburn looking back at it

553
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,360
you know what I mean but like it was 100

554
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,839
bucks for a gram and yeah and so if

a handful of things that were sweet and

614
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,760
as far as like meno perss we used to go

615
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,159
to Menino and get purple weed so yeah

616
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,798
that that was around back then we never

617
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,640
seen that back then we' have lost our

618
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,319
[ __ ] minds if we seen purple weed bro

619
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
oh yeah and there was definitely that

620
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,879
was like $4,500 a pound in the '90s like

621
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,918
outdoor was as expensive or more than

622
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,880
indoor you know especially the good

623
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,600
stuff I I just I remember the outdoor

624
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,039
being so amazing back then um and I

625
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,000
think there was a lot L there was there

626
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,599
was a lot less of it than there is now

627
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
yeah same thing with indoor and I think

628
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,439
there was a lot of people that were

629
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,080
super passionate about it like you had

630
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,080
to be more passionate about it because

631
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,639
you were taking more risk way more there

632
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,119
was so much on the line and there were

633
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,919
still people that grew mids I mean I had

634
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,719
friends that just grew mediocre yeah and

635
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,919
I feel like there's this ego thing that

636
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,319
when you grow it yourself and you've

637
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,600
been with the plant for that long and

638
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,798
you harvest it that you take pride in

639
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,439
however you did I still have some

640
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:44,119
friends like that and their stuff is

641
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,440
mid-grade and it's hard to recognize

642
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,959
sometimes when your stuff is mediocre

643
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,200
and I try to be

644
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,278
very subjective you know with and honest

645
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,000
with people too for sure you should be

646
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:56,679
when I'm growing it's like I constantly

647
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,119
am trying how can I make this better

648
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,919
each time I feel like it's never good

649
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,319
enough I feel like the best Growers out

650
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
there they're never fully satisfied with

651
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,798
each run there's always something they

652
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,798
could improve on a little bit and know

653
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,519
what else they want your feedback if

654
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:11,240
you're like a real curator like myself

655
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,519
and other people like with brands that

656
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,038
give a [ __ ] about equality yeah like

657
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,079
they really do want your opinion like we

658
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:19,798
set the Eagles aside like you got to set

659
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,839
the ego aside and look at it separately

660
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,158
100% like when we're fena hunting right

661
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,199
for example we're going through you know

662
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,679
700 plants yeah it's a lot of work but

663
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,519
like you're really trying to find the

664
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,519
best of the best and the only way to do

665
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,158
that is be getting getting uh honest

666
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,119
feedback from people yeah so and also I

667
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,480
quit giving people flour I'm done with

668
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,719
giving people flour with pheno hunts

669
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,120
it's like you get joints we're going to

670
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,440
give you pre-rolls you're going to tell

671
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,119
me how does it taste and how does it

672
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,278
make you feel yeah those are the two

673
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:50,519
most important things and flavors are

674
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,400
especially hard um in a feno hunt in a

675
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:53,759
feno hunt because a lot of stuff looks

676
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,080
good you want to you want to pick one

677
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,759
that looks good to I mean look is

678
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,879
important yeah don't get me wrong bag

679
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,919
appeal is extremely important unless you

680
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,880
got Skittles unless you got Skittles

681
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,559
unless you got Skittles yeah Skittles

682
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,278
goes a long way because it has like it's

683
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,399
like you know kind of ciss it's like

684
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,400
they doesn't have great bag appeal but

685
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,200
it also fetches high dollar right now

686
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,440
yeah it does it does for sure five in

687
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,360
the street 10 in the bed man it's pretty

688
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,038
wild it's pretty wild and you know and

689
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,678
it's not easy to grow and so I feel like

690
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,119
that's one of those ones that deserves

691
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,919
more money you deserve more money for

692
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,079
growing it you know so for sure so what

693
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,919
do you think about all these Skittles

694
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,519
cross

695
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,120
the diet Skittles there's lots of diet

696
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,918
Skittles have you seen anything that's

697
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,678
as good as Skittles that's across the

698
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,000
Skittles nope have not and I'll tell you

699
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,720
what um I just interviewed Ted from

700
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,319
Alien labs for the second time we did it

701
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,360
round it was my first round two episode

702
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,798
he said it the best and I never even

703
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:49,119
thought of it like this shout out to Ted

704
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,759
he was like bro why are we chasing all

705
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,678
these [ __ ] Skittles crosses bro

706
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,200
there's nothing better than Skittles

707
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,038
Skittles is there it's at the top how

708
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,240
you how you going to beat the top yeah

709
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:57,839
you know what I'm saying like why are we

710
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,278
trying to do it like it's if it ain't

711
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,639
broke don't fix it now I know what we're

712
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,519
all thinking and I was chasing it too

713
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,840
and I've I've done pheno hunts with Z

714
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:09,000
crosses I popped hell of [ __ ] of Z

715
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,240
crosses like bro they just don't do it

bro like well going through Skittles

717
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,480
s1's is silly in my opinion because

718
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,278
you're not going to find anything better

719
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,839
than the original Skittles you might

720
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:20,319

there's like Z in there way the [ __ ]

761
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,879
down in there but it's super complex

762
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,798
belts um I actually was able to give

763
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,120
some of that to Fletcher when I finally

764

768
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,519
it yeah you know I'm I'm we're trying to

769
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,960
bring some light to that flavor you know

770
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:15,639
and people seem to really like it you

771
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,440
know I just I just feel like I just need

772
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,200
a name change cuz ice cream tripped me

773
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,320
out I didn't want to nobody likes ice

774
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,720
cream what I'm saying bro it's it's sad

775
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,398
cuz I think really good ice cream cake

776
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,640
it's good yeah there's nothing wrong

777
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:28,479
with really good it got flooded on the

778
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,679
market and so same thing with wedding

779
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,120
cake right really good bready wedding

780
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,159
cake that's gassy and bready yeah I like

781
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,439
it I'll still smoke it I enjoy smoking

782
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,360
same uh and then ice cream cake makes

783
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,960
great extract like the rosin is

784
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,119
phenomenal if you do it right if they

785
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
pick it early like I really like that

786
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,239
flavor and then same thing with the

787
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,759
flour if it's done right but also I

788
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,880
think there's a lot of inferior cuts out

789
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,720
there and there's a lot of people

790
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,679
growing shitty versions of it and then

791
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,360
it puts a bad name out there absolutely

792
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,320
absolutely so and then jbz he released

793
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,079
wedding cake seeds so there's all these

794
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,480
phenotypes right there's 30 different

795
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:02,839
pheno types out there that people are

796
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,120
growing when this all started I'm pretty

797
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:06,480
sure that went out there okay well

798
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,439
that'd be the only explanation for why

799
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,278
there are so many pheno types unless

800
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,320
they're s1's for sure for sure so yeah I

801
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,079
mean I think that wedding cake is the

802
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,480
best example because there's three or

803
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:19,158
four decent ones there's one that's just

804
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,038
phenomenal that smokes amazing it

805
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,480
doesn't yield as much as like the ones

806
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,679
my buddy grows he they yield like crazy

807
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,798
they look really really good but it

808
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,960
gives me that purple punch let down

809
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,839
which I I mean I feel like that's the

810
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,600
best way to describe it yeah they go a

811
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,639
little longer too right they do a little

812
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:37,439
bit longer yeah yeah so what I moved

813
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,679
here cakes were still popping bro cakes

814
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,640
were [ __ ] nice and greasy and just oh

815
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,240
yeah alien Labs had a dope cake yeah

816
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,000
yeah yeah for sure yeah shout out to

817
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,319
alien Labs they've been crushing for a

818
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,919
long time you should get Ted on the show

819
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,519
bro absolutely he's [ __ ] the best

820
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,960
interviewer bro yeah I've seen I've seen

821
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,120
your interview with him it's great yeah

822
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,679
he's good man he's good yeah that in the

823
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,319
Caleb interview was was great one you

824
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,600
just Caleb was phenomenal yeah thank you

825
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,200
bro I really enjoyed that thoroughly I

826
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,240
actually got to get up with bro yeah

827
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,960
good times man it's it's fun being able

828
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,278
to hear different stories from different

829
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,679
people and get a different perspective

830
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,359
it is especially that group yeah yeah

831
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,600
yeah I mean like that was like Turning

832
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,839
Point cannabis World [ __ ] you know what

833
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,558
I mean right and those guys are working

834
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,079
with some of the best genetics out there

835
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,599
I feel like they understand cannabis on

836
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,199
a level that's much different than a lot

837
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,359
of people yeah and also the business

838
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,038
side of it yeah for sure I mean how much

839
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,240
do we learn on our podcast about

840
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,679
business about like I'm I'm there for

841
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,798
you guys but I'm really taking notes

842
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,960
like I'm I'm I'm like really interested

843
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,278
like Ted Caleb burner I just interviewed

844
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,038
yesterday I'm like really asking them

845
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,159
like yo so how'd you do it yeah tell me

846
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:47,240
about the corporation how do you form a

847
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,720
corporation how do you do this how do

848
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,599
you do that like I'm [ __ ] like dog

849
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,720
you did it bro I want to know yeah he

850
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,599
did it he did I mean he's proof he's

851
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,240
proof that anybody can do it and like

852
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,158
back to what you were saying like these

853
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,120
interesting people like you know let's

854
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,559
talk about like the whole how the cookie

855
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,639
[ __ ] went down like you know I think you

856
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:06,879
should get interviews from burner I

857
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,320
think you should get [ __ ] I think you

858
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,679
should get shinsky I think you should

859
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:15,558
get flux uh straight flame um and Caleb

860
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,038
out of all those stories who was off and

861
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,398
Kenny Powers and Kenny Powers especially

862
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:21,919
like he he don't want to hop on yet you

863
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:25,918
know what saying get that's cool that's

864
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,360
cool soon or later soon or later but um

865
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,480
you know if and they're all different

866
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,079
versions of the story obviously cuz

867
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,159
you've seen it through your lens but

868
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,000
like you'll get like the the big picture

869
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,519
you know what I'm saying when first

870
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,679
smoke did the all their interviews like

871
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,759
I would tell people like yo you really

872
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,399
want to know the cookie story tapen into

873
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,558
these these podcasts you got to get in

874
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,558
all those guys perspective each story is

875
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,000
a little bit different exactly exactly

876
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,639
so yeah and that's the beauty of this

877
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,038
whole thing is like we're able to get

878
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,919
these different perspectives from

879
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,839
different people and opinions and we all

880
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,159
have a different lens that we've seen

881
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,199
the world through because we've all went

882
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,559
through different things sure and uh

883
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,440
yeah and it we're we're in an amazing

884
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,278
time cuz it's not stabilized yet we're

885
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,080
not sure where it's going genetics is

886
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:09,038
still we're scratching the surface of it

887
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:10,480
it's not fully patented yet it's you

888
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,359
know people aren't out of the game

889
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,120
because they don't have money you can

890
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,599
still be an amazing breeder and do it

891
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,278
with a small handful of plants if you

892
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,599
know how to grow really well definitely

893
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:21,319
and at the end of the day it's all about

894
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,638
like can you grow really well and make

895
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,638
the plant Express so you can tell the

896
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:25,319
difference between the phenotypes yeah

897
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,558
for

898
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,000
sure so and there's a handful of people

899
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:33,480
doing it right and there's a bunch of

900
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,519
people doing it so I yeah so and it's

901
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,079
like and it's so subjective too to what

902
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,558
good genetics are but I think we could

903
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,720
probably smoke a handful of joints and

904
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,398
agree that these ones are all great and

905
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,399
these ones are all mediocre and then we

906
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:48,839
might have a difference of preference at

907
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:50,879
the top so yeah yeah like uh White Ash

908
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:53,519
what's your opinion on White Ash White

909
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,960
Ash is the last check box bro um we got

910
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,359
to get off that [ __ ] bro it's so much

911
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,759
easier to sell weed without this white

912
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,319
ass [ __ ] [ __ ] uh can we curse on

913
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:04,558
the show we can say what the [ __ ] we

914
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:06,480
want 100% [ __ ] right yeah um so

915
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,798
white ass right so I look for four

916
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,319
things right and um I'll give props to

917
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,879
proper doinks for kind of

918
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,079
like enlightening me to these things

919
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,240
like I always knew they were there but I

920
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:19,439
never knew what to look for so like I go

921
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,000
by um flavor translation strength of

922
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,320
Flavor Flavor longevity is big for me

923
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,200
cuz I don't like joints that like taste

924
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,839
like [ __ ] halfway through I feel like if

925
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,399
you got a joint that tastes like [ __ ]

926
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,199
halfway through I just sold you half an

927
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,158
ounce for whatever I sold or a half e

928
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,000
cuz you're not going to smoke the whole

929
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,960
thing I'm not smoking that bro um and

930
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,480
then so after flavor flavor longevity is

931
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,360
smoothness yeah you know what I'm saying

932
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,639
I don't want a throat roasting joint you

933
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,319
know what I'm saying it's burning super

934
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:49,000
hot um and then once when all those it

935
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,079
seems like when all those things check

936
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,119
the boxes holy [ __ ] the white is the ash

937
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,480
is really white yeah you know so and

938
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:55,879
that's you know combustibility it's not

939
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,000
always the case but a lot of time I have

940
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,039
some some genetics that just do not get

941
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,119
white ass yeah yeah yeah for sure

942
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,960
they'll be salt and pepper Sal pepper

943
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,000
they be though no they will not be

944
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,480
that's a yeah they will not be black

945
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,880
ain't nothing wrong with a little Peppa

946
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,000
no you know what I'm saying but like

947
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,679
look is if it's burn white do I get

948
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,079
excited [ __ ] yeah I can make the video

949
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,880
people get pumped up they want to buy

950
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,158
your weed you know what I'm saying

951
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,080
that's the world we live in right now

952
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,679
yeah well you can add a couple points on

953
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,119
that pound right you [ __ ] can dude I

954
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,798
can't even sell it if it's like that

955
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,119
like I've create i' pigeon hold myself

956
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,879
in this little [ __ ] connoisseur

957
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,678
Corner yeah you know what I'm saying and

958
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,240
like it all has to Che out but like good

959
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,600
pizza is also a standard of weed like

960
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,159
that when it goes through all the that's

961
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:37,158
my QC process then it's good pizza and I

962
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,840
put it in my bag if it don't it's a work

963
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,320
pack right you know yeah I mean I I

964
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,199
think that's a good place to pigeon hole

965
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,960
yourself in though it's way better than

966
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,798
the other direction yeah the bottom is

967
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,960
rough right now the guys are just dying

968
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,278
off left and right and it's it's really

969
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,558
hard to

970
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:55,798
maintain uh a product where you're in

971
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,918
competition with these guys that can

972
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,200
produce for $250 a pound exactly $300 a

973
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,559
pound so why would you even want to be

974
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,679
there now is the time where you gota you

975
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:04,879
got to be on the other end of the

976
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,360
spectrum if you don't have the best

977
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,760
product there's no reason really doing

978
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:12,559
this anymore no there's not no there's

979
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:16,320
not and the korur market is the 1% 10%

980
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:18,039
whatever you want to call it yeah um but

981
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,559
that is a significant amount of people

982
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,639
based on how many people smoke weed you

983
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,559
know what I'm saying yeah and um and you

984
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,079
can still get tickets in that world you

985
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:29,199
know and uh I did brand at the [ __ ]

986
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,159
perfect time you know thank God bro

987
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:35,358
thank God I did because you selling bags

988
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,760
bro you chasing 25 cents nowadays bro

989
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,119
yeah you know you get a box play with

990
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,520
your men's y'all split in a quarter or

991
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,559
50 cents maybe maybe nobody's getting

992
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:44,358
dollars no

993
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,759
more maybe I mean they are so they are

994
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:47,559
but those are the ones that that aren't

995
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,480
working in volume right the guys that

996
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,358
are you know the boutique guys that are

997
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,800
like okay $4,500

998
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:57,679
$4,500 right so like those guys are

999
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,280
still making two point like 200 points

1000
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm making more than I sell [ __ ] box

1001
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,160
bro I sell a [ __ ] five pack for sure

1002
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,960
you know it's crazy bro yeah I know it's

1003
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,799
it's a wild world and it's it's still

1004
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,519
the Wild Wild West it's it's it's wild

1005
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,039
you know and the thing is the same thing

1006
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,400
with genetics if you don't have the best

1007
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,880
or something different like you can't

1008
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,000
just do the same thing as everybody else

1009
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,280
anymore that just going to fly like if

1010
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,440
you haven't figured that out as a

1011
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,960
breeder that you can't just go make

1012
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,159
another gelato don't do it there's no

1013
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,320
reason even doing it you're not going to

1014
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,078
get a lot of money for your seeds U

1015
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,119
unless you're making really really

1016
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,400
stable seeds that you can throw acre

1017
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,280
worth of seeds out you're not going to

1018
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,358
have intersex trades like there is

1019
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,400
market for that but there's that's a lot

1020
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:41,319
more different yeah a lot more difficult

1021
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,800
than it is to make it make a cross

1022
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,599
making something that's super stable

1023
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,720
that you can put out in a field it's not

1024
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,960
going to Herm out I mean that's that's

1025
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,799
challenging uh there's a lot of R&amp;D

1026
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,838
involved there's a lot of work and time

1027
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,560
and energy and that's why I get money

1028
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,199
for my seeds that you know that don't

1029
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:00,440
have interex traits they go you can put

1030
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:03,039
5 Acres out or 10 acres out and reliably

1031
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,838
get a good crop absolutely so and we do

1032
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,800
have some of those gelato turps you know

1033
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:09,519
and but but that's the difference um and

1034
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,720
moving forward it's like you want to

1035
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,159
have something that's going to separate

1036
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,199
your customer from everybody else yeah

1037
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,318
so my main job is to empower my

1038
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,799
customers to grow better flour to get

1039
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:21,119
better results and have something

1040
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,039
different and so it's exciting to me I

1041
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,920
like banana I like banana turps I like

1042
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,079
too man yeah happened in banana OG that

1043
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,800
[ __ ] was crazy it was so I have I have a

1044
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,280

1045
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,480

1046
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,319

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,000
the Grenadines which is a Caribbean

1091

so he took me to St Vincent one of the

1098
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,679
poorest Islands I've ever been to not

1099
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:33,039
even one it was the it was my exposure

1100
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,799
to what real poverty is right sure sure

1101
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,599
type [ __ ] and how happy the people are

1102
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,119
that are living in poverty yeah you need

1103
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,640
to see that as an American you do and it

1104
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,880
made me realize that maybe I could do

1105
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,920
something to help these people out their

1106
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,838
economy revolved around bananas I was

1107
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,800
like let's make some banana crosses so

1108
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:51,000
we are going to go give the minister of

1109
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,359
Agriculture banana crosses 20 of them in

1110
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,318
seed form to give out to the people and

1111
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,799
so this was my idea with Marlin years

1112
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:59,559
ago and finally with Co it delayed this

1113
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,079
whole process but now we're going out

1114
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,799
next month to give these seeds away oh

1115
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,079
that's so cool man what a contribution

1116
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,318
to the game and Humanity bro I feel like

1117
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,039
that's what we all need to do is figure

1118
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:10,400
out ways we can help other people step

1119
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:11,719
up and you know and I think there

1120
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,920
there'll be some media coverage but it's

1121
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,598
not even about that it's about being

1122
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,280
able to give something that can Empower

1123
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,119
other people to make their lives better

1124
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,960
definitely bro so educ congratulations

1125
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,760
on that project man that's cool and it's

1126
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,960
a lot of fun I mean when you're giv back

1127
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,960
like that whatever you put into stuff

1128
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,679
like that it pays you back tenfold

1129
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,159
absolutely bro absolutely yeah that's a

1130
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,078
that's a nice little check mark on The

1131
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:35,000
Good Karma side of life you know you got

1132
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,720
to do stuff like that you know and so

1133
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,480
Canadians there was a bunch of Canadian

1134
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,879
LPS that went into St Vincent and

1135
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,519
Jamaica and all these others and they

1136
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,200
were all about making money and so

1137
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:46,679
they're basically trying to take out of

1138
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,118
the island off of the island they're

1139
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,559
trying to extract money off of this

1140
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,160
thing and it's like I don't want to be

1141
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,838
that guy I want to go in there to help

1142
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,000
the people I don't care about the money

1143
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,119
there like I If we don't make a penny

1144
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,760
which I assume we probably won't yeah we

1145
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,838
we'll get some good publicity and stuff

1146
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,200
but we're going to do the right thing

1147
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:03,960
and we're going to help people that need

1148
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,719
help hell yeah you know and there's a

1149
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,000
lot of people this is only one Island

1150
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:10,598
there's people all over the world that

1151
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,199
need help and we We As Americans have

1152
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,039
the power to make a difference we do so

1153
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,639
what's the weed laws like on St Vincent

1154
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,239
can they cultivate cool yeah and they

1155
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:21,838
have medical licenses so yeah they have

1156
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,679
dude they have a they have a spiritual

1157
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,799
license too like a yeah it's like is

1158
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,399
that bro like a religious license

1159
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,359
because Canabis is a religious thing

1160
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,200
thing yeah and so yeah they have it's

1161
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:34,400
biblical son dude it's amazing that's

1162
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,239
how it should be yeah bro for real we

1163
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,039
went there and spoke to uh the Cannabis

1164
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:41,199
Authority which is their governing body

1165
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,480
for cannabis yeah right so Marlin and I

1166
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,919
was It was supposed to be like a 30

1167
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,559
minute little lecture who we are

1168
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,720
whatever it was a three-hour lecture wow

1169
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,000
and they kept raising their hands asking

1170
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:50,679
more questions and I was like can we

1171
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,358
just keep going because this is great it

1172
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:53,759
was the first time in my life where the

1173
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:55,239
government was like and this is the

1174
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,599
government right there people from the

1175
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:59,439
government that were like we want to

1176
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,640
make our people better how can we do

1177
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,880
this and I was talking about pollen

1178
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,078
mitigation I'm like you don't want

1179
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,559
regular seeds on the island necessarily

1180
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,200
you want to get rid of males because

1181
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,039
such a small island there has to be

1182
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,799
pollen mitigation so you don't pollinate

1183
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,318
people's crops sure that was one of the

1184
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,440
things we talked about and then they

1185
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:17,559
wanted to know about indica and sativa

1186
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,119
and THC levels and so I was like THC

1187
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,318
isn't the end all be all which I think

1188
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,358
is extremely important especially from a

1189
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:26,559
medicinal level right uh but the people

1190
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,960
of St Vincent and the government there

1191
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,639
is really into the medicinal side of it

1192
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,400
and how can they make their people

1193
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,838
better how can it benefit their people

1194
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,720
in a good way and so even the minister

1195
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,239
of Agriculture there amazing guy we get

1196
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:40,559
to meet him and sit down with him last

1197
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:42,039
time and so I'm looking forward to being

1198
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,078
able to sit down with him again and

1199
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,279

1203
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,559

1204
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,280
like at the end of the day I got my

1205

1208
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:03,519
published it and I mean we because it's

1209
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,720
a much bigger project just like this

1210
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:09,880
podcast and myself yeah and so 380 pages

1211
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:12,639
I had over 20 contributing writers that

1212
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,240

1214
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,838
Cuban black Haze let's go bro hell yeah

1215
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:20,558
we got those in tissue culture as well

1216
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,480
so really yeah so we'll have them out

1217
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,040
probably I'm thinking within the next

1218
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,079
month and a half two months we'll have

1219
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:27,679
plants of piff let me know I guess I'm

1220
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,920
might run a couple lights that for me

1221
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,519
bro I know that's what you need just a

1222
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,358
little smoke right just a little

1223
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:34,719
something for the head bro and I really

1224
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:36,558
like piff I fell in love Cuban black is

1225
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,118
okay I like Cuban black is that piff

1226
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,480
that's what that's what I'm I'm hearing

1227
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,519
is piff so I believe what you think I

1228
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,119
think the piff is the S1 of the Cuban

1229
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:47,039
black okay these are two different

1230
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,599
plants they're genetically different oh

1231
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:52,079
yeah you got yeah I forget you you got

1232
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,680
so we we work with my fla and stuff like

1233
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,000
that right and and we're able to do some

1234
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,480
testing we can tell that these plants

1235
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,400
are different right okay um now how

1236
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,480
they're related I'm not sure but I

1237
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,599
believe that one of them is an S1 of the

1238
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,440
other one I believe that the piff is

1239
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,480
probably the one that we have is an S1

1240
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,440
of the Cuban black okay and it's really

1241
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,318
good and I feel like it's not one of

1242
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,559
those sativas that shoots you off like a

1243
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:15,358
space rocket you're not shooting out of

1244
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,240
a cannon if SM you get high bro you you

1245
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,358
get high but it's more subtle right it's

1246
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:23,318
not like the super silver it's not like

1247
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:25,400
smoking that it's it's got a you know it

1248
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,119
doesn't burn it doesn't burn on the P it

1249
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,400
burns tasty all the way down to the

1250
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,000
roach and it's it's like a little tiny

1251
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,720
bit floral a little tiny bit Haze it's

1252
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,119
got its own unique thing going on we

1253
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,759
talking about super silver I'm talking

1254
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,440
about the piff the piff yeah yeah yeah

1255
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,760
for sure it's like incense nog Champa

1256
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,079
kind of like spicy peppery TPS you know

1257
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,119
what I'm saying and if it's grown

1258
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,559
correct it right down to that roach

1259
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,039

00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:20,599
we did a show and we smoked some of his

1275
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,358
strawberry cough and I could tell that

1276
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:24,559
he harvested it extra late you know how

1277
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:26,159
like if you go past the harvest date a

1278
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:27,920
little bit or where you could Harvest it

1279
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,199
it's stronger oh yeah right even

1280
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,760
Skittles if you go 63 days or 65 days

1281
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,318
longer and stronger and that Skittles

1282
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,800
especially Skittles you got to take 52

1283
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:41,759
to 54 I'm all about that 53 53 somewhere

1284
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,079
anywhere 52 56 even is fine B difference

1285
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,359
dude and it's the difference if you want

1286
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,960
those melon turps or if you want the gas

1287
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,358
cuz that gas comes in a little bit later

1288
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,358
we don't need the gas bro I don't I

1289
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,920
don't think o o k for if you want that

1290
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,400
it doesn't make me feel as good like the

1291
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,400
effect if you were talking about the way

1292
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,760
it makes you feel I don't like the 63

1293
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,240
day Skittles I don't think it makes me

1294
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,760
feel as good whereas I like that 50 and

1295
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,679
I love that taste where you just want to

1296
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,160
keep hitting it you can keep coming back

1297
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,118
to it you can fire the roach up the next

1298
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,480
day and still smoke it yep you know

1299
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,440
that's the beauty of that Skittles too

1300
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,599
and uh it's it's something special oh

1301
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,358
for sure for sure I mean dog it's it's

1302
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,000
still the big dog on the Block gelato

1303
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,400
come and go I mean I mean runs is still

1304
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,880
here but runs you're not getting tickets

1305
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,119
for runs yeah like everybody runs lcg

1306
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,200
right like so yeah yeah so let's talk

1307
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,200
about that for a second runs LC because

1308
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:32,118
you're familiar with these these sex

1309
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:39,399
tests and like what's what genetically

1310
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:41,039
runs okay gelato 33 lcg go runts lcg

1311
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,079
depending on who you get the cut from

1312
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,880
they're I mean they're they're slightly

1313
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,440
different cut slightly different but I

1314
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,599
think they all came originally there was

1315
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,318
runs and there was one runs and that

1316
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,119
that cut got renamed to lcg and then

1317
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:56,440
they got another cut that they called

1318
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:58,400
runs and then there's the gelato 33 Mis

1319
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,039
label so there's a lot of stuff that's

1320
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,599
gelato 33 out there like there's a lot

1321
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,239
of stuff I mean I've seen the I've seen

1322
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:06,838
the actual test that this and this and

1323
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:08,318
this and this they're on the same side

1324
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:10,920
of the equation the white yeah white

1325
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,838
runs yeah and then also so gelato 33 is

1326
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,119
the most unstable of anything I've ever

1327
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,599
worked with and so when you make s1s of

1328
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,160
it in the sense that genetically

1329
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,119
unstable so what happens is when you

1330
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,118
make s1s you get all these different

1331
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:27,680
Expressions across the board uh SF Cana

1332
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,720
has several different ones that are just

1333
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:30,919
s1's of gelato 33 with different names

1334
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:32,959
on them and they're completely different

1335
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,079
Expressions no [ __ ] like Cherry guava

1336
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,400
completely that that cherry guava is

1337
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:37,839
different but that's special that's

1338
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,639
special bro that's so good see that's

1339
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,078

1347
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,160
you know you got the drip on it got the

1348
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:00,679
white ash it checks all the boxes and

1349
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:02,759
then it tastes like candy you know and

1350
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:07,598
that's special but they have like Mount

1396
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,318
this amazing flavor where I feel like it

1397
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,759
can make if you phenoh hunted correctly

1398
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:52,039
you can find ones that are the the

1399
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,960
flavor you're looking for but more

1400
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:57,519
intense sometimes than the original yeah

1401
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,798
so yeah man shout out to 41 man shout

1402

1403
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:03,559
a staple and just the straight 41 is

1404
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,680
amazing too you can grow it you can

1405
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,599
smoke it I feel like fairly easy to grow

1406
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:10,000
good some of you know some like Skittles

1407
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:12,599
is hard to grow there's a learning curve

1408
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
with Skittles gelato 41 I think a lot of

1409
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,119
people could get that cut and they could

1410
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,519
do pretty well with it yeah so just like

1411
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,240
blue dream that's another one it's not

1412
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,199
my favorite TP but it grows really well

1413
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:24,798
it looks beautiful yeah when I started

1414
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:28,199
growing out here um I crushed a run of

1415
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:30,159
outdoor 41 bro I bet C I was so proud of

1416

Obsolete and mango and my

1486
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,400

right now he makes the best K zones I've

1490
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,440
heard cuz because he [ __ ] his pizza up

1491
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:10,639
so he has to flip it

1535
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:38,480
some people look at it like oh we have

1536
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:40,879
all this time left I don't feel like

1537
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,280
that at all I feel like no dude time is

1538
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,760
very short my time is limited here to

1539
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,400
get all the stuff done that I want to do

1540
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,680
I mean I I'm pretty ambitious as a

1541
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,880
person and I have a lot of goals that I

1542
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:52,159
want to do in my lifetime and it's like

1543
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,599
there's no better time than the present

1544
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,598
to get on those things because you never

1545
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,079
know how much time you got left that's

1546
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,798
true true man and you know it's a

1547
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,798
beautiful time to do stuff too I feel

1548
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:04,039
like uh you know we a lot of people

1549
00:54:02,798 --> 00:54:05,358
think that the world it's getting worse

1550
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,838
and worse and worse I don't think that's

1551
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,279
true I think it's getting better in a

1552
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:10,960
lot of ways I think the economy's [ __ ]

1553
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,680
up yeah I think there's stuff like the

1554
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,440
economy but I think other than Oakland

1555
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,078
it's a lot safer in most places than it

1556
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,119
used to be Oakland's dangerous bro I

1557
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,720
don't think there's any laws in Oakland

1558
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,680
bro it's so crazy crazy yeah San

1559
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,439

1560
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:28,118
but not like Oakland bro no nothing

01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:01,400
but whatever happened along the way

1740
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,440
whether there was different genetics or

1741
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:07,760
whatever I feel like it changed and it

1742
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,880
wasn't like did bro quick yeah quick bro

1743
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,319
people think it's the Clone drop people

1744
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,400
think it's this and that I think when

1745
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:15,358
they scaled it too I think scaling it

1746
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,639
doesn't always work I'm not sure but we

1747
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,239
got it from tissue culture uh we tissue

1748
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:21,759
cultured it and I got it for breeding

1749
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:23,598
and I I like that a lot I like rs1 a lot

1750
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,599
I like z a lot but there's two Z cuts

1751
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:28,240
too that go around oh really let's talk

1752
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,280
about that that bro yeah Z is it's good

1753
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:33,439
two Z cuts for real I I believe there's

1754
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,119
two Z cuts and I haven't I I got to get

1755
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,798
deepe I get a Rob on the show or

1756
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,480
something like that to verify but yeah

1757
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:42,440
there's definitely like a

1758
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,679
spear Z and then there's like the more

1759
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,318
rounded bud zope and so I've seen both

1760
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:48,558
of them and I think they're both good in

1761
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:50,279
their own ways see I never really got

1762
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,440
into Z like everybody bro it doesn't get

1763

at the same time if they don't have a

1894
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,440
big following or if it's not a really

1895
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,519
popular genetic if it's old it's kind of

1896
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,760
tough uh especially in my opinion

1897
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:56,119
especially if it's something that

1898
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,440
describes

1899
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,960
the smell or the aroma or the flavor

1900
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,400
perfectly I feel like that's the first

1901
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,760
goal right when you're when you're

1902
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,440
selecting names like that's the first

1903
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,520
goal okay can we name it after something

1904
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,798
that smells like or tastes like right

1905
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:10,278
but then like sometimes that doesn't

1906
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:12,920
always work and then like okay I can go

1907
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:14,639
into desserts that's [ __ ] dead yeah I

1908
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,000
can go into the Italian stuff cuz I'm an

1909
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,838
Italian brand right we can go down that

1910
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,559

1942
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,640
was never really impressed with the

1943
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,600
flower with the Donnie Burger I was like

1944
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,600
it's all right I got

1945
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,880
some well he' given me a bag of flour

1946
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,520
and he's like it's so good you got to

1947
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,960
try it and sometimes when people say

1948
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,560
that they you're under impressed with it

1949
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,640
like I was I was expecting something

1950
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,600
else cuz I'm like GMO you got to like

1951
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,279
GMO though right I do like GMO okay got

1952
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,359
you got you got you but when he gave it

1953
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:52,159
to me I was like eh it's all right it

1954
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,000
was cool it's living soil so sometimes

1955
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:56,439
living soil you know I think there's a

1956
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,920
learning curve with it with or whatever

1957
01:08:56,439 --> 01:09:00,798
no doubt he gave me some rosin Chris

1958
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,960
from flora and Flame gave me

1959
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:08,198
some and freaking it is phenomenal it is

1960
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:11,239
some of the best rosin d i was judging

1961
01:09:08,198 --> 01:09:15,000
the can ofest rosin entries and I use a

1962
01:09:11,238 --> 01:09:17,479
turp uh freaking nectar collector for

1963
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,719
entries for feel like I can go side by

1964
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:21,198
side so I do my little I I first taste

1965
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:22,880
them all then I line them up in order

1966
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,678
and then I go okay number one versus

1967
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,279
number two number two versus number

1968
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:29,039
three and I keep going back and until

1969
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,199
it's down to the order that I have and

1970
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,158
then I write down all the different

1971
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:34,158
things I like about him but I usually

1972
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,079
try to put him in order like that well

1973
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,158
his wasn't in the can of Fest entries

1974
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:38,920
and I think he would have won first

1975
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:41,679
place no [ __ ] that Donnie B and there

1976
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,000
was another Donnie Burger entry in there

1977
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,560
I'm pretty sure one of the other ones

1978
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,238
was Donnie Burger but I have some GMO we

1979
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,239
went GMO to Donnie burger and you could

1980
01:09:47,238 --> 01:09:52,639
totally tell the GMO is in there oh yeah

1981
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,599
um but yeah it's it's nice it's got It's

1982
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,800
got this

1983
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,960
amazing uh lightly floral character with

1984
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,719
this heavy gas and I feel like it's one

1985
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,880
of those ones that the good rosin just

1986
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:05,439
coats your It Coats your teeth even

1987
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,679
you're like flossing and you're like oh

1988
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:10,559
yeah you you tast it in your floss that

1989
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:12,158
night if you take mouth coat man now

1990
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,920
when you're doing a nectar collector

1991
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:17,319
like are you checking temps or you just

1992
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:19,760
just sizzling on it I do I or you have a

1993
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:21,119
process second I know I I basically just

1994
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,320
heat them up a little bit cuz I'm I'm

1995
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,479
all about the cold sh dabs anyway so

1996
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:30,039
normally you know I use my ays I use my

1997
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:31,559
Carta the the focus V Carta 2 okay uh

1998
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:34,158
and then I can set my temps with that I

1999
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:36,080
quit using the rigs I have a ton of rigs

2000
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,799
but I'm I don't use rigs anymore and I

2001
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:39,198
got into them a lot this year dude

2002
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,520
really I I'll probably get back into it

2003
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:42,719
it's one of those things that goes but I

2004
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:45,840
I do like the convenience of a digital

2005
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:48,158
and electronic device and it's just more

2006
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,719
convenient and same thing with dude I

2039
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,480
a lot about him on the first smoke

2040
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,920
episode I always knew the brother's name

2041
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:56,919
I used to hear his name in Jersey like

2042
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,399
yeah yeah yeah Kyle Kush everybody knows

2043
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,039
Kyle I was lucky to get him on the

2044
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:04,079
episode I it was a really good we shot

2045
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:06,119
back and forth uh when our guests talk

2046
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:07,639
fast I talk fast and then it like we get

2047
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:09,679
that energy going you know especially

2048
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:11,560
you start smoking and then you just feed

2049
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,880

2168
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,880
everything so for sure we had one of

2169
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:38,560
their guests which was from Mother's

2170
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:41,239
Magnolia in Oregon okay and they're in

2171
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,280
Eugene and this guy swears by it he

2172
01:16:41,238 --> 01:16:45,479
grows amazing flower so I've heard and I

2173
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:47,279

really cool stuff in Oregan and he

2176
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,360

2177
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,800

sometimes and this is one of those ones

2181
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,839

01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,560

another copycat of something else you're

2205

2673
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:15,679
small handful small handful small

2674
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:17,520
handful coffin candy though that's

2675
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:21,000
that's the one I really like that coffin

2676
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:24,080
candy I think that or the 11 coffins

2677
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,719
that's probably the best thing I smoke

2678
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:28,039
this year yeah right off the top of my

2679
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:29,760
head I mean there's definitely the sour

2680
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:31,600
diesel that I got again that that you

2681
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,320
got to try some on give some that's

2682
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,880
special so my friend Dave from balero

2683
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:37,559
we're gonna do a drop we're talking

2684
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,600
about doing a drop with the sour and

2685
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:42,560
then if it works well we're GNA continue

2686
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:45,360
to do drops with old school land race

2687
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:47,400
different stuff he's from Mendo he's

2688
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:48,880
like an unknown dude who's who's really

2689
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:50,039
passionate and he you know I mean I

2690
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:53,400
would say he's known within his

2691
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:55,479
community a lot but he is I think he's

2692
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:57,960
ready to come out and share his story

2693
01:34:55,479 --> 01:34:59,919
and share his brand with the world and

2694
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:02,319
he's all he got African black Haze

2695
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:05,039
that's amazing some Nigerian Haze fire

2696
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:07,319
bro I've tried some it's similar to piff

2697
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:08,920
it is a little stronger though man I

2698
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:10,319
think so too and it's one of those ones

2699
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,840
I feel like when you smoke it there's

2700
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:13,359
certain it's a creeper some of these

2701
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,600
ones are creepers right like you smoke

2702
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:16,880
it and like it slowly lifts you up and

2703
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,079
then a lot of times you think you're

2704
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,239
only going to be so high and you just

2705
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:21,920
keep getting more High yeah so and I

2706
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:23,439
like that I like that sometimes as long

2707
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,600
as I'm not on the podcast doing that

2708
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:27,599
yeah right [ __ ] dude that reminds me of

2709
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,159
back in the day bro like when yo it's

2710
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,840
creeper weed watch out yeah I remember

2711
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:33,559
like the real good weed would creep on

2712
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,480
you sometimes for 15 minutes and then

2713
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,199
you're like feeling the full effect

2714
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:39,678
especially we used to take big fat bong

2715
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:41,638
ramps we had like a 4 foot bong and so

2716
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,319
we do huge bong RS out of this thing and

2717
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:44,840
like that would get you high right away

2718
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:46,359
but if you smoke some creeper you would

2719
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:49,920
just keep getting more High your eyes

2720
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:53,799

I'm past that whole surprise stage with

2746
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,679
my stuff when we're testing stuff it's

2747
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,000
like is it good is it bad and we're

2748
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:58,639
doing some trials with different

2749
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:01,439
products I'm doing some uh really good

2750
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:04,480
stuff with Char cor so we're doing Char

2751
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:06,960
cor Kaa and Ka and I feel like I already

2752
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:09,238
know the Char cor performs really well

2753
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:11,560
ka's proven itself and now it's like

2754
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:13,359
okay let's see with Cana we're gonna do

2755
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,840
a test nice we'll see how they perform

2756
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:16,960
and they're all slightly different

2757
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:19,800
different consistencies different you

2758
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,079
know and I think Ka is doing a 7030 now

2759
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,679
charc cor is doing about to have a 7030

2760
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:26,279
hit the market nice uh or either that or

2761
01:37:24,679 --> 01:37:27,760
they already have it but I'm I think

2762
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:29,399
that's an interesting approach for it

2763
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,280
and then can's like the original ka's

2764
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:32,198
been there forever yeah so I'm big fan

2765
