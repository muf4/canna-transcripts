00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,780
large library of knowledge that I've got

18

kind of figured out what the practical

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,379
application for a lot of the Sciences

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,460
for some of these different

24
00:00:57,378 --> 00:01:01,878
processes that are happening in nature

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,920
and how we can apply them into uh

26
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,959
systems and uh

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,840
replicate that and show it on data

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,478

I've been cultivating since about 2001

34
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,298
2002 right around there you know I got

35
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,739
into it because

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:37,500
uh some of my dad's younger homies which

37
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,759
were my older homies kind of brought me

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,540
under their wing and they had already

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,400
been ground for a couple of years and uh

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,020
I was just doing a bunch of [ __ ]

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,359
working with those guys they were having

42
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,039
me like mow their yard and wash their

43
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,840
dog and I was just a kid back then you

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,979
know I was a teenager

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,899
and uh you know washing hydrocorn Rock

46
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:59,879
and [ __ ] so they could reuse it in their

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,379
Hydro System doing stuff like that and I

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,780
knew what they were doing but they kind

49
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,640
of tested me I did it for a while before

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,799
I ever got to see the inside of a garden

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,618
so I was kind of like it's kind of like

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,480
their little [ __ ]

53
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:13,500
approach some karate kid Mr Miyagi

54
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,598
approach

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,239
it it really was dude they kind of

56
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,939
tested me they wanted to see if I was

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,700
willing to put in the work

58
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,800
um and they were also also being

59
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,019
cautious because they wanted to [ __ ]

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,280
protect their own asses hey I have a

61
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,400
interesting story because I actually

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,479
grew up in foster care but I met my

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,640
father who was who got sent to prison in

64
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,979
96 and he's still in prison

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,779
but I got in touch with him through my

66
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,598
um my mom after uh

67
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,219
I became an adult when I turned 18.

68
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,619
and

69
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,019
uh he basically was like hey go meet

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,099
some of my friends you know and so I did

71
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,459
and that's kind of how those

72
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,378
relationships built uh so they knew who

73
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,420
I was but they you know they couldn't

74
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,899
vouch for me back then you know I was

75
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,719
just uh I was just some [ __ ] punk kid

76
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,760
you know and so I I you know I did all

77
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,500
the things and I worked worked my way in

78
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,719
and I got to know the guys and they

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,860
finally brought me and uh first thing I

80
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,620
actually did

81
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,140
when they brought me in was

82
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,539
um I cut open a galvanized steel conduit

83
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,878
to steal power because one of them was

84
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,259
an actual electrician

85
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,780
so he knew how to do all the electric

86
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,299
work but uh he needed wires to clamp

87
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,098
onto so uh that's all that's the first

88
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,540
thing that I that like really got me in

89
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,280
there because after I did that they were

90
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,280
like I mean they paid me like two grand

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,039
I was super [ __ ] stoked I was like

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,419
yeah this is such a come up dude I was

93
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,959
you know because I

94
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:48,298
that was like at the time probably uh

95
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,819
you know one of the times where I just

96
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,439
got a big ass chunk of change while I

97
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,419
was like [ __ ] yeah dude I just got

98
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,459
[ __ ] paid two G's right there okay

99
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,899
cool yeah that's like 10 grand in

100
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,500
today's terms

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,939
yeah so

102
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,400
um yeah but I started working with those

103
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,400
guys I worked with those guys uh Dirty

104
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,019
Harry and triple D down in San Diego uh

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,879
they actually are the ones who created

106
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,680
The Afghani bull rider not to be

107
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,298
confused with the original bull rider

108
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,280
but this was um

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,560
the original bull ride across to an

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,279
Afghan and we ran that from probably

111
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,019
about 2001 to real hard until about 2009

112
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,679
but I worked with them for about two

113
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,539
years then I had my own partners that I

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,900
worked with and had you know different

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,699
grows here and there and you know got

116
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,719
into trouble went to prison a couple

117
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,020
times

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,100
wow I ended up you know every time I was

119
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,379
locked up I was like I gotta get the

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,300
hell out of California this place and as

121
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:47,759
soon as I did everything kind of changed

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,680
I got out here to Oklahoma I I started

123

that I had started in San Diego and

126
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:58,939
Incorporated it out here and I've been

127
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:03,360
able to really focus in on the Cannabis

128
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:05,819
Agronomy and microbiology side and you

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,740
know taking a look at the cultivation

130
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,360
system holistically

131
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,680
well everything from you know

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,780
biosecurity and integrated Pest

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,639
Management to

134
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,519
um soil fertility health and management

135
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,680
data collection environmental you know

136
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,359
management or you know everything that

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,180
we do in

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,060
cannabis cultivation nice and so then

139
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,780
tell us about uh bukashi Earthworks

140
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,560
oh it initially started with I went on

141
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:36,239
to this Facebook book group in like 2014

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,339
it was called the probiotic Farmers

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,819
Alliance and they were talking about

144
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:44,939
you know soil microbiology and about you

145
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:48,180
know bokashi which is usually a like a

146
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:50,339
fermented organic waste that you that

147
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,900
you can use as basically a bio

148
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,758
fertilizer

149
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,258
so there's a whole group that was

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,300
dedicated and that that group still

151
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,939
exists my knowledge it sparked my

152
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,418
interest and I was at a time

153
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:05,219
this was around 2014 when the price of

154
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,139
cannabis started to really drop because

155
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,340
when we started we were selling pounds

156
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,400
for forty eight hundred dollars a pound

157
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,739
or 300 an ounce all the way up no matter

158
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,839
how much you got like it didn't matter

159
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,538
that was the price and people were

160
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,459
willing to pay it and then we would you

161
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,019
know go to Northern California to the

162
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,659
people that would be running diesel

163
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,299
generators and they'd have like 200 or

164
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,220
200 likes which we couldn't really bust

165
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,100
that big we had multiple houses we'd

166
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,600
have like 12 lights here maybe like four

167
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,600
lights over here another four lights

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,060
over here uh but we would go pick up

169
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,580
like larger packs up in uh Northern

170
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,379
California and bring those down and

171
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:45,599
but uh

172
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,680
the prices started to decrease over time

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,199
and I remember specifically it was

174
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,478
2014 I was in San Diego and all the uh

175
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,400
the way that they did like the

176
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,439
permitting you couldn't like

177
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,299
you could get uh like a dispensary

178
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,339
license but it wouldn't be like zone so

179
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,020
you would just get fine

180
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,119
and so people were just like okay cool

181
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,500
we'll just take fine so all these shops

182
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,840
started popping up and then everybody

183
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,120
started cultivating and it was like and

184
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,459
the landscape started to change

185
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,139
that's the like the like the period for

186
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:19,680
me when I really started noticing it

187
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,819
because pounds were at like 25 or 2 400

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,459
dollars

189
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,098
and I was like damn dude I was like I

190
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,899
wonder if it's gonna you know like it

191
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:30,300
left me in a place thinking like okay

192
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,918
I'm gonna have to rethink like the way

193
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,020
that I'm doing this because I need to

194
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,879
decrease my overhead

195
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,918
um that's what actually drove me into

196
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,939
Organics it was because I wanted to

197
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,859
figure out how to reduce my my overhead

198
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,000
and

199
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,800
um you know

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,439
I just went for it because I was like

201
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
let's let's try it I delved into some of

202
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,519
the the

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,740
the Bro Science I guess I looked at a

204
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,459
lot of the old recipes like

205
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,900
uh sub cool recipe and Coots recipe and

206
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,659
you know different

207
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,459
recipes that I could find online I

208
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,419
didn't have a great success and I was

209
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,418
running

210
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,978
um you know I ran the two gallon ebb and

211
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,899
flow buckets you know with the hydrocorn

212
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:14,939
rocks and the little you know little

213
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,318
four lighter pattern Checker and some of

214
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:17,219
the you know I remember the first the

215
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,439
first

216
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,960
um grow that we ever did it was a four

217
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,839
bedroom house and the whole place was

218
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,180
converted had three 4 000 watt flowering

219
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,378
rooms a thousand watt bedroom and we'd

220
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,660
be pulling out

221
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,379
36 plants

222
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,120
in for every room every like two weeks

223
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,038
or something like that you know and we

224
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,918
had a little checkerboard metal halide

225
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:44,179
HPS doing the ebb and flow and I did

226
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:46,439
that same exact system for like 11 years

227
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,838
and I ran

228
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,300
I think I ran General

229
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:55,620
uh three-part General with some like

230
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:57,958
maybe some additives here and there

231
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,820
I did that part by itself was good

232
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,939
though I mean I think a lot of us grew

233
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,440
up using three-part for for the time

234
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,300
that was what a lot of us had to work

235
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,220
with it was good though I mean we were

236
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,740
doing the same thing we had our BR or

237
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,139
Hannah meter that was like the size of a

238
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,080
brick you know and it was like they're

239
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:19,259
indestructible yeah we'd be still

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,019
measuring our ppms measuring our our pH

241
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,939
and topping off our rezies and all that

242
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,860
[ __ ] you know it's I ended up like

243
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,959
losing a whole room because like the AC

244
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,278
failed or like a pump failed I don't

245
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,199
even know what it was but it was like

246
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,179
something mechanical in the room failed

247
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,879
and it was like [ __ ] whole room went

248
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:37,679
down lost it and I was like [ __ ] like

249
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,379
this [ __ ] sucks dude that's like

250
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,899
thousands of dollars thousands of

251
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,399
[ __ ] dollars that were [ __ ] lost

252
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,320
you know and so

253
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,399
um I ended up kind of just switching

254
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,420
over to

255
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,899
like potting mix but I was still running

256
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:58,319
uh I was still running newts you know

257
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:01,259
and I did that for like a year before I

258
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,760
switched out completely over to organic

259
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,980
and and I had to relearn everything

260
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,439
because once I started trying to build

261
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,720
soils and like figure it out

262
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,700
all right dude I I was like I don't know

263
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,200
what the [ __ ] I'm doing like I gotta

264
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,759
figure this out that's what that's

265
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,399
basically what happened I've been doing

266
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,559
a certain thing that worked really

267
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,240
really well but once I like changed up

268
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,179
the protocol

269
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,919
and like veered from something else it

270
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,259
was like I had to relearn and like

271
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,479
understand the science and what I was

272
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,860
like why do I need to add this why do I

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,459
need to add this what's you know and

274
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,560
finding out all the the nuances of what

275
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:40,559
elements are there for what and what how

276
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:43,199
the levels of where those should be in

277
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,958
accordance to you know total soluble

278
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,220
nutrition of that nutrient in the soil

279
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,699
right

280
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,220
so you went to school for um Agronomy or

281
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,360
did you was that later or you you're all

282
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,879
self-taught

283
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,480
no I'm all self-taught so

284
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,379
um

285
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,360
what I ended up doing was I started to

286
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,399
before I ever got into the commercial

287
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
side of cultivation

288
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,259
I was doing soil testing because I

289
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,199
wanted to understand

290
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:15,179
uh the you know the soil levels I I

291
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,019
wanted to try to figure that out so I

292
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,039
could like you know create a program

293
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,860
that was

294
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,259
that was basically organic that was all

295
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,200
organic that I could Implement into a

296
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,958
program a complete program and not have

297
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,759
to guess at you know because it here's

298
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,439
the issue like

299
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,319
I've always been able to grow a great

300
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,640
week but if I have an issue

301
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,660
that

302
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:46,919
like let's say appears during week for a

303
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:49,559
flower and I am addressing it as that uh

304
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,259
deficiency symptom appears or that or

305
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,879
whatever that symptom of whatever it

306
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,338
might be appears

307
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,399
by the time that symptom appears we're

308
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:02,040
already probably about 50 percent into

309
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,940
like a deficiency for example so if I'm

310
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,159
like

311
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,680
running my plants and all of a sudden

312
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,000
dude everything's [ __ ] getting yellow

313
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,519
at the bottoms and I'm running out of

314
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,720
nitrogen it's like oh [ __ ] uh that I

315
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,120
shouldn't be doing I shouldn't be

316
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,399
running out of nitrogen I want to know

317
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,500
how much I should have had in that

318
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,299
system at the beginning

319
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,240
so that we're not running out through

320
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:27,419
the system so that we we can do

321
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,159
you know basic you know soil builds that

322
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:32,819
contain the proper amount of nutrition

323
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:34,740
that'll allow us to do very very minimal

324
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,680
maintenance and get

325
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,680
great results not just quality but that

326
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,899
can compete on the quantity side as well

327
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,699
right and consistency so every time you

328
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,958
do it you get the same results or

329
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,120
similar results

330
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,518
yeah and so here's the thing so like

331
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,519
when whenever we're running a program or

332
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,659
like anybody people that I work with

333
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,700
so

334
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:58,799
in the in the in the instance that

335
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,120
they're using my soil my soil comes

336
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,219
built it already meets the target

337
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,860
nutritional levels that are built for

338
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,920
cannabis so I've I already know what

339
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,379
they are as far as the total amount of

340
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,360
nutrition that needs to be in soil how

341
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:13,860
it falls into solution and when we're

342
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,740
looking at how we do that we're looking

343
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,379
at standard soil tests and then a

344
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,600
saturated Pace test so a standard test

345
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,879
will show you collectively what's in the

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,820
soil and then a saturated Pace test

347
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,519
allows you to see every single element

348
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,019
in the parts per million that's falling

349
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:36,959
into solution so as you water that soil

350
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:39,419
as the the mineral ions that the plant

351
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,239
observes the mineral nutrition whether

352
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:47,159
it's the phosphate anion or the divalent

353
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,399
form of calcium magnesium potassium any

354
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:53,219
of those things they all uh they fall

355
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,019
into the solution right and they're

356
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,180
uptaken in or diffuse across the

357
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,659
membranes with the water

358
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,638
and we can actually look at all of the

359
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,980
mineral ions that are in the water with

360
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,700
the saturated paste test so instead of

361
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,860
just looking at the EC and the PPM

362
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,139
I can look at

363
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,360
those two factors plus I can look at

364
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,240
every single individual individual

365
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,879
element I can look at phosphorus and

366
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,278
calcium and potassium and I can also

367
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,720
look at all my secondary all my

368
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,059
micronutrients I can look at things that

369
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,639
are antagonistic like bicarbonate and

370
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,619
sodium and chloride and things that I

371
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,959
know if they're going to be high in soil

372
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,419
is going to cause antagonisms in that

373
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,879
system can be out of balance if those

374
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,000
those things are too high so I'm able to

375
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,338
look at different types of data on soil

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,399
and be able to determine what I need to

377
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:51,120
add into that soil if I don't meet a

378
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:55,078
Target on that solution so if my target

379
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,778
PPM is between 8 and 1000 PPM and then

380
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:01,799
let's say calcium is between 150 and 200

381
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:06,360
PPM and magnesium is between 32 and 40

382
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:10,019
PPM and uh potassium is between

383
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,519
um 125 and 150 PPM right and we're

384
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,500
looking at all of these different

385
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,959
elements in the actual amount of

386
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,500
availability I know all those targets

387
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:22,739
right so if we're looking at a soil and

388
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:26,159
it's not meeting that Target I know what

389
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,560
I need to add of what certain element to

390
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,458
bring that Target up to a sufficient

391
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,439
level

392
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,419
so if if someone had a soil and they

393
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,220
came to me and they're like hey can you

394
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:37,559
do a test for me and I can look at their

395
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,778
soil I could look at their pH I could pH

396
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,419
balance it I could and let's say it's

397
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:45,419
only a 400 parts per million total

398
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:47,399
soluble salts and everything's just kind

399
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:48,659
of low I can look at that soil and say

400
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,958
this is what you're going to need to add

401
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,639
in in the exact quantity to be able to

402
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,919
balance the soil out and so what I've

403
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,259
done is I've provided you know those

404
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,240
types of services to the people that I

405
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,220
work with and then I also provide them

406
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,980
with all of those individual base

407
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,879
elements so most people will buy a

408
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,980
branded Pro product right like I do have

409
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,958
branded products because I take all the

410
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,820
stuff that we're buying in bulk and I

411
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,859
distribute this for like home Growers

412
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,560
and stuff but like when I'm working with

413
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,659
commercial producers I'm selling them 50

414
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,719
pound bags you know and they're very

415
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:26,759
cost effective because if you buy a bag

416
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,639
of magnesium sulfate and that's pretty

417
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,799
much your sole source for magnesium

418
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,419
it's going to be very very efficient to

419
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,819
be able to get that into that system

420
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,919
it's very soluble you can also use it in

421
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,639
the foiler spray and it's only about

422
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,379
maybe 25 bucks for a 50 pound bag

423
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,519
right you know and that so that's going

424
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,838
to last you know a commercial producer a

425
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,240
long time

426
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,579
just that small amount you know and so

427
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,379
the larger you scale if you're buying in

428
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,958
bulk these things get even cheaper and

429
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,698
so it becomes you're basically operating

430
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:04,198
the same way that uh

431
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:06,480
conventional agriculture but you're

432
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,298
using organic amendments you know you're

433
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,220
using natural like organic amendments

434
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:15,179
and natural minerals you know things

435
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,279
like Epsom salt or gypsum gypsum is you

436
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,740
know calcium sulfate now that is

437
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,779
considered a salt but it's natural it

438
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,179
just they it just

439
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,818
in their abundance you can pull it out

440
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,740
with a front loader and then they just

441
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:31,259
micronize it to make it soluble you know

442
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,240
they crush it up so it's not treated in

443
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,919
any way it's just kind of pulled out of

444
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,900
the ground and crushed and then like

445
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,600
here you go here's this mineral so we

446
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,600
have you know complete lists of what we

447
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,519
can use as far as mineral inputs for

448
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,500
different elements and so I try to stick

449
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,240
with single use elements to address

450
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,538
single elements that need to be

451
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,000
addressed so as far as testing

452
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:56,160
um and all this started if we go a step

453
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,839
back you started this as something it

454
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,279
was you were doing it for yourself and

455
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,558
then it evolved into a business where

456
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,899
you're helping others yeah well I was

457
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,119
always producing cannabis to support

458
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,759
myself that was what I that you know

459
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,219
that's what I did for forever

460
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:14,220
you know and I still grow weed at home

461
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,440
and [ __ ] you know what I mean right but

462
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,600
so it's always been a business but it

463
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,038
was always just you know

464
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,379
[ __ ]

465
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:25,140
you know slanging weed to the [ __ ]

466
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,900
homeboys and people that have run that

467
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,820
are running delivery services and you

468
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,000
know you know how it goes dude we're

469
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:35,579
just we're trapping

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,720
yeah so but this has evolved into a real

471
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:41,639
business uh you know because when I got

472
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,460
into the commercial side and people were

473
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,380
looking at me to like hey like we need

474
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,759
to like make sure I like I need to make

475
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,200
sure I have to collect data somehow I

476
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,200
need to be able to replicate the system

477
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,779
over and over and over again right and

478
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,759
so that's what drove me even harder on

479
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,859
the Agronomy because before I got into

480
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,960
the commercial space or the legal space

481
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:03,119
out here in Oklahoma

482
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,579
because I'm originally from San Diego

483
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,439
but uh before I got into the the legal

484
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:09,178
space I was already testing and I was

485
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,700
already like looking into it and playing

486
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,798
around with it but it was like I really

487
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,038
hit it hard and started learning started

488
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,918
getting books started you know taking a

489
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,900
uh Agronomy courses and things of that

490
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,538
so I could really really educate myself

491
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,298
and really understand

492
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,099
the the not just the soil science but

493
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:30,660
actually like the what do I need to add

494
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:32,759
in which quantities because that's what

495
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,580
Agronomy really is it's being able to

496
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,558
unlock the key to the castle if if you

497
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:38,899
only have

498
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,720
you know

499
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,160
75 PPM of calcium how much uh gypsum do

500
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,220
you need to add into that system to

501
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,900
bring it up to 150 right I know what

502
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,880
though all those are and I built like

503
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,400
calculators that can all do it automated

504
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,660
for me now but

505
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,400
it it's figuring all that out and then

506
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,440
and then putting it to practical use

507
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,380
because if you have a Target level for

508
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,120
cannabis right that starts with testing

509
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,039
that was done out of the 70s and there's

510
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,379
a book called plant analysis handbook

511
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,298
which is where the information comes

512
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,740
from like it started off with the leaf

513
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,660
tissue analysis and like what the

514
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,819
percentage of calcium should be what the

515
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,220
percentage of nitrogen be all those

516
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:23,220
elements you can get a baseline because

517
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,360
we can do not just the soil testing but

518
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,759
we can do

519
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,038
the leaf tissue analysis and if we know

520
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,759
we're hitting the specific Targets on

521
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,200
our saturated pace and it's equating to

522
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,480
the right percentage that we're looking

523
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,058
for in tissue then we know those are the

524
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,819
right levels but we can also look at

525
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:43,440
like the overall health like and if

526
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:46,079
you're not guessing and you know like

527
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,058
how to grow good weed to begin with and

528
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,759
you can map something out

529
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:52,859
you can see what it's like to be able to

530
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,839
push those targets and see what the

531
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,678
standard Target is that's been that's

532
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,519
been

533
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,340
um published in literature versus like

534
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,319
what your healthiest crop looks like you

535
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:07,220
know oh hey I have

536
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:10,558
you know six percent calcium versus the

537
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,240
three three and a half that they suggest

538
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,160
you know because they're Cal I think the

539
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,519
calcium was like 2.2 to

540
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,980
uh three three point one percent calcium

541
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,660
uh if you're looking at that book if my

542
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,240
memory serves me

543
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,340
but it's like ideally I see that like

544
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,640
four and a half to five and a half

545
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:31,980
is is better but I've seen all the way

546
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,659
up to like eight percent in and seen

547
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,179
plants that were massive and they were

548
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,460
just crushing right so you know that you

549
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,980
can you can learn stuff from the data

550
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,259
too like understanding that it's that

551
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,740
you can almost not get too much calcium

552
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:48,839
it's just that that calcium does have

553
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,659
antagonisms especially with phosphorus

554
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,759
and other cations and so delivering too

555
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:56,280
much might upsell upset the nutrient

556
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,079
balance but if you can keep giving it to

557
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,980
it you know it's not going to have a

558
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,139
negative

559
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,240
consequence like I don't think anybody's

560
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,840
ever complained about calcium toxicity

561
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,058
you know right for sure so uh data

562
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,158
points you collect a lot of data points

563
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:12,720
sounds like you collect a bunch it's

564
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,919
it's one of the topics that I keep going

565
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
back to on my shows with different

566
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,759
people is like collecting data points

567
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,158
whether you're developing your palette

568
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,019
or you're you know looking at what

569
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,299
potential problems are or how to improve

570
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:27,179
your soil I think data points are

571
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:29,639
everything you know in life in life in

572
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,900
general you want to improve data points

573
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,059
of the way to do it

574
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,940
well and think about it from a business

575
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:37,798
perspective too if you cannot sit down

576
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,779
and say hey these are the targets that

577
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,519
we're reaching for this is you know the

578
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,200
soil that I'm about to give you this is

579
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,658
what we've you know and be able to show

580
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,600
them and say Here's the data here's how

581
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,280
this thing functions and works as a

582
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,199
whole and you can map it out and you can

583
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,779
replicate it over and over again that's

584
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,360
what people want to see so they can have

585
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:59,099
that assurance and confidence that

586
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,519
they're going to be able to run a

587
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:04,558
program that's data driven that is going

588
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,579
to be replicable over and over and over

589
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,619
so they can not so much have to bump uh

590
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:13,139
focus on trying to address deficiencies

591
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:16,199
or try to figure stuff in the back end

592
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,780
of their grow when they can be focusing

593
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,900
more on their brand and their marketing

594
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:24,720
and their distribution and their taxes

595
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,880
and their you know metric if they have

596
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,579
metric you know they're reporting all

597
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,200
the stuff that's included in these

598
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:35,339
vertically integrated business models so

599
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,860
the you know ideally that the the thing

600
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,899
is to reduce overhead

601
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:41,639
by using these types of systems and a

602
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,500
good example of this is if you were to

603
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,419
take something like

604
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,279
let's take a a farm I'm not going to

605
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,460
mention the name out in New Mexico that

606
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,119
I visited they had one Greenhouse

607
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,740
that was 80 000 square feet okay and

608
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,019
they were all running cocoa in two

609
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,700
gallon pots now at the end of their

610
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,879
they were doing terrible by the way but

611
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,440
at the end of their run what they do is

612
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,900
they cut all their plant matter they

613
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,700
removed that they remove all of the

614
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,440
fertigation lines from their pots they

615
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,360
take all those pots they dump all of

616
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,580
their cocoa in a pile someone would

617
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,439
they'd pay to have that cocoa removed

618
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,058
from the facility

619
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,919
and then they'd go wash all those

620
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:21,359
buckets they'd go refill them with cocoa

621
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,759
they'd go reset them on the table hook

622
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,939
up all the fertigation lines right

623
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,279
so that's a massive amount of Labor in a

624
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,038
soil system you would be cutting down

625
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,899
the material removing it for uh drying

626
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,700
and curing then you would be going in

627
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,220
there you would top draw you would you

628
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,019
would test your soil be pre-harvest to

629
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,200
get it to the lab because it takes five

630
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,179
days for the lab analytics to come back

631
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,279
and then you can get a recipe that

632
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,780
basically says what needs to be added to

633
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,480
that soil to bring it back up to

634
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:53,819
nutritional sufficiency so basically

635
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,819
what you do is you harvest

636
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,918
you top dress you plant back into that

637
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:01,740
media and then you run your program

638
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,720
again and so you're not it's less labor

639
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,460
intensive and it's more cost effective

640
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,319
because you're not also

641
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:13,200
using a bunch of uh fertigation salts

642
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,298
like synthetics that have really low

643
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,798
nutrient use efficiency only about 10

644
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:18,900
percent of what you're putting in there

645
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,119
actually is a is observed by the plant

646
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,798
and that's why you have to constantly

647
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,939
feed over and that's why there's so much

648
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,579
waste

649
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,900
now in these types of systems you have

650
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:29,158
better nutrient use efficiency

651
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,200
especially if you're using something

652
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,880
like a smart carbon human fertilizers

653
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,980
and you're and you're using top dress

654
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,240
nutrients because you're addressing

655
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,839
carbon

656
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,298
that holds on to plant mineral ions and

657
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,500
deliver them into solution and you can

658
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:45,418
see how they're delivering them into

659
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,220
solution to the data and we're not just

660
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,840
looking at pH and EC and temperature but

661
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,000
we can look at every single plant

662
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,579
mineral ion and adjust it based off of

663
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,159
what we add into that soil based off of

664
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:58,798
that top dress but it's just less labor

665
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,200
intensive it's more cost effective

666
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,359
and so it's about

667
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,759
you know Bringing Down the production

668
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,019
costs for people because look here's the

669
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,419
thing dude

670
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:10,980
when we're talking about cannabis it's

671
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,440
become an agricultural commodity

672
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,319
regardless of whether it's craft

673
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,659
you're using it for medicinal or adult

674
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,399
use it doesn't really matter anymore

675
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:23,039
because now it's become so

676
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,600
commercialized and the only way that the

677
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,819
small guy is going to be able to take

678
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:30,359
advantage of this is going to be able to

679
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:32,220
by decreasing their overhead just like a

680
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,740
you know small sustainable Farms do

681
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,600
right how do we do that in cannabis well

682
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,700
we need to start by reducing our

683
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,038
overhead reducing our inputs reducing

684
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,380
our water usage our nutrient inputs

685
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,538
reducing our labor costs

686
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,659
those are all things that are all

687
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:51,658
possible to do and scale with these

688
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,700
types of systems and it allows people to

689
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:56,278
focus on the business side because it's

690
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,200
so difficult to to run a small business

691
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,240
because there's so much competition you

692
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,519
have to have good marketing and you have

693
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,500
to have good sales and distribution and

694
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,418
then you also have to worry about all

695
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,099
the back-end business stuff I know as a

696
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,500
business person you know that you're

697
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:13,439
accounting and you're bookkeeping and

698
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,859
your taxes and your reporting and dude

699
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,798
that's so important man right which it's

700
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:21,178
just about making it easy dude

701
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,798
simplifying it and making it easy yeah

702
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,900
for sure

703
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,918
yeah it's not easy to run a business I

704
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,919
mean I think

705
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,840
growing cannabis isn't easy but your

706
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,700
business on top of that is like a whole

707
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,439
nother thing because I feel like and

708
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,940
it's not typically you're not just you

709
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,400
have one person they're not doing it all

710
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,278
you got you got several people you know

711
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,259
we all in like my business we we all

712
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,538
wear many hats but there's still several

713
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,240
people and we all work synergistically

714
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,859
together and it's it's not easy these

715
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,058
days and the price of cannabis has been

716
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:53,579
low I think there's been a lot of people

717
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:55,740
struggling and so yeah lowering the cost

718
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:57,298
of your inputs being as efficient as

719
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,099
possible is going to guarantee you

720
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:00,240
success for years to come if you do it

721
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:02,519
right

722
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,400
yeah and so that's you know that's been

723
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,460
my main focus I work with a lot of

724
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,080
uh independent owner operators I worked

725
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,600
with a lot of people all over the

726
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,000
country but I work with

727
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,619
a really great great group of people

728
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,079
that I'm like close to because they're

729
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:21,479
local to me here in Oklahoma and I even

730
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,038
put together like this craft Farmers

731
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,380
Alliance where I'm just trying to help

732
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,339
get everybody in the same room all

733
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,980
together

734
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,599
so that way we can help with cross

735
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,700
branding and marketing making sure

736
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,879
people aren't growing all the same stuff

737
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,880
trying to compete for shelf space uh

738
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,059
help with you know education when it

739
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,860
comes to the legislation and helping

740
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:45,240
push back against shitty legislation

741
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,819
that they're always trying to push in

742
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,179
cannabis which is like higher taxes more

743
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:54,599
reporting uh you know more you know

744
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,940
increased uh

745
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,219
I could go on and on for sure you know

746
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,140
dude the regulations that basically kill

747
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,538
businesses kill small businesses you

748
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,720
know and it's like they're designed to

749
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:08,519
and and you know and so the thing the

750
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,839
thing is and what I've learned because

751
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,879
I'm right down the street from the

752
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,879
Capitol and I've worked out here with

753
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,159
another guy Jed green and he runs uh

754
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,360
Oklahoma responsible cannabis action and

755
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,799
I've been up to the Capitol several

756
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,599
times and the only people that are up

757
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:24,298
there are people that are representing

758
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,158
business interests right and so there's

759
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,379
no balance there's not anybody

760
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,059
representing independent Independent

761
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,980
Business you know there's not a bunch of

762
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:33,240
independent people that are in business

763
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,500
up there because they're all

764
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,940
independently running their own

765
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,859
businesses

766
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,600
no and it's like they can't go in they

767
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,939
can't go run a business and be at the

768
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,980
Capitol to try to Lobby so that they can

769
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,380
stay in business and it's like this

770
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,700
vicious [ __ ] crazy cycle that like it

771
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,159
doesn't make sense that the average

772
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,460
American person would have to

773
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,380
essentially hire lobbyists just so small

774
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,640
independent operators can function in

775
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,140
this country but that's exactly what's

776
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,840
[ __ ] happening because the only

777
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,940
[ __ ] people that are up there talking

778
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:05,459
to these legislators

779
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,919
our business interests lobbyists

780
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,079
sure yeah I mean there's minimal

781
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,520
representation for the small guy that's

782
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,139
what we try to do is we want to be able

783
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,720
to collectively represent and find

784
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,538
people that'll that'll represent uh us

785
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,480
as a group and not just because look

786
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:23,339
when you are a good operator and you're

787
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,159
transparent with what you do and you

788
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,678
grow good product and you have your skus

789
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,480
lined up and you work with people people

790
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,519
will will come to you you can build a

791
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,740
brand if you have can if you're

792
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,418
consistent and people know what you're

793
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,079
bringing to the table you can build a

794
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,440
brand

795
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,839
sure and I see it all the time but it's

796
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,640
hard dude with all the regulations yeah

797
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,980
I mean I believe the one percent rule so

798
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,960
if you're you know you're in that one

799
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,000
percent you're usually going to be doing

800
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,679
good you want to strive for that you

801
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,898
know that a plus but you want to strive

802
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,059
for that but you know anymore you want

803
00:30:54,898 --> 00:31:00,658
to strive for that point one percent to

804
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:03,178
be really successful yeah so let's dive

805
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,620
into a conversation about cultivars and

806
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,380
we were talking a little earlier before

807
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:09,778
the podcast started about uh you have

808
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:15,179
ways of dialing in specific cultivars

809
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:17,398
cultivar specific nutrition so as you

810
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,440
and I'm sure all your listeners have

811
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:22,798
experience there are a lot of different

812
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,380
nuances with the nutritional needs

813
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,460
between cultivars now a good example of

814
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,260
this is

815
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,960
you know maybe you might have some

816
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:33,480
Afghan dominant variety that doesn't

817
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,278
need as much nitrogen it requires drier

818
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,339
climates doesn't require as much

819
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,679
humidity and you know so you end up kind

820
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:42,599
of seeing that it has some weird things

821
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,100
with calcium that's going on that's a

822
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,959
good example of seeing things that I've

823
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:48,538
seen versus maybe something that's a

824
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,840
more equatorial varietal it grows

825
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:54,000
lengthier longer Intermodal spacing uh

826
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:58,459
narrow Leaf dominant characteristics

827
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,038
that kind of is spindly and requires

828
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:04,558
uh you know maybe a shitload more

829
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,480
calcium to nitrogen ratio to keep them a

830
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,918
little more Stout because of the way

831
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,360
that they've you know kind of tend to

832
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,340
tend to grow

833
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,740
so there's different nuances whatever

834
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:15,740
those nuances may be cultivar dependent

835
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,079
they're usually

836
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:22,200
environmental but also nutritional uh

837
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:24,960
dependent these kind of variances

838
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,580
and so you know we mentioned the the

839
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,440
different types of tests we have what's

840
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:30,480
called a standard soil test and that

841
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,940
gives us just an overall view of what's

842
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,740
in the soil as a total percentage so

843
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,679
we're looking at on that we're looking

844
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,899
at our our four major soil cations which

845
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,820
is going to be calcium magnesium

846
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:45,079
potassium and sodium we want to see

847
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:48,240
calcium around 60 percent magnesium

848
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:51,359
12 to 15 and then for cannabis uh

849
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,220
potassium we want to see uh five to

850
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,898
eight percent and then sodium as low as

851
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,519
possible it's antagonistic to all of

852
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:59,158
those and the right reason why we want

853
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:02,099
to have them in those ratios is because

854
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:07,140
if you have 60 of the soil solution

855
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:09,058
calcium uh 15 or 12 to 15 mag and five

856
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,340
to eight of potassium when you look at

857
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:13,440
the PPM on how they fall into solution

858
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:15,778
the parts per million of that solution

859
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,298
will be balanced and you're going to see

860
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:19,500
kind of what we're we're looking for and

861
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:21,538
so that's what we're looking on that

862
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,640
we're also looking at the amount of

863
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:25,379
total micronutrients that's in that

864
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,840
system overall

865
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,159
and we're looking at nitrogen levels and

866
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,439
then when we're looking at the saturated

867
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,559
Pace we can see how that soil falls into

868
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,538
solution now if let's say everything

869
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,158
meets you know where it's supposed to be

870
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:40,919
and we're meeting those targets we can

871
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,778
also take a look at

872
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,120
um the the leaf tissue and the leaf

873
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:47,038
tissue also has a Target so nitrogen has

874
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,839
a percentage of the leaf that it should

875
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,038
be

876
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,658
potassium magnesium all the

877
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:52,558
micronutrients secondary nutrients all

878
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:55,679
that

879
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,619
and so we can gauge that and if we have

880
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,380
a target for a cultivar and let's say it

881
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,959
is uh between four and a half and five

882
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:07,080
and a half percent in the leaf tissue

883
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,220
calcium and we're meeting our Target

884
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,980
which is let's say it's uh

885
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:15,898
uh 200 PPM of calcium that's the the

886
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,460
target of the parts per million that we

887
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:19,079
want to see on a saturated paste test

888
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,639
because that's basically our nutrient

889
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,460
solution that the plant is going to see

890
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,800
in this soil

891
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,980
if we're seeing it that and it's at 200

892
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,760
PPM but we're only seeing maybe two

893
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,679
percent of calcium in the leaf

894
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,460
we there's a couple of things that we

895
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,679
can

896
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,740
that we can uh

897
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,079
analyze with that so one is calcium is

898
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:46,378
dependent on VPD so it's dependent on

899
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,059
the movement and transport of water

900
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,898
through the plant the reason is is

901
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:51,480
because

902
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:54,239
the plant cannot translocate calcium

903
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,059
from its lower parts to newer growth

904
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,759
to supplement for what it needs for New

905
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:01,440
Growth it needs to be available in

906
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,359
Solution that's why I have such a high

907
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,579
percentage of it percentage of calcium

908
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,799
needs to be in solution it's so that we

909
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,500
can have an abundance of calcium in that

910
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,940
in that leaf so that way we can have all

911
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,039
the signaling molecules it's the

912
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,740
backbone of a lot of the the lignin and

913
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:19,019
cellulose and all uh the other cellular

914
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,578
components when we're looking at that

915
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:23,400
and there's two ways that we can

916
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:27,539
approach it if we're not getting the the

917
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,240
adequate amount of calcium in the tissue

918
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:33,300
but it's meeting that range where it's

919
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:35,219
supposed to be at 200 PPM then we have

920
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,160
to look at the environment because maybe

921
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:40,980
our soil is too dry or VPD is off and so

922
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,659
we're not getting adequate transpiration

923
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,579
and that's what's responsible for

924
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:47,460
calcium because calcium moves in water

925
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:49,560
right it's it's dependent on water

926
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,838
movement so if we don't have

927
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,119
transpiration taking place and water

928
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,858
movement going through the plant the

929
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,480
calcium then calcium isn't going to get

930
00:35:55,858 --> 00:36:00,119
to where it needs to be

931
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,800
we can look at we my immediate would be

932
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,980
oh we need to be looking at BPD because

933
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,200
calcium is highly dependent on VPD so if

934
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,820
we're looking and all our VPD is in

935
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,098
range rates right where it should be

936
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,260
then we know for that particular

937
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:16,260
nutrient we need to increase it so we

938
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,119
need to increase the the nutrient

939
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,640
concentration and the percentage of

940
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,500
calcium on the standard soil so we'll

941
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:27,059
see an increase in the PPM maybe we go

942
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,440
up to 225 PPM or 250 PPM these are

943
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,659
really high levels by the way I don't

944
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,659
recommend this

945
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,759
um 150 to 200 is usually Max for uh

946
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:38,098
calcium

947
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,960
but let's say it is a variety that needs

948
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,940
more of it we could push it by doing

949
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,000
that and then we could take another uh

950
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,858
tissue sample and if we see okay we're

951
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,219
now at that four and a half percent

952
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:52,380
range by increasing the available of

953
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:54,059
availability of calcium then we know

954
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,519
that we've reached our Target goal okay

955
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:58,679
so for this specific cultivar instead of

956
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:02,519
having 200 PPM

957
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:04,440
of calcium we need 250 PPM of calcium

958
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,420
and so to get to that I already know how

959
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,059
much of what element like it might be

960
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,920
calcium silica it might be gypsum it

961
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:13,799
might be oyster shell it might be bone

962
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,139
meal it just depends on the nutrition of

963
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,820
the soil what I'll add to bring it up to

964
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:18,900
that Target level for that specific

965
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,579
variety

966
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,260
and then there's another part of it too

967
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,400
so I can do that for all the different

968
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,920
elements

969
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,599
if nitrogen is low as a percentage and

970
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,300
I'm looking at it to be three percent

971
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,220
it's only one percent then I need then I

972
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,160
know that I need to increase the

973
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:37,618
nitrogen levels for that for that plant

974
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,838
so it works really easy it's just

975
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:42,059
numbers and it's like I already have it

976
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,858
all plugged in like it's it

977
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,779
for me it makes a lot of sense I don't

978
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:47,819
know if I'm explaining it well enough

979
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,560
but

980
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,180
um I can just adjust those levels and

981
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,838
then what we're doing is we're taking an

982
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:57,358
additional test to to see what happens

983
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:58,500
when we've adjusted those levels and

984
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,358
then there's another thing what we can

985
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,800
do is called sap analysis and sap

986
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:03,059
analysis is two different tests where

987
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,740
you're testing fully developed

988
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:07,679
photosynthetic top leaves and fully

989
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:09,659
developed uh photosynthetic with sheer

990
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,059
bottom leaves and it gives a difference

991
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:14,879
in nutrition and it allows you to see

992
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:18,599
how mobile nutrients like magnesium

993
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,619
potassium nitrogen phosphorus how they

994
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,900
move

995
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,460
or if they're being translocated before

996
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,280
they'll ever show as a deficiency

997
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,920
symptom so if you see that like nitrogen

998
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,960
is lower on the bottom than it is on the

999
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,320
top then you know that it's pulling from

1000
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:38,460
the lower to it's not getting enough in

1001
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,320
solution to sat to satisfy both the

1002
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,059
bottom portion and the top portion so

1003
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,180
the plant is actually pulling nutrition

1004
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:47,099
it's catabolizing itself it's uh any

1005
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:49,139
stored amino acids or anything like that

1006
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:52,500
will break those down release nitrogen

1007
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:54,420
and phosphorus and it'll send that up

1008
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,059
into the plant to where the new growth

1009
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,920
needs it right and so you can see that

1010
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:00,900
with a sap analysis because it'll show

1011
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,000
which nutrients are being catabolized at

1012
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,039
the bottom of the plant and being taken

1013
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,260
to the top and so if you're seeing that

1014
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:11,279
nitrogen is lower at the bottom you can

1015
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:13,800
also increase your Target on your uh on

1016
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,140
your saturated Pace test to make sure

1017
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,480
that you have an adequate amount of that

1018
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:20,819
Target nutrient so that way they're

1019
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,099
basically level you want to see on on

1020
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,960
the both the bottom and the top on a

1021
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,400
graph you want to see and be level that

1022
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,260
means that it's not pulling from the

1023
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,700
bottom if the bottom graph is lower it

1024
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,560
means it's pulling from the bottom part

1025
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:33,480
of the plant and here's the thing you

1026
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,759
can look at one of those tests before

1027
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,039
it'll ever show a deficiency symptom and

1028
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,660
preemptively act and so that's one of

1029
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,759
the benefits because if you're

1030
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:44,219
addressing a nitrogen deficiency or

1031
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,680
potassium or phosphorus deficiency

1032
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:50,338
you're usually addressing it after it's

1033
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,858
about 50 already into that deficiency

1034
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:55,019
symptom yeah before it's even observable

1035
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:57,779
you can test get this get a sap test and

1036
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:59,940
you'll be able to to see it yeah have

1037
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,500
you done any sap testing no but I'm

1038
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,500
super interested in it sounds awesome

1039
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:07,320
okay so new age Labs it's kind of a

1040
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,480
complicated process I did it for the I

1041
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,579
did it for two cultivars and like this

1042
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,740
is how I built out the the program

1043
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,539
because I I knew I could do it and I

1044
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:17,699
wanted to test it out

1045
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:20,159
and so

1046
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:23,460
um the process is really complicated but

1047
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:26,338
you're basically taking three or four

1048
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:30,059
standard soil saturated paste Leaf

1049
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:31,980
tissue and sap tests during the span of

1050
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,320
one cultivation cycle so from the

1051
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,119
beginning of edge to the end of flower

1052
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,579
and so you're click you're basically

1053
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,500
taking a data set for a cultivar and

1054
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:43,260
you're mapping it out with all of this

1055
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,639
with all of the the the

1056
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,160
um the data that you're collecting from

1057
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,199
each individual one of those tests but

1058
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:51,358
New Age Labs what you'll do is you take

1059
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,679
like you'd go and take let's say you

1060
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,019
have your Greenhouse right and you want

1061
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:57,480
to test this row that has all you know

1062
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,639
your Sour Diesel in it right sap you'll

1063
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,440
take bottom from all the plant and

1064
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:03,480
you'll categorize that as the bottom

1065
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,800
you'll take all the leaves from the top

1066
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,800
and you'll take like I don't know 80

1067
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,380
grams of each and then you bag them up

1068
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,820
I usually put like paper towels so so

1069
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,160
that way you can seal the bag and not

1070
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,338
have a mold but you ship them next day

1071
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,019
in a little ice chest container and then

1072
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:21,059
they'll then they'll test them like

1073
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,820
within a day and then they'll give you

1074
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,219
an analysis so it's uh

1075
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,039
it's not real time but it's it's it's

1076
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:30,299
pretty efficient one day is pretty good

1077
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,739
yeah

1078
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,000
yeah it's really cool it's really cool

1079
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,699
the way they do it

1080
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,440
that's awesome and and then Logan Labs

1081
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:39,118
is the lab that I use for all my testing

1082
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,559
that's uh there's you know some really

1083
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,599
good books too like there's a book

1084
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,820
called uh the art of balancing soil

1085
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,980
nutrition he's by uh Bill McKibbon he's

1086
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,280
a corn and soil agronomist and he uses

1087
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,079
Logan labs and they have such great

1088
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,240
comprehensive data sets and being able

1089
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,800
to start for anybody who's interested in

1090
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,439
this stuff those that's a really great

1091
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,480
place to start because you can look at

1092
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,760
different types of soil you can look at

1093
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,838
different types of media and like when

1094
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,640
you would want to have frequent low dose

1095
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:11,699
fertigation events for different types

1096
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,559
of soil like in outdoor soils or like

1097
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:14,819
nutrient or soils that hold a lot of

1098
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:16,679
nutrition that you don't need to

1099
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,539
fertilize a lot you know so you can

1100
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,739
figure out all the different types of

1101
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:24,960
nuances in soil as well and you know how

1102
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:27,059
those things will react with each other

1103
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,920
the other elements and like how biology

1104
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:31,380
we're working those systems as well to

1105
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,599
help keep things in a form that's going

1106
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,460
to be available for the plant really

1107
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,260
cool well let's talk about genetics a

1108
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,358
little bit what you like what's uh

1109
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,619
what's on the horizon I I guess Oklahoma

1110
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,559
is probably different than California

1111
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:47,579
right now it's like the the purple craze

1112
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,139
drives me nuts a little bit but uh

1113
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,119
yeah that's that's the scene in

1114
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,819
California and I feel like there'll

1115
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,680
always be a place which ones are which

1116
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,480
ones are real popular right now where

1117
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,598
you're at well you know it's like I mean

1118
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,639
we're still on like the RS 11 you know

1119
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,460
we got the the there's a lot of stuff

1120
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:08,159
but I think in yeah those type of things

1121
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,199
you get the zop star s11s the do farm

1122
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,879
stuff is definitely popular right now

1123
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:14,279
and I mean

1124
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,720
there's lit Farms is doing crosses with

1125
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,700
them as well with the permanent marker

1126
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:19,199
from jbz so like a lot of those

1127
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:21,480
permanent marker crosses are now

1128
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,699
starting to hit the streets but same

1129
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,079
thing with the rs11 crosses and the zope

1130
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:27,480
crosses those are definitely hitting the

1131
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,940
streets from other people

1132
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,059
um but I still feel like we're gonna go

1133
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,920
back towards gas uh you know purple

1134
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:36,539
candy gas is what they want now but I

1135
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,818
feel like the green gas will make its

1136
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:40,858
comeback the ogs the classic OG's logs

1137
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:43,019
have their place on the market South

1138
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:45,000
there's a demand for sour diesel but

1139
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:47,639
it's just not available nobody's and the

1140
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,699
thing is is it's a long flowering

1141
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:53,940
cultivar so it's a real Sour Diesel is

1142
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:58,078
it's it's a difficult one because of

1143
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:00,358
plant maintenance and flowering time and

1144
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,460
along with that additional flowering

1145
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,759
time again it's it comes with additional

1146
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,500
nutritional requirements too so it's

1147
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,780
it's just one of those

1148
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,659
you know the sour diesel that was real

1149
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:17,220
prevalent around San Diego was you know

1150
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:20,279
about 84 days yeah if you wanted to uh

1151
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:23,098
if you wanted to do it right and

1152
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:26,160
I but you know I feel like that profile

1153
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,480
like it's one like that's sour because I

1154
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,879
was smoking

1155
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,980
um I was smoking some Sour dub

1156
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,220
out in L.A when I was out there laugh

1157
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,619
and it was like oh this is this I was

1158
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:40,379
immediately as Nostalgia because it was

1159
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,000
the like the what we called the Sour OG

1160
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:47,460
down in San Diego right

1161
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,800
yeah for sure the same it was the same

1162
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,059
it was the same cultivar like it I knew

1163
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,680
it immediately because it was so

1164
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,000
nostalgic and I had grown it for such a

1165
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,519
long time it was one of my favorites for

1166
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,880
a really long time and so sours like

1167
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:03,780
that you know those I love those I love

1168
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:07,559
the PK man that was a big one but I'm

1169
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:10,980
I'm not uh I'm not super picky when it

1170
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,078
comes to like my cannabis like I love

1171
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,599
all different flavors I don't have

1172
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,859
anything that I don't specific

1173
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,079
specifically like there's some things

1174
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:21,719
that I'd like to see that I haven't seen

1175
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,640
in a long time like

1176
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:26,459
um I haven't smoked anything mentholated

1177
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:29,639
like I remember growing this variety

1178
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:32,159
called jaw rule

1179
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:35,519
I think or jaw love or something like

1180
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:37,199
that it smelled like sage like if you

1181
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,880
walk into a room where it had been burnt

1182
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,399
somebody was smoking it it smelled like

1183
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,440
white sage like distinctly smelled like

1184
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,960
white sage and I remember that was one

1185
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,099
of the characteristics of that specific

1186
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,699
variety

1187
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:53,280
and when you smoked it it was it was

1188
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:56,759
like a heavy mentholated Pine you know

1189
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,980
was it wasn't like Smoky flavored it

1190
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,780
wasn't uh didn't have like the sherb or

1191
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,940
oh you know it was it was really

1192
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,680
distinct it was a really distinct flavor

1193
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:08,280
and I haven't seen anything like that

1194
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:10,078
really long time yeah not incensey but

1195
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,240
but a lot of stuff like we get Menthol

1196
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,760
stuff occasionally but we cull most of

1197
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,618
the Menthol like any of the I don't know

1198
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,200
we go through so many different things

1199
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:21,420
and uh we find some interesting stuff

1200
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,939
and like Menthol it

1201
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,220
it depends on what level of Menthol like

1202
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,659
I can see it as negative but I know what

1203
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:29,699
you're talking about as as something

1204
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,379
that's actually tastes amazing and kind

1205
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:33,659
of adds to it especially if you get some

1206
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,818
Pine in there everything that I've been

1207
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:37,618
smoking right right now is this [ __ ]

1208
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:39,358
[ __ ] this is what everybody's wanting

1209
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,280
this is what I mean

1210
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,578
don't get me wrong it's great [ __ ]

1211
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,040
weed somebody just dropped by that grows

1212
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,900
organic soil too and they gave me but

1213
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,480
it's like that purple you know like or

1214
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:54,660
jealousy it all has that

1215
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,300
it all has that chopped cookies uh

1216
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:59,338
cookies chirps where it's like various

1217
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,700
orange a little bit you get a little

1218
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:06,559
like a Tangy in there but not heavy yeah

1219
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:06,559
it's it's that uh that like

1220
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:13,618
that artificial kind of grapey that has

1221
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,539
a little bit of like citrus in it I

1222
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:17,880
don't hate it I like smoking it but it

1223
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:19,739
seems like a lot of stuff have that in

1224
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,059
it around here at least where we're at

1225
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:21,719
and so

1226
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:24,239
um

1227
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:27,779
I'd rather just see I like you know I

1228
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:31,979
like garlics I like oh geez I like gas I

1229
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:34,920
love Jack I love Jack I uh I got an

1230
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,900
ounce uh from my boy the other day not

1231
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,119
the other day I actually smoked through

1232
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,980
it it was probably a month ago but

1233
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:46,500
My Boy Aaron he grows some just amazing

1234
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:48,119
old-school Jack dude and it's still the

1235
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,280
really old school Jack was way better

1236
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,920
yeah I mean the stuff we see is J as

1237
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,880
Jack in California is typically

1238
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,318
very well Jay I like J1 J1 and then Jay

1239
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,920
went out of bubblegum I made the J1

1240
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:04,858
bubble gum cross a long time ago but uh

1241
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,800
J1 I I think is great uh this the Jack

1242
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:10,858
Flash is great the classic Jack that was

1243
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,339
more of like musky and very complex

1244
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:15,719
compared to like the very lemony

1245
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:17,699
torpinoline limonene Jack that's very

1246
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:20,399
very linear I don't like that but I like

1247
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:23,338
the old Jacks yeah because the old Jack

1248
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,619
it's got this peppery incense along with

1249
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:28,380
this kind of really earthy earthy musk

1250
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:30,119
even though it does have that that lemon

1251
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,240
and Pine in there

1252
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,519
it's it's mixed really well with that

1253
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:38,459
type of peppery incense and that that

1254
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:40,559
that overall musk and so I don't know

1255
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,559
what it is but the stuff gets me high

1256
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,599
and this stuff the stuff doesn't doesn't

1257
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:47,578
just just doesn't do it and it's purple

1258
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,500
it's all purple weed you know it's all

1259
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,660
purple I like purple weed nothing

1260
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,880
against purple weed

1261
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:55,440
um it's just I think that's what sells

1262
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,380
man I think that's what people have

1263
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,880
always loved purple weed and it is what

1264
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,720
it is I think that you just kind of have

1265
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,420
to

1266
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,098
um grow what your market demand is you

1267
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,740
know yeah and that that's going to

1268
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,300
change over time I mean it's stuff is

1269
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,159
like popular for two months and then

1270
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,680
it's on to something new and it seems

1271
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,719
like it's it's popular but that

1272
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,500
eventually is gonna stabilize because I

1273
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:21,598
mean even with all these purple

1274
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,519
cultivars in these different profiles

1275
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,720
they're not all that different So

1276
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:26,400
eventually the market is going to

1277
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,959
stabilize a lot more people are going to

1278
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,880
go with stuff they like I mean yeah we

1279
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,338
like trying new stuff but like

1280
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,140
I I don't see it as being this way in

1281
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:36,119
five years I think it's gonna you know

1282
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,500
people are gonna have their one flavor

1283
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,599
that they're known for their five

1284
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,579
flavors that they're known for and

1285
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,500
that's that's what I've preach because I

1286
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:46,500
tell I tell people all the time like I

1287
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,300
don't advocate for like hat like I don't

1288
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,639
want deli style taken away I don't want

1289
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,680
legislation taken away I want people to

1290
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,019
be able to still have that type of

1291
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,299
experience but I tell people that the

1292
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:59,880
consumer is visually driven and so if

1293
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,920
you have a SKU and a package and things

1294
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,800
you know a label and everything else and

1295
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,659
it's consistent in the product inside

1296
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,960
it's going to build brand recognition

1297
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:11,879
and and the way that you know I've

1298
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,980
always told people when I'm talking

1299
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,539
about you know building out a brand is

1300
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,699
you know

1301
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:20,219
the the large percent of the consumer

1302
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:21,899
Market isn't a really highly educated on

1303
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:23,459
the products that they're consuming so

1304
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,019
if you can make a product that's highly

1305
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,358
relatable to them like having something

1306
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:30,960
like blueberry somebody understands

1307
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:33,900
blueberry or they understand root beer

1308
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,480
or they understand watermelon blast you

1309
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:39,480
know it doesn't like if you can if you

1310
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,219
can kind of get something that matches

1311
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,619
the description of what you're giving

1312
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:47,098
them and make it kind of General I think

1313
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:49,740
that's why so many of the the candy

1314
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:52,318
brands and stuff like that have worked

1315
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:54,000
so well is because they're relatable to

1316
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,719
the General Public

1317
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,838
and you don't necessarily need to have

1318
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:03,299
uh a lot of hype I think it just needs

1319
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:05,400
to be relatable to to people who who are

1320
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,720
interested because I've been smoking for

1321
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,818
a long ass time and I forget there's

1322
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,980
there's new consumers daily another

1323
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:12,539
thing too is I see a lot of success

1324
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,159
working with like the craft Farmers

1325
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:16,259
Alliance when we're all working together

1326
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:18,299
we're not all growing the same thing not

1327
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,040
everybody's growing permanent marker

1328
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,920
right now not everybody's growing

1329
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:25,079
rainbow sure not everybody's growing you

1330
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,880
know Mach One every you know like Red

1331
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,280
Dirt will be growing his meat and jam

1332
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,019
and his papaya and then banana seat

1333
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,619
bananicals is going to be doing her

1334
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:37,679

1335
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:39,180
cut crosses and then 4-H Farms is going

1336
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,739
to be running you know something

1337
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:44,460
different you know completely different

1338
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:46,618
and so it's kind of like keeping a

1339
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,619
community networked together that can

1340
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:51,240
help facilitate skus so like okay these

1341
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:53,400
are their skus for these for these

1342
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:56,159
people so we're not all grown the same

1343
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,680
