00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,879
bubble we named it Chemtrails and uh

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,439
yeah that when it was like day 20 of

30
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,199
flower it was already stinking up the

31
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,118
tent you know so uh it's definitely one

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
of my favorites right now it's got that

33
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,840
foul chem it does the one you just have

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,880
to keep on smelling even though it's so

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,200
bad not everybody likes it and it's like

36
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,879
one of those ones to where like if you

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,640
don't like it that's okay CU I like it

38
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,399
you know it's like one of those ones

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,599
it's something that's super nostalgic

40
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,079
for me that that I grew up on that smell

41
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,878
and i' I like it just reminds me of the

42
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,639
year 2000 yeah year 2001 chem dog when

43
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:15,399
it was first hitting the market and it's

44
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:18,000
like not OG it's got that chemy gas

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,879
where it's like a little bit foul but

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,199
really loud where like a jar of it you

47
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,239
open it up and it really burns your

48
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,238
nostrils exactly like you can't pinpoint

49
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,280
the exact flavor but I like to describe

50
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,959
like it smells like the 90s like like

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,439
the way I used to get back in the 90s

52
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,920
yeah yeah I love that and then you

53
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,800
you've grown some of my genetics you've

54
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,238
done some really cool work with the ours

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
with the Mystic Mountain blueberry which

56
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,920
I haven't got to try yet but the

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,360
pictures yeah the pictures sell it it

58
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,199
looks great yeah so I'm growing that

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,800
actually in the backyard in my little

60
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,839
shop I got a six lighter back there and

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,439
uh that particular feno just checked all

62
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,519
the boxes and uh I'll be harvesting I

63
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,878
think in about a week so when that's

64
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,920
ready to go I'll definitely send some

65
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,919
your way yeah we just had humbled seeds

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,199
on the show and so I'm glad you got that

67
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,238
you know I'm excited to show them the

68
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,199
flower cuz feel like uh the blueberry

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,599
muffin is extremely special I think that

70
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,039
if you get something that's not

71
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,119
blueberry muffin that has some of the

72
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,878
blueberry muffin in it but it's

73
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,439
different that's a great thing because

74
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,598
like blueberry muffin is its own thing

75
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,719
and it it's basically it sets some

76
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,479
really cool Trends up in Humble you know

77
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,959
especially with it well so we had DJ

78
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,439
shorts blueberry originally right and I

79
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,719
think that got wide spread there was

80
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,759
other blueberries too but then the

81
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,919
blueberry muffin is very blueberry

82
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,598
muffin oh yeah like you smell blueberry

83
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,199
muffin it smells like straight blueberry

84
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,280
muffin almost like a rotten blueberry or

85
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,359
something yeah but it's it's amazing and

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,318
it's like it's super sweet the structure

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
of it good it's got nice color it checks

88
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:43,679
a lot of the boxes MH yeah this one has

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,479
a lot of the blueberry but it also has

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
uh like a creamy I guess it's coming

91
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,518
from the double Lemon Cherry maybe over

92
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,158
gas and the bread a little bread it's

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,158
got a little bit of everything yeah yeah

94
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:55,318
it's special for sure I'll tell you what

95
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,039
though the permanent midnight those are

96
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,518
probably one of my favorites right now

97
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,318
every feno is just phenomenal in its own

98
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
way

99
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,518
yeah I brought some today I want you to

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,479
try it it's lit been my smoke that I've

101
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,640
been smoking on for a couple weeks now

102
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,238
it's yeah we've been getting a lot of uh

103
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,479
praise for the permanent midnight I

104
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,799
think it's just when you put two good

105
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,798
things together usually you get good

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
stuff but when you have so many

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,599
Expressions that are good that then it

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,680
you know stands on its own oh yeah

109
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,759
there's so many different things that

110
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,560
you can look for in it I think there's

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,439
something for everybody you know and

112
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,519
some people the the ones that don't have

113
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,000
color I feel like are pretty loud

114
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,038
yeah exactly like you want the purple

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,439
ones to be the best ones but sometimes

116
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,279
that's or usually that's not the case

117
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,759
you know it's not and it's okay you know

118
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,239
I mean I think color is like this

119
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,479
qualifier right now that I don't think

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,639
it's going to be there forever I want

121
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:45,079
the loudest the one that tastes best and

122
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,439
also the one that has the best effect

123
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,680
exactly uh color is kind of secondary

124
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,719
although right now it's very prioritized

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,600
MH so yeah I think like the flavor if it

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,080
can resonate in the smoke that's the

127
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,639
last check box for me you know that's a

128
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,319
tough one to get it's like when you

129
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,280
refire that joint and it tastes amazing

130
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,560
exact I'm all about that yeah 100% so

131
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,959
yeah especially if it's the roach like

132
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,079
if it's down to the roach and you're

133
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,239
like I don't know if it's going to taste

134
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,519
good or if it's GNA taste bad and you

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,600
fire it up you're like wow so yeah we

136
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,038
did some sour d we had a while back that

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,720
was really amazing I'm biging the sour d

138
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:18,879
so I haven't had that in a minute well

139
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,919
if you're running into the next couple

140
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,120
days I think I'll have some I'm a huge

141
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:27,639
fan of sour d and fresh batches coming

142
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,038
down nice so yeah I just I I like all

143
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,400
all different flavors I like stuff

144
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,478
that's gassy I like stuff that's

145
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,000
floral uh it just depends on what kind

146
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,839
of mood I'm in I love Skittles yeah yeah

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
so yeah but even especially the floral

148
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,079
stuff the the old school gdps stuff like

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
that stuff that nobody wants to grow

150
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,758
because it takes forever to veg exactly

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,600
it doesn't yield that much although GDP

152
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
has its place for sure oh no doubt yeah

153
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm actually growing one of those right

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,759

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,519
one yeah that and Bubba Kush I haven't

00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:36,839
back to that nostalgic feel of cannabis

165
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,519
and people know those names and I think

166
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,318
there's expectations when you buy Blue

167
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,918
Dream you should expect to get something

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,360
that's loud too but it's not what checks

169
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,639
the boxes in California maybe yeah but

170
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,560
overall you know it's not the purple

171
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,759
candy gas at all right and it's

172
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,680
something that's more

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,319
uplifting uh sativa whatever you want to

174
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,038
call it they they're longer flowering

175
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,680
varieties too yeah and there's something

176
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,478
special about longer flowering varieties

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,160
too especially effect wise where it's

178
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:04,878
like super functional you can do

179
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,199
anything on Blue Dream exactly like

180
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,599
literally you can do anything Go pass

181
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,680
your driver's test on Blue Dream because

182
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,959
you drive better yeah and that's kind of

183
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,079
how that chem 91 cross is it's just very

184
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,680
clearheaded very uh euphoric in a way

185
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,839
yeah it doesn't get me tight behind the

186
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,360
eyes M but uh it's also it can be strong

187
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,638
if you keep smoking it it definitely

188
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,280
doesn't have a ceiling like some of

189
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,400
these things it has a creeper effect

190
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,038
like you're fine and then all of a

191
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,318
sudden I have trouble talking I'm like

192
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,159
oh yeah I'm definitely there yeah I I

193
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,680
like the creeper effect sometimes but

194
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,960
other times where you're not gauging it

195
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,840
and you're just in conversation you're

196
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,279
smoking a joint you just keep hitting it

197
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,279
and then 15 minutes later you're like

198
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,959
wow exactly so yeah certain things will

199
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,159
get you there and then autoflowers have

200
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,878
come so far I'm not sure if you've

201
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,479
tapped into the Autoflower Market at all

202
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,000
but I haven't really you know I mean our

203
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,158
facility is a little like yours where

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,560
it's a research and development SL

205
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,199
production in a way so I haven't really

206
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't have a room dedicated to Auto

207
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,000
flowers um I've done a little bit in the

208
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,038
past but I really haven't messed with

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,079
them too much

210
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:03,800
yeah are they getting more stable as

211
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,959
they are getting I mean there so there's

212
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,639
a handful of people that produce amazing

213
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,158
autoflowers and then there's everybody

214
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,360
else and I think it's like that with

215
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,800
most things yeah but yeah with autof

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,919
flowers there are people that produce

217
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,360
stable autof flowers that Express pretty

218
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,038
even across the board and there's other

219
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,520
people every single plant grows a

220
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,399
different uh size that different shape

221
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,279
you're getting a lot of phenotypical

222
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,560
variation right and then there's the

223
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,279
guys that are growing stuff that's

224
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,599
pretty straight across the board that

225
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,120
they're all very similar or almost

226
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,839
identical Goa and

227
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,918
so over time you're going to get better

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,440
and better better Expressions more even

229
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,919
Expressions especially but a lot of

230
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,000
people are focusing on aut flowers now

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,639
too so I'm excited for autof flowers I

232
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,720
love autof flowers outdoor there's a

233
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,639
handful of guys that are crushing it

234
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
indoors uh Rue that you I think we met

235
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,360
on phone calls before yeah yeah he's

236
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,720
crushing Autos he does he does a lot of

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,680
our testing for autos and nice yeah he's

238
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,600
doing a deep water culture you know he's

239
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,479
doing some cool stuff yeah yeah he's a

240
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,320
good dude man yeah he's a character

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,320
loves weed yeah absolutely definitely

242
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,680
yeah I guess with me the autof flowers I

243
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,399
had a trouble I didn't even know you had

244
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,078
the flower I'm under 18 hours of light

245
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,440
for a minute and so that was one of my

246
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:20,559
issues and then I finally figured that

247
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,880
out but yeah I guess I just struggle

248
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,000
with the stability of it in production

249
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,120
yeah I think it's one of those things

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
like for you your your Market is a

251
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,039
little bit different too going with

252
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,360
Autos is kind of a tougher Market mhm

253
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,199
but uh it's one of those things I feel

254
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,800
like we've overlooked them for so long

255
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,600
and now they're starting to get good and

256
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,078
they're they're not for everybody yeah

257
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,399
but they definitely have their place

258
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,319
exactly so they get a lot of hate you

259
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,600
know but people don't don't always

260
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,399
understand things and you know there's a

261
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,440
lot of hate on all kinds of stuff oh

262
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,480
yeah no doubt so yeah and you're doing

263
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,440
breeding now too uh yeah so I just

264
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,320
started dabbling about six years ago

265
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,560
Crossing and then um reading your book

266
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,680
has helped me quite a bit you know as

267
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,399
far as reversing them now and then I've

268
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,199
been selfing some of my better venos

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,759
making seed with those um and then

270
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,560
mostly like I focus on type two flowers

271
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,559
which is like CBD and THC and so I've

272
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,399
been finding like my best like chem 91 I

273
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,599
just crossed with some of my best CBD

274
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,519
plants yeah to make some type two seeds

275
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,560
so that's that's my big focus is type

276
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
twos I really it's a good medical

277
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,559
product it is it really is and for me

278
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,480
I'm a little older and sometimes the

279
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,679
type ones are too much for me those type

280
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,360
twos just hit perfectly especially

281
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,239
during the day you know when I'm trying

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,120
to get stuff done totally and CBD is

283
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,519
just good for you in general feel like

284
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,639
oh yeah I eat CBD I I don't smoke as

285
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,799
much CBD as I'd like but I definitely

286
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,639
have been eating a lot of CBD at night

287
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,719
no it definitely helps me with sleep

288
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,600
I'll eat two gummies before I go to bed

289
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,360
inflammation yeah for me it's

290
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,600
inflammation exactly uh yeah I take like

291
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,759
an antihistamine sometimes I take badil

292
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,959
but I don't want to get addicted to

293
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,639
benad dril because I think benad dril

294
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,039
can be very addictive uhhuh especially

295
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,519
for sleep yeah I don't like Ben because

296
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:07,559
the next day I'm like a zombie you know

297
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,240
as good sleep I'm okay with Bene yeah

298
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,359
but CBD there's never any like you don't

299
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,680
have any side effects from it it's ex

300
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,159
it's always like you feel great yeah so

can't do that in the States you totally

319

can't get away with that in metric

320
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,480
especially you know

321
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,919
cnia there's no cartoon anything like

322
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,120
that typically they're starting to do

323
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,639
that with the hemp side as well like all

324

325
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,399
the same stuff no cartoons you know all

326
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,399
that so yeah no animals no animals no

327
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,278
unicorns yeah yeah I mean it's it's

328
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,958
still you know they're behind us in some

329
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,078
ways in Europe and it's interesting

330
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,198
because I feel like they're not jaded by

331
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,838
the the wreck that we've you know the

332
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:31,359
wreck Market uh all the stuff that's

333
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,920
gone on with the farm bill there's still

334
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,519
it's still like uh 10 years 10 years ago

335
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,439
and there's people they're still super

336
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,399
excited about more excited than they are

337
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,760
in the states yeah so and I just went to

338
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,039
the Caribbean and they're even more

339
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,159
excited down there like their you know

340
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,919
their flower isn't as good as what we

341
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,480
typically see in the US but they love

342
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,919
wheat they love cannabis they love

343
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,759
cannabis on a medical level on a

344
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,240
spiritual level all these things and but

345
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,399
they're excited about it like that's

346
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,600
awesome the smiles on their faces and

347
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,639
how excited they are in St Vincent and

348
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,040
the gred is pretty amazing hell yeah

349
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,320
that's good stuff and I have noticed

350
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,639
that like in Europe when I go over there

351
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,800
I feel like yeah like you said like 10

352
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,560
years behind in a way is far as maybe

353
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:13,479
genetics but and their laws like the

354
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,559
laws uh we've been shipping flour over

355
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,120
now to UK and Switzerland different

356
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,399
countries they're all different you know

357
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,799
like Switzerland I think is 1% D I heard

358
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,039
Germany just switched to 1% too oh

359
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,120
really I didn't know that Czech

360
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,439
Republic's uh 1% but then you have UK

361
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,600
that's like 0.2 which you can't get

362
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,360
anything but like a CBG plant in there

363
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,920
right um very gray area I kind of

364
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,560
compare that to the hemp industry back

365
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,240
in maybe 2018 yeah so it's kind of you

366
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,919
look at it almost like a fortune teller

367
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
like I see where that's going I feel

368
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,240
like hopefully it'll take off you know

369
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,839
you'll dial it in I think everybody's

370
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,039
kind of dialing their stuff in the fact

371
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,560
that Germany went recreational huge huge

372
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,240
yeah it's just such a big step for

373
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,559
everybody you know it's like it's its

374
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,919
impact is so big on countries like the

375
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,319
United States that are holding out it's

376
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:03,278
like well Germany's doing it exactly I

377
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,240
think we really need to re-evaluate what

378
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,198
we're doing over here on a federal level

379
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
U

380
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,000
especially going I mean the funny thing

381
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,759
is is like you can't even go state to

382
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,159
state if they're medical you know or

383
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,120
state to state if they're recreational

384
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,639
so interstate commerce is off the table

385
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,679
right now and it needs to be a big

386
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,039
conversation because we have so many

387
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,719
medical and so many recreational states

388
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,919
that could be working with other states

389
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,278
and there's you know there's a lot of

390
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,198
money there for these states and you

391
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,360
know I think it would add a lot of value

392
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,198
to the states that aren't able to

393
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,839
produce as much exactly um and

394
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:36,120
especially places like California and

395
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,560
Oregon where they produce so much more

396
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,879
than they can consume exactly and I

397
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,599
think that might be where the hemp

398
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,039
industry kind of came in and you know

399
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,959
now they're shipping it out as thca

400
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,078
right and then but yeah that does suck

401
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,078
that that that yall you can't do

402
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,679
interstate commerce you know well I'm

403
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,638
just happy I'm focused on genetics and

404
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,719
not flowers exactly like I I keep that

405
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,198
focused it's like it's rough being a

406
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,360
cultivator in a licensed St right now e

407
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,919
even you know some of these new ones

408
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,360
that are coming online I mean that some

409
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,479
of them they have only a handful of

410
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,039
licenses and that makes it more

411
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,879
competitive um to a degree but I think

412
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,319
that if we're looking at States you know

413
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,399
and the future of where it goes it has

414
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,000
to go interstate commerce yeah um and

415
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,958
you know I like the fact that hemp is

416
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,720
legal everywhere I mean look at Texas

417
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,879
it's their big loophole for having legal

418
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,079
flow exactly and a lot of the east coast

419
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,519
states are that way you know Tennessee

420
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,638
is one uh

421
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,078
yeah Kentucky just now went medical we

422
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,318
were looking at getting a license up

423
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:37,559
there yeah but the regulations weren't

424
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:39,039
solid so we kind of backed off that one

425
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,278
but like States like Virginia North

426
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,919
Carolina are just you can still grow as

427
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,399
long as it's under3 Delta 9 right which

428
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,039
we all know doesn't really growing the

429
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,318
plant so you can get away with a lot

430
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,039
more a lot lot more in the hemp industry

431
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,719
yeah there's a lot less oversight for

432
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,759
sure yeah and just working with people

433
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,920
in other states and everything else you

434
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,919
by the books you're safe I know yeah

435
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,838
which is really it's really unique you

436
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,120
know being from

437
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,959
Tennessee I always wanted to do this for

438
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,639
a living you know and I knew one day I

439
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,758
would I KN never thought it'd be in this

440
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,120
fashion you know where we would still be

441
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,159
illegal in Tennessee and I had to move

442
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,159
and pivot over to the hemp industry so I

443
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,879
could grow because I've always been an

444
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,039
indoor grower right um and then once I

445
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,838
figured out I could grow you know CBD

446
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:25,958
plants the genetics were far enough

447
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,639
along so you like that Tennessee whiskey

448
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:32,159
too oh yeah yeah that's super close to

449
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,399
us actually Kentucky bourbon's probably

450
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,838
uh a little little better for me yeah

451
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,519
yeah I like Japanese whiskey yeah I mean

452
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,399
I like it all I don't drink that much

453
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,799
alcohol but I do like good whiskey I

454
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,360
mostly drink mcow and I drink tequila

455
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,318
yep that's me too I switched to Tequila

456
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
right five years ago getting older you

457
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:52,919
know that's what happens when I was

458
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,680
young I drink Everything Wine Coolers

459
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,759
yeah occasionally occasionally yeah

460
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,958
craft beers and now it's like all of

461
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,759
that gives me headaches yeah I don't

462
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,758
drink any beer and I love beer I

463
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,720
absolutely love the way it taste uh yeah

464
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,798
I mean I was drinking sier Nevada and

465
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,160
Lanas when I was like uh 18 years old so

466
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,480
I love that stuff I used to love Lanas

467
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,360
yeah me too yeah I worked for the

468
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,838
company I worked for Logan yeah I did

469
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,599
all kinds of stuff with Logan I was a

470
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,078
chef and did their Beer Circus okay and

471
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,558
so we traveled all around the United

472
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,519
States that was when they were starting

473
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,359
to become a bigger company is that when

474
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,960
they moved to Chicago and opened up a

475
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,279
spot there moved to Chicago they did

476
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,400
some beer circuses out there okay we did

477
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,240
them in New York Los Angeles Seattle all

478
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,120
over that had to be a good gig it was

479
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,160
amazing uh you know flying around with

480
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,558
these guys and these performers and it

481
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,640
was like I did the backstage food nice

482
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,038
and it was it was amazing it was just

483
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,759
you know it was like disco though once

484
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,400
it was gone it was gone yeah so yeah it

485
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,319
was fun while it lasted it was and in

486
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,440
the beginning it was I volunteered for

487
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:58,399
it uh I did it for 10 years okay and in

488
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,038
the beginning it was a volunteer gig and

489
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,440
I got my Chef friends together and we

490
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,038
basically went up there and put out food

491
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,679
for the volunteers and put out food for

492
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:08,200
the performers and it was a blast and it

493
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,640
was like it turned into something where

494
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,960
they were like okay we got to take care

495
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,960
of you now that we're with Heineken it

496
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,519
was especially around when hinin merged

497
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,919
with yeah and H hinin acquired them uh

498
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,359
they decided that they couldn't just

499
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,720
allow me to do it for free I got and so

500
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,839
they had to cover my expenses and all

501
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,519
these other things and it was just a

502
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:32,199
blast and it was like the company was

503
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:33,879
just accelerating so fast and then just

504
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,279
the energy was so good at these events

505
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,480
it's like a lot of cannabis people too

506

535
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,440
visualizing beer way back then way ahead

536
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,720
of their time that is so cool and now

537

541
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,158
exactly when it comes to beer it's like

542
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,839
there's also everybody's got their own

543
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,480
you know micro brew or craft beer you

544
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,279
ever get into like sour beers or

545
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,599
anything I do I like sour be I like

546
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,519
Belgian I like all kinds of stuff like

547

yeah yeah yeah I mean I I like it all so

549
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,960
it's funny in the Caribbean we drink

550
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,600
warm Guinness oh really and uh yeah they

551
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,519
they make a special extra bitter

552
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,359
Guinness for the Caribbean okay and you

553
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,079
drink it warm and it's it's just the

554
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,319
thing to do and it's like uh I've been

555
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,759
out to the Caribbean I don't know a

556
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:25,079
dozen times or something like that and

557
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,759
it's just part of the adventure you know

558
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:28,119
it's like that's what everybody does I I

559
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,000
drink warm beer when I'm out in the

560
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,000
Caribbean no problem is it good it's not

561
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,839
bad it gets you buzzed pretty quick but

562
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,919
it's also not actually I think it's like

563
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,240
7% out there because regular Guinness I

564
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,200
think is yeah lower yeah so and then I

565
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,319
like dude like traditional beer in

566
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,640

especially Spain is Rosen

588
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,038

rosin too M uh smoke mostly flow smoke

591
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,440
mostly joints but also rosin yeah love

592
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,720
rosin now hash holes I for a while I was

593
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,798
like n I'm not smoking those hash holes

594
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,960
and now it's like I had a surplus of

595
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,558
rosin people have been giving me rosin

596
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,159
so I've been mixing it with joints and I

597
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,200
love it I love Skittles with different

598
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,799
kinds of rosin I've never tried a hash

599
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
hole I've always wanted to try one of

600
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,759
those I bet they're phenomenal well the

601
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,599
day is Young so so yeah we can totally

602
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,558
get into hash holes it's like that's one

603
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,879
of those things you can go down the

604
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,359
rabbit hole with because it's like

605
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,440
pairing flavors it's a lot of fun and

606
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,000
it's like that's a good call I like

607
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,798
Skittles because I feel like it's a base

608
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,079
candy flavor and then you can take that

609
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,839
and you could put almost anything with

610
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,639
it you can go gas with it you can go

611
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,278
more candy you can go any direction you

612
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,799
can go some of these papayas taste

613
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:24,558
amazing with it uh the super boof Cherry

614
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,038
which is one of my favorite

615
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:30,720
extracts uh that stuff tastes great and

616
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:33,000
it's like a little bit of Tangi rind but

617
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,519
also cherry and all these other flavors

618

00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,599
Dabo very small amount yeah think I got

621
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,919
like a half gram but those make some

622
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,959
great hash holes too it's good Stu what

623
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,159
is that dabad do I saw a couple things

624
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,640
about it on Instagram so the dabad do is

625
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,760
this great event for Mila Jansen um

626
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,000
she's the hash Queen okay yeah and she

627
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,720
started it and I was part of the one in

628
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,880
San Francisco and basically what it is

629
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,480
is a competition hash competition we had

630
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,960
three categories we had a rosin we had a

631
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,200
we had a a bubble like ice water and

632
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,519
then we had a traditional SL Temple ball

633
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,159
category okay and so people enter and

634
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,558
then before we used to give little small

635
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,640
samples to everybody and Sam jur from

636
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,119
Focus V and rosent Tech and he helped

637
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
put it on with me and we decided to

638
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,119
instead of doing it the way where we

639
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
everyone got like a 0.1 we were going to

640
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,079
have jars where people could get a

641
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,240
sample out of the jar that would be

642
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,000
better they could they could grade the

643
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,240
visual appeal they could smell it they

644
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,558
could get so many more things out of

645
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,120
seeing a big jar of it so we had five

646
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,558
gram jars that basically got passed

647
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,319

725
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,320
having people like that in the industry

726
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,720
that care so much and that are not all

727
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:39,079
about the money they see the value in

728
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,399
the quality right quality of nutrients

729
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,639
quality of what they're doing and it

730
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:45,199
stems over to everything else the

731
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,960
quality of their friends uh the quality

732
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,798
of the food they like the events they go

733
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,679
to it's just uh those are the kind of

734
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:54,079
people we need more of in the industry I

735
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,120
couldn't agree more definitely yeah and

736
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,759
they make some good nutrients they do

737
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,798
they do I yeah it's they're they're

738
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,640
great people when they make good

739
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,079
nutrients um we're fortunate that

740
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,640
there's a ton of people in this industry

741
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,319
that care slowly but surely they've gone

742
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,960
away but that's a whole another

743
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,119
conversation but yeah know I there's

744
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,480
there's a lot of big business and

745
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:17,439
there's a lot of people that still care

746
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,440
and it's been tough as a cultivator it's

747
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,080
tough right now it's tough to compete so

748
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,159
you really have to focus on quality of

749
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:24,480
your product right I think that's the

750
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,039
most important thing I know you do

751
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,960
because I smoke your product so it's

752
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,398
like I mean we have to in the CBD world

753
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,159
you know it's like it doesn't get you

754
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,599
high so it's got to taste good it's got

755
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,919
to smoke good so we focus on quality

756
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:39,359
above everything yeah I think the the

757
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,038
visual appeal of your product is great

758
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,839
and some of the packaging like you did

759
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,158
some packaging with you did the Mac one

760
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,119
with cap yeah and you got the little

761
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,039
hats on the the jars and I'm like this

762
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,319
is this is I brought you one totally

763
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,839
yeah that's that's awesome I love that I

764
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,519
love that side of the industry where you

765
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,759
can be creative and it still is

766
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,480
functional um and you know I'm sure cap

767
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,919
loves it he's I still got to get him on

768
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,720
my show yeah he's incredible man that

769
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,159
guy is a character he's like once we

770
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,640
started selling them you know across the

771
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,278
country he's like man this is historic

772
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
for me you know because I mean and it

773
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:13,759
makes sense being in the hemp industry

774
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,559
we can sell all over and for him his

775
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,240
brand is California based and to have it

776
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,278
Go all over the country I'm sure that

777
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,880
was a really good uh good surprise for

778
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,839
him for sure he's another one that cares

779
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,760
oh yeah he's super passionate and

780
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,879
anybody who says the cap doesn't care

781
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:34,038
they don't know cap because at 20 in

782
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,919
2017 at Emerald cup he wore his little

783
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:39,679
disguise mhm and he had the longest line

784
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:42,080
there was probably a 400 foot long line

785
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,120
to meet him and he spent time with every

786
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:47,158
single person yeah and I don't know

787
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:49,479
anybody else who does that on that level

788
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,559
that is out there and wants to spend

789
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,558
time with the people that want to talk

790
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,558
to him exactly a lot of people when when

791
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,960
you get you get to a certain level they

792
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,359
they act like they're better than other

793
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,759
people and I'm not naming any names or

794
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,759
specifically talking about any one

795
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,720
person but a lot of people they start

796
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,158
getting this celebrity status or

797
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,240
whatever and they start feeling like

798
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,519
they're a celebrity and really we're

799
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,839
just all the same yeah right we're just

800
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,480
all people trying to do our job and yeah

801
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,798
none of us are special I I think if we

802
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,399
can get over that whole thing that we're

803
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:20,038
not special we're just here to do what

804
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:21,398
we're here to do and if you can get over

805
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,679
that thing then you can really do

806
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,759
amazing things in this world I know and

807
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,120
it just cracks me up that he still hides

808
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,599
his character like there's not many

809
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,319
people in this world

810
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,038
you can't find the face for the name you

811
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,759
know what I mean and it's just he's like

812
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,158
wiie Wonka in a way oh yeah it's part of

813
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,119
his image right and it's great you know

814
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,840
and he's got his Mac one and he's you

815
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,678
know I think we wrote a case study in

816
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,519
the book for with the Mac one and I

817
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:47,559
thought that was extremely valuable as a

818
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,359
partial triploid uh natural partial

819
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:51,440
triploid yeah you can't really breed

820
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,158
with it very well no it's a it's an

821
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,440
interesting cul ofar and it it is a

822
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,080
beautiful plant yeah you know all it

823
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,919
really is like I've grown many of plants

824
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,720
and that one's like one and a million

825
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,440
it's just so different and just so and

826
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,960
you're right like I have a pretty good

827
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,519
story about the Mac one I tried

828
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,600
reversing it uh probably like six eight

829
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,440
months ago before I knew that it wasn't

830
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:14,240
really good as far as good luck yeah so

831
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,480
I took 22 of my best strains in the

832
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,319
building my favorite ones pollinated it

833
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,360
after pollinated all of them and then

834
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,759
after they were done I found 10 seeds

835
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,639
out of those 10 seeds one sprouted and

836
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,079
I'm growing that one in at my house

837
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,278
right now and hoping crossing my fingers

838
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,720
like it's it's a good one and it's

839
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,240
turning out to be decent but you know

840
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,399
it's just so hard I didn't realize how

841
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,880
hard it was to and probably

842
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,278
self-pollinated it's not even it's like

843
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,399
exactly that would be the funniest thing

844
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,960
ever is you go there's no Mac in it I

845
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:45,239
know and that happens you know and it's

846
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,720
just one of those things but it's a good

847
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,480
learning experience all these things are

848
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,319
good learning experiences exactly what

849
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,159
do you do for your reversals for your

850
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:58,960
reversal spray so we use uh is it sodium

851
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:02,120
thy sod th sufate with silver nitrate

852
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,639
nit yeah yeah sorry and uh yeah we spray

853
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:08,959
them I do it three times a day um until

854
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:11,439
they're basically start producing male

855
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,278
flowers three times a day and you use a

856
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,759
very mild concentration one let's see

857
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,200
what was it like 100 milliliters to

858
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,759
about 500 milliliters something like

859
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,840
that yeah so one to five maybe

860
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:27,240
interesting yeah I believe so can't yeah

861
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,119
everybody has their own recipes there's

862
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,159
a good recipe in my my book from Khalifa

863
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,158
genetics I didn't include a STS recipe

864
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,159
that was my own for liability purposes I

865
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,360
use a nano silver myself okay that

866
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,679
really works well for me and my friend

867
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,839
Tim humiston makes it it's awesome

868
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,278
stuff uh but everyone has their own way

869
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,599
and there's several ways to block

870
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:50,319
ethylene in the plant so you can get a

871
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,759
good reversal yeah uh so yeah it's just

872
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,278
it's all about trying different things

873
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,798
and figuring out the one that works for

874
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,480
you there's some that are like one and

875
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,759
done you spray it right when you flip

876
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,839
boom you have some you have some male

877
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,240
flowers right and you have poll sacks

878
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,959
you know so and I've experimented with

879
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,638
some different stuff and I keep going

880
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,600
back to the same thing I just I like the

881
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:09,678
way it reverses the plant I feel like

882
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,240
it's super healthy and I get these crazy

883
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,399
reversals where they do dump a lot

884
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,679
different than regular pollen you know

885
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,119
regular pollen you can poll one little

886
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,038
plant will pollinate a whole room you

887
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:24,199
can make 100,000 seeds yeah more than

888
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,720
100,000 seeds with one male it's crazy

889
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,159
and one female you you probably it's

890
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,038
five to one but it just depends on the

891
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,120
cultivar some reverse really easily some

892
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:34,119
reverse a lot you they're harder to

893
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:36,239
reverse yeah I'm finding that out as

894
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,000
well yeah no plants the same when it

895
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,440
comes to that no and you have to almost

896
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,880
have a specific sop for each cultivar uh

897
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,480
some of them I found that you have to

898
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,639
start spraying a lot earlier on and

899
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,000
other ones you could probably start

900
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:50,839
spraying the day before flower and

901
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,679
you're going to get a reversal just fine

902
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:56,119
so you're just spraying one time no no

903
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,399
no I start two weeks before okay on

904
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:59,439
certain cultivars if they're really hard

905
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:01,839
I start two two weeks before M if I know

906
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,399
the plant and I know that I can do it in

907
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,798
one week because a lot of them all do

908
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,719
that and you can start a week before and

909
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,200
then you go until you see flowers but a

910
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,558
lot of time you start two weeks before

911
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,519
with the nano silver I get the results

912
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,158
I'm looking for I gotta and then if

913
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,038
you're introducing them into other

914
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:21,320
plants you basically flip your your uh

915
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,519
donors two weeks before your receivers

916
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,720
that's what we're doing yeah yeah and

917
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,960
it's not always I've had them where you

918
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,798
flip them the same time and they come

919
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,319
out perfect certain cultivars basically

920
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,398
they'll produce male flowers a lot

921
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,839
quicker and then they dump quicker but I

922
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:35,359
like short pollen windows so I try to

923
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:38,599
keep them separate mhm introduce

924
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,638
intermingle the plants and do that with

925
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,599
as short of a a window as possible so

926
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:44,599
the seeds are as even as possible so

927
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,558
when you introduce them to a female say

928
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:50,839
you're dealing with a early finisher

929
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,798
like 50 56 days is there a certain day I

930
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:54,798
guess you could say or days like what

931
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:58,679
okay so like a 70-day plant would you

932
00:33:54,798 --> 00:34:00,558
still introduce it around a 21 or day 21

933
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,120
to 28 it just depends

934
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,960
on uh like the bud size may it depends

935
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,439
on the bud size it depends on how

936
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,918
developed it is certain things you may

937
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,159
have to wait a little bit longer you

938
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,319
know longer flowering but then some of

939
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,679
the longer flowering ones finish faster

940
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,919
when you pollinate them okay right and

941
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,720
so but you have to wait until you have a

942
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,719
substantial amount of bra and you have

943
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:27,039
the pistols that'll pull that pollen

944
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:29,439
okay uh so it's all very unique to each

945
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,239
individual cultivar yeah you can you can

946
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,878
generalize and say okay you know the

947
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:36,519
three and a half weeks on day 25 that's

948
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,199
when you introduce your pollen um you

949
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,519
know and I also love having redundancies

950
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,439
the other thing is having a jar of

951
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,079
pollen along with those reversals

952
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,079
because those reversals don't always go

953
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,599
as planned yeah so having backup pollen

954
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,760
is one of the most important things with

955
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,720
breeding as a

956
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,280
redundancy and a lot of people you know

957
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,279
you learn that from [ __ ] up that's

958
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,440
how I learned it I learned it from

959
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,720
[ __ ] up because i' I tried to reverse

960
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,800
some stuff that didn't reverse well and

961
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,399
I didn't get good reversal but I think

962
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,839
redundancies are one of the most

963
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,480
important things when you're doing stuff

964
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,279
like breeding I gotta So speaking of

965
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,039
this totally off topic but speaking of

966
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:13,320
like early finishing I read somewhere

967
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:16,480
about flowering 11 hours on and 13 hours

968
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,920
off and them finishing earlier have you

969
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,920
ever heard anything like that is that is

970
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,320
that just some R science no that I mean

971
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,519
there there might be some truth to that

972
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,640
I don't know like equatorial varieties

973
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:29,358
apparently if you flower them 11 on and

974
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,719
13 off definitely get them to trigger

975
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,319
faster I know for a fact you yeah that

976
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,519
makes sense so like with triggering them

977
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,079
faster there's all kinds of stuff you

978
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,440
can do but definitely like the longer

979
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,800
flowering they don't want sometimes they

980
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,760
don't want to flip like so these 16 week

981
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,680
varieties if you're doing them indoors

982
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,320
you might have to do a few things so

983
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:48,519
sometimes it's lowering the light down

984
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,000
to eight or 10 hours and then they're

985
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:52,400
only getting eight or 10 hours of light

986
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,079
and the rest is darkness and then also

987
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,200
basically changing your temperatures so

988
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,480
your daytime temp there's a bigger swing

989
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,919
between daytime and nighttime temp okay

990
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,199
that helps and if nothing else you can

991
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,880
go hit them with some PK I got you yeah

992
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,078
that'll get them going yeah avoid the

993
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,838
nitrog hit them with some PK some some

994
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,160
and you can foler them uh that works

995
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,199
really well um and those are like the

996
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:15,480
three things I would say if you're

997
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:18,078
trying to get them to flip faster if

998
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,719
you're making seeds okay all right good

999
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,400
tips yeah I mean those are just trial

1000
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:25,000
and error you know I've had friends give

1001
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,280
me advice and tried it and it seems to

1002
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,639
work pretty

1003
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,200
good so and I like longer flowering

1004
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,960
varieties you know my my buddy Dave from

1005
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,639
budalo he's kind of got me back on the

1006
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,159
path of longer flowering is good and I'm

1007
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,960
like you're right longer fling is good

1008
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,118
it's also stronger a lot of times but

1009
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,720
stronger can be good too yeah exactly

1010
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,160
you know and it's not always stronger

1011
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,480
sometimes it's like uh these ones they

1012
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:49,519
they lift you up and then they you just

1013
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,159
stay there you know but you feel good

1014
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,039
it's not like stronger like heart

1015
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,960
palpitations yeah I'm not really big

1016
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,960
into the anxiety weed I can't stand it

1017
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,079
like I got friends that tell me I'm like

1018
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,000
I can't stand that one they're like

1019
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:03,560
that's the one I want some people love

1020
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,280
that the heart Racers I'm like I got

1021
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:08,440
heart issues as it is I don't mean to be

1022
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,200
you know faking myself out yeah so yeah

1023
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,559
I feel you and I do like I like some of

1024
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,719
the upside you know sativas I do like

1025
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,078
you know I do like a good sativa I like

1026
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,480
the strawberry cough I love the

1027
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,079
Strawberry Cough a great one yeah as far

1028
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,400
as like effect it's like a stronger Blue

1029
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,599
Dream we've talked about Kyle kushman on

1030
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,400
the show it's a good one it's like a

1031
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,400
stronger blue dream has that uplifting

1032
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,838
effect where you feel really good yeah

1033
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,039
it's like borderline panic attack for me

1034
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:36,440
it is but it's not it's like right under

1035
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,400
yeah yeah whereas some of the super

1036
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,079
silver haze if you dab some super silver

1037
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,000
haze that can get you your imagine yeah

1038
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,760
I think Tangi might have been the

1039
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,880
strongest C I don't even know if it's C

1040
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,480
but as far as panic attacks go really I

1041
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,119
tried that back in um it was probably

1042
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,599
2016 in

1043
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,559
Denver interesting because I've never

1044
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,280
got I I felt like 10 wasn't always as

1045
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,960
strong for me really yeah but that's

1046
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,800
depending on when you harvest it too

1047
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,318
that could be like okay they took it

1048
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,640
freaking two weeks past where You'

1049
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:09,639
normally harvested that'll give you

1050
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,639
panic attacks yeah that'll totally give

1051
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:14,000
you panic attacks yeah

1052
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:16,400
autoflow autoflow will do that too if

1053
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,920
you go like 90 days on autoflow to try

1054
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,680
to get it to yield more or you feel like

1055
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,800
it's going to produce more and you just

1056
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:24,838
watch it and you should have harvested

1057
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,800
on day 65 it's going to be way stronger

1058
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,679
typically think it's it converts Maybe

1059
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,318
it does and sometimes they go up and

1060
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,480
you're getting more Delta 9 probably but

1061
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:37,719
also you know it changes the whole

1062
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,039
cannaboid profile yeah tarpine profile

1063
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,598
and and with the Entourage effect you it

1064
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,039
can be you know especially going like a

1065
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,440
week longer sometimes it can go up and

1066
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,159
then drop right but a lot of times I

1067
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,079
feel like that's where you can get Delta

1068
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,879
9 in too especially in the flower is if

1069
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,359
you go longer with exactly you if you

1070
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,920
harvest it earlier it's going to be hemp

1071
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,358
but all these hemp varieties almost all

1072
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,000
of them if you you go longer with them

1073
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:03,199
they're going to turn into Delta 'll

1074
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,519
start all of them yeah right they'll all

1075
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,118
get like they all go past that 3%

1076
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,838
threshold there's nothing that won't go

1077
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,519
past it and that's why it's so hard for

1078
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,719
the government to make rules and

1079
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,199
regulations around it because it's like

1080
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,879
dude like if you harvest it you have

1081
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:17,759
this Harvest window and you test it a

1082
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,800
month

1083
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,640
before it's hard to say what could

1084
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,680
happen you know it's like and it's just

1085
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,159
so hard to actually put it into numbers

1086
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:28,199
on a piece of paper where it's like okay

1087
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,598
these are the rules for this Reon

1088
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:33,000
because every situation doesn't fit

1089
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,680
exactly and every plant's different you

1090
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,358
every plant's so different like I've

1091
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,639
done thousands of tests coas looked at

1092
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,159
them I mean that's what we have to do in

1093
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:43,559
our industry and certain plants you can

1094
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,759
take all the way to term like Mac one

1095
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,719
for example yeah and then just do an

1096
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,520
early test when it's not all the way

1097
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,639
cured out and you'll get a compliant

1098
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,440
test yeah whereas um Dante's Inferno I

1099
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,838
believe is another one you could even

1100
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,800
take that a little early but it's going

1101
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,199
to fail every time just because the

1102
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,160
Delta 9 spikes Donny Burger yeah we

1103
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,318
don't have Donnie Burger on here because

1104
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,639
it's like one of those ones is just test

1105
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,639
dirty it'll test past that three

1106
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,559
threshold from the beginning exactly

1107
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,559
yeah it's like so and there's nothing I

1108
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,039
love Donny Burger extract shout out to

1109
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,639
Floren flame for growing some of the

1110
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,400
best Donnie burger and making the best

1111
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:20,159
rosin with it phenomenal stuff but that

1112
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,559
stuff tests hot from the beginning we

1113
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,920
don't have it you know it's like I do

1114
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,838
hemp research and development we keep it

1115
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,440
on the building yeah yeah so yeah it's

1116
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:30,199
just easier so I got a question on like

1117
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,800
drying and curing U what's your sweet

1118
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:36,439
spot like when you're drying and get

1119
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:38,160
like when what day so 660 is a rule of

1120
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,480
thumb but like sometimes you can go that

1121
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,279
60 to

1122
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,760
65 uh you know as far as for humidity

1123
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,800
yeah right like when you smoke like when

1124
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,560
you pulling it down like I'm an early

1125
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,119
like I like smoking when it's you know

1126
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,960
mid teens like of hanging like I don't

1127
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,680
like waiting too much farther now we we

1128
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,240
usually go 10 days and then we trim it

1129
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,000
down like that's what I leave uh you

1130
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,639
know and it's just depending on the

1131
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,119
situation but like around 10 days it

1132
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,118
start you know but I feel like 14 day

1133
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,079
it's we do a 14-day dry that's what we

1134
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,160
do yeah I think 14 days is the normal

1135
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,119
dry period but sometimes we'll trim it

1136
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,519
at day 10 depending on how big the buds

1137
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,160
are and all the other things you know

1138
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,719
you're looking for that crack with the

1139
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:20,960
stem yeah uh that snap you want that

1140
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:23,279
little I guess what I'm saying is I just

1141
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,199
like the buzz better when it's early you

1142
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,480
know I think the Tarpin and everything

1143
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,078
Oh you mean when you harvest early yeah

1144
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,519
so not necessarily harvesting or but

1145
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:34,000
smoking the flour before it's cured out

1146
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:36,280
some people say one month cure two month

1147
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,559
cure yeah I mean I've been a lot I've

1148
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,920
been so the funniest part that's great

1149
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,719
that you brought this up because I've

1150
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,000
been going back and forth I do feel like

1151
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,199
especially with the Skittles that we've

1152
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,079
been getting that my friends are going

1153
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,879
so we have cultivation partners and

1154
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,560
these guys over SF can are crushing it

1155
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,318
on a whole another level they did some

1156
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,078
dirt Skittles recently and grown in soil

1157
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,719
dirt Skittles dirt Skittles I call it

1158
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,160
dirt Skittles but it's just so oil grown

1159
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:01,919
Skittles right I got you but side by

1160
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,719
side with the Coco growing in the same

1161
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,200
environment with the same nutrition same

1162
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,439
lighting everything else same flush and

1163
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:12,358
the dirt Skittles was [ __ ] amazing

1164
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,358
and the thing is is they harvest on day

1165
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:18,159
53 but it's a fresh product and if you

1166
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,558
harvest it right correctly you dry it

1167
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,000
cure it right when it's done after the

1168
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,599
two weeks that's when it was the best

1169
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,760
right yeah week three it was still good

1170
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,200
week four it was still good week five it

1171
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,520
was starting to be not as good but like

1172
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:34,399
literally it's phenomenal like that and

1173
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,440
that stuff it's the first time I smoke

1174
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,358
Skittles where I'm like damn the

1175
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,760
Skittles is strong and it was so floral

1176
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,039
that it would coat your teeth like from

1177
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,160
a joint nice and it's like I I have some

1178
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,000
of that we'll smoke some of that later

1179
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,960
hell yeah it was just it's like one of

1180
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,760
those ones where it's like and that's

1181
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,920
when it you know the like connoisseur

1182
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,520
flower it's grown at this level where

1183
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,318
you can't even get it that good every

1184
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,800
time you grow it that's what's so

1185
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:59,400
special and then like fresh fresh is the

1186
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,920
best turp loocks are great for

1187
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,039
preserving it you know we got Lance

1188
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,358
coming on the show soon again um but

1189
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,039
yeah I mean I think there's ways to

1190
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,838
preserve it where it's good but the best

1191
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,719
is that fresh fresh product especially

1192
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:15,119
if you like TPS yeah and I just feel

1193
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:17,399
like the effects are cleaner and uh yeah

1194
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,440
not as heavy I guess is the word maybe

1195
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,480
and I think it's cult ofar specific too

1196
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,760
no doubt yeah so some of the stuff last

1197
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,519
great for a long time and but the the

1198
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,440
stuff I really like like that Z mhm it's

1199
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,400
just when it's the freshest is the very

1200
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,960
best I don't know if I've ever tried

1201
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,240
straight Skittles uh it'll change your

1202
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,358
life like I've grown a lot of your

1203
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,199
crosses with it yeah but I've never

1204
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:39,880
actually tried it well the funny thing

1205
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,159
is a lot of those traits that you're

1206
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,318
looking for with the Skittles are

1207
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:44,799
recessive so if you smoke it like a lot

1208
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:45,920
of times in the progyny of the seeds

1209
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,280
that are crossed with it you're not

1210
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,358
going to get it right out the gate you

1211
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,839
have to do work with the breathing and

1212
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,078
like some of the back crosses have some

1213
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:54,480
of the Skittles stuff where it's Skitty

1214
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:56,280
but then the Skittles has the shitty

1215
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,559
structure right so it's always the ones

1216
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,040
that look the worst

1217
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:00,480
where you're like no that's not a good

1218
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,119
one but then you're like [ __ ] it smells

1219
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,440
good so yeah that's it's like there's so

1220
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,838
many times where you like you go through

1221
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,079
the room you're like that's the that's

1222
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,159
the one it looks like the one but then

1223
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,720
you got to smell it um and we go through

1224
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,799
rounds for feno hunting we go through

1225
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:16,039
the the rounds on the plant where we're

1226
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,160
like smelling them we're looking them a

1227
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,759
lot of times the ones that look the best

1228
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:22,598
aren't the ones that smell the best it's

1229
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,359
just that tradeoff yeah and then once

1230
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,880
you dry and cure them and then you have

1231
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:28,639
them in the bag that's when that's the

1232
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,280
real test right day it's like okay well

1233
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,759
let's line them all up and let's smoke

1234
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,319
them and compare them isn't it so much

1235
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,040
fun favorite thing it's totally amazing

1236
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,480
Christmas every day I love it where they

1237
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,400
it all lines up where it's like [ __ ] it

1238
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,358
looks amazing smells amazing tastes

1239
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,440
amazing it checks all these boxes and

1240
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:47,318
it's like wow and you go through 600

1241
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,720
plants and you might find 60 things that

1242
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:52,440
are worthy and then you might

1243
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:54,679
find five or six of those that are that

1244
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,240
are pretty stand itish that you want to

1245
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:59,558
keep running and so it's funny with F

1246
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:01,719
hunting so when you feno hunt is what's

1247
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,280
your typical seed like how many do you

1248
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:05,480
usually do per variety is it it depends

1249
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,040
it's every year we're doing different

1250
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,119
we're doing tons of stuff uh Outdoors

1251
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,759
we're doing stuff in different places

1252
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,240
I've been working in the Caribbean now

1253
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,680
and so next year we're going to be doing

1254
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:18,358
some uh variety testing and feno study

1255
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,519
down there to see what actually performs

1256
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:23,078
the best and I'm excited about that too

1257
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,000
cuz now we're looking at you know more

1258
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,760
of a tropical type climate where it's

1259
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,838
high humidity uh so stuff that has

1260
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,800
powdery milde resistance and petritis

1261
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,799
resistance it's going to stand out a lot

1262
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,119
definitely yeah anytime you're in that

1263
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:39,480
human environment that's warm it's like

1264
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:41,640
that's just a recipe for ruining your OG

1265
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,119
cush and that's basically the opposite

1266
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,639
of what y'all have here pretty much is

1267
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,559
it it's it's the opposite in a lot of

1268
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,639
ways you know it's so hard to dry and

1269
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,359
cure and store the flour correctly in

1270
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,920
those places it's totally possible right

1271
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,440
but you need a controlled environment to

1272
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,680
do it you can't just do it in a hut you

1273
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,358
have to spend some money you have to

1274
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:01,440
take some time and you have to do it

1275
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:03,039
correctly yeah and I think St Vincent

1276
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,200
and the Grenadines is this amazing place

1277
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:10,159
and they have this really amazing

1278
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:12,039
opportunity within the Cannabis space to

1279
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,239
impact the quality of life for the

1280
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,880
people there and it's being you know

1281
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,598
supervised by the government they're

1282
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,960
very supportive of medical cannabis nice

1283
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,318
and it's like great when you go to the

1284
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,079
government and they're like H how can we

1285
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:27,358
help our people instead of you guys are

1286
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:28,880
just annoying exactly over here we're

1287
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,318
just more or less annoying to the

1288
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,318
government you know it's we're not going

1289
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,480
away they know we're not going away but

1290
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,599
we're more like this thorn in the side

1291
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,960
of the government yeah whereas you know

1292
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,400
they they wish we could go away the

1293
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,838
redheaded stepchild oh absolutely

1294
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,358
whereas you know down in some of these

1295
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,039
places in the Caribbean and not not to

1296
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:47,400
say there's bad people in the government

1297
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:49,239
or there's not people that care because

1298
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,559
there is yeah right but down in the

1299
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,239
Caribbean the government and they have

1300
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,480
the the medical cannabis Authority the

1301
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:58,439
MCA and they are very very supportive of

1302
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,199
medical cannabis and how can we make our

1303
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,720
people healthier how can we take this

1304
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:05,399
plant and use it as medicine you know

1305
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:08,078
and I feel like they all recognize that

1306
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,920
the Island was built on the shoulders of

1307
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,119
cannabis Growers and how can we support

1308
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,440
our traditional Growers as well and so

1309
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,720
there's this different mindset down

1310
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,440
there and I love that I love the support

1311
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,879
by the government and the people in the

1312
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,760
government that talk so highly of

1313
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,358
cannabis that's beautiful you don't see

1314
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,800
that very many places you know no you

1315
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:28,759
know I think a lot of politicians are

1316
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,318
afraid CU they're lose votes you know

1317
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,880
and so that's got to change slowly but

1318
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:36,199
surely there's there's guys that we're

1319
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,200
not young anymore but there's guys that

1320
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,480
are young coming up that have very

1321
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:42,239
positive outlooks and I feel like slowly

1322
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,639
the old guys that are anti are going

1323
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,279
away and it's becoming normalized and

1324
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,719
it's not normalized fully but it's

1325
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,440
definitely becoming more normal yeah

1326
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:53,679
blows my mind it's 2025 almost I know

1327
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,000
it's we're still I'm still in an illegal

1328
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,399
State dude and then places like Texas I

1329
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,920
never thought it would be legal and they

1330
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,160
got CBD shops everywhere and they're

1331
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,599
selling flow everywhere it's wild that

1332
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:04,199
was something else I noticed in Prague

1333
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,160
when I was out there they had these

1334
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:09,118
cannabis shops all over the place yeah

1335
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:10,838
and it's only 1% but it's not really

1336
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,000
regulated so it's kind of like a wild

1337
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:14,920
west out there it's like a free-for-all

1338
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,760
totally but it's all the same flower too

1339
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,639
and it's all basic garbage well and

1340
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,960
these are steps to getting it normalized

1341
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:23,879
yeah right and so yeah even though and

1342
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,519
the Caribbean the flower that I saw for

1343
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,640
the most part was not that great mhm uh

1344
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:31,079
and also controlling the temperature and

1345
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,318
humidity in when you're storing it and

1346
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,000
you know like people carrying around

1347
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,159
showing people and using it it's like

1348
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,358
every time you open that jar you get

1349
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,279
humidity in flow and all of a sudden

1350
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:41,960
your turps are gone yep and you're left

1351
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,519
with something and a lot of it's Sun

1352
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,000
grown and not grown with proper

1353
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,119
nutrition

1354
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,920
typically and so you're not getting a

1355
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,280
super resinous product anyway but some

1356
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,200
of it was good and some of it has

1357
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,359
potential and I think the whole country

1358
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,000
has potential

1359
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,480
you know the whole island has potential

1360
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,960
to do great things that is such a neat

1361
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,358
project man yeah well it's like all we

1362
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,159
have to do is be right one time it's

1363
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,119
like we're going there to work with the

1364
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:11,078
government to do these breeding projects

1365
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,640
and I feel like we can go learn a lot

1366
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:14,798
about the plant I can learn a lot more

1367
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,920
about the plant working there than I

1368
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:18,639
could doing stuff here right you know

1369
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,079
it's like we can do a lot here too but I

1370
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,639
can do it here and do it there at the

1371
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,720
same time and you know the potential for

1372
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,798
collaboration with other International

1373
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,199
Brands is huge I think there's other

1374
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,679
people that are in the same mindset that

1375
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,719
we can go in and we can make a

1376
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,519
difference and I love working with

1377
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,838
people that have that same belief like

1378
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,759
it's doesn't have to be about money it

1379
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,960
doesn't have to be just about money it

1380
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,559
can be about making a difference for the

1381
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,240
people and building the community from

1382
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:46,480
the inside exactly give them the plant

1383
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,479
medicine you know I'm not going there to

1384
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,838
sell them seeds that I make here I want

1385
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,519
to go there and I want to help them

1386
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:53,558
breed seeds so they can create seeds on

1387
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,159
the island for themselves and Infuse

1388
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:57,720
that money into the community and I

1389
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,639
think that

1390
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,639
there's so much benefit I'll get so much

1391
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,798
benefit out of doing that too it's like

1392
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:05,358
oh yeah you know besides feeling good

1393
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:07,239
besides you know feeling and knowing

1394
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:08,798
like that's what you're supposed to like

1395
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:11,279
I feel like that's what I'm supposed to

1396
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:13,239
be doing here I know that that's part of

1397
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,079
my reason that I'm on this planet is to

1398
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:18,439
do good things and do things like that I

1399
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,400
agree totally yeah I feel the same way

1400
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,480
like feel like this plant found me in a

1401
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,280
way you know I've been growing for

1402
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,880
almost 30 years now yeah and every

1403
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,880
everything from crawl spaces to attics

1404
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,400
to basement you know wherever I could

1405
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,559
find a space when you're on the right

1406
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,160
path you know it I feel like start

1407
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,359
things start to line up yeah and if if

1408
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,199
things aren't lining up you need to

1409
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,558
re-evaluate your situation and see what

1410
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,318
you're doing wrong but like when you're

1411
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,880
doing the right thing a lot of times

1412
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:46,719
things will start lining up for you out

1413
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,640
of nowhere all these things are lining

1414
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,159
up you know some of these long shot

1415
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,920
things are like wow this is really

1416
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,920
coming together like 100% I was on stage

1417
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,240

00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,280
hopefully Infuse hundreds of millions of

1425
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,119
dollars over the next 10 years that's

1426
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,280
incredible yeah and it's great and it's

1427
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:19,720
like but it takes more than just

1428
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,200

00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,119
beautiful thing about this plan is it

1443
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:49,239
brings people together you know totally

1444
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,318
it's like nobody gets this excited about

1445
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:54,000
tomatoes but Canabis is tomato Farmers

1446
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,639
yeah well you don't know any tomato

1447
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,559
farmers do you yeah but I think actually

1448
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,039
yeah I've made similar jokes around

1449
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,200
tomato Farmers they're like actually

1450
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,199
actually tomato farmers do get this

1451
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,279
excited about tomatoes and I get so I

1452
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,039
grow heirloom tomatoes right every year

1453
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,920
I grow heirlooms in my backyard and this

1454
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:16,759
year was no exception um and we grew

1455
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,960
some awesome awesome tomatoes and I get

1456
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,359
excited to eat heirloom tomatoes I love

1457
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,679
fresh heirloom tomatoes that have never

1458
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:25,880
been refrigerated you just can't get

1459
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,039
that quality in the store and uh for me

1460
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,119
it's like I don't know where I'd be

1461
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,440
without tomatoes I know and not only do

1462
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,599
they taste so good but you feel like

1463
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,440
when you're eating them it's just so

1464
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,119
good for you you know all the flavors

1465
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,920
when they're so clean the flavors are so

1466
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,680
clean and they're sweet and they're not

1467
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,960
mine aren't very acidic the heirlooms I

1468
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:43,078
get are very flavorful they're very

1469
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,358
sweet there's a little bit of acid but

1470
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,400
it's not like when you refrigerate them

1471
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:49,000
that you get this uh acid that comes out

1472
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,280
of I can't remember what the chemical is

1473
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,838
called but Ryan's going to put it up on

1474
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,000
the screen for you guys right now no no

1475
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:56,838
but they do use ethylene to ripen yeah

1476
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,119
okay okay yeah but with the you

1477
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:02,078
refrigerate them it creates this this

1478
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,480
chemical compound that changes them okay

1479
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,519
chemically and so they have a different

1480
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,559
flavor oh I didn't know that what kind

1481
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,759
of varieties did you grow we do some

1482
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:13,640
purple varieties we do

1483
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,920
uh we always do a cherry we do uh

1484
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:18,118
kamanche I believe it's called okay we

1485
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,639
do uh then we do like a hybrid beef

1486
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,720
steak but typically it's heirlooms have

1487
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,159
you ever done a Cherokee purple Cherokee

1488
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:25,719
purple that's what we did okay yeah

1489
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,798
that's a great one that's a really good

1490
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:29,919
one that's actually out from where I'm

1491
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:31,519
from out in North Carolina that's a good

1492
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,639
one so those are great and they grow in

1493
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,039
most places and they they yield pretty

1494
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:37,358
good I think they they've been around

1495
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,000
forever and I think they're they're one

1496
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,558
of the most flavorful too and if you do

1497
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,199
with a little bit of Bara a little bit

1498
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,319
of fresh basil that you grow on your own

1499
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,078
property oh yeah some fresh olive oil

1500
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:49,599
and fresh balsamic yeah that I could eat

1501
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:52,599
that every day I know so yeah and then

1502
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,280
uh you're in Tennessee mhm you are

1503
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:59,318
expanding to Europe too as far we are uh

1504
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,280
cuz so the th CA Market here that uh we

1505
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:04,880
created kind of like two or three years

1506
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,720
ago um since then the CBD market for

1507
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,440
flower has kind of gone downhill in the

1508
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:11,519
US so being that's all we can grow in

1509
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,159
Tennessee at our two facilities we had

1510
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,519
the branch out and so I've been focused

1511
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:18,118
on finding other outlets for a flower

1512
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:20,759
yeah and fortunate enough we have in the

1513
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,519
last six months I went to London for a

1514
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,599
Expo out there met some people and then

1515
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,400
um slowly but surely I don't know if it

1516
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,079
was the emerald cup wins or what but in

1517
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,400
the last 6 months flow Gardens has

1518
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:36,119
developed quite traction out in the UK

1519
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,119
especially but also in Europe so that's

1520
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,760
awesome yeah we're trying man we're just

1521
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:41,838
trying it's a family based business my

1522
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,200
mom works there you know my sister runs

1523
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,480
the other facility so that's the best

1524
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:49,318
trying to keep everybody fed and going

1525
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,960
yeah it's not easy no it's not no a lot

1526
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:52,920
of people don't understand it's not it's

1527
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,240
not all roses no we actually we're

1528
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,039
starting up another facility uh up in

1529
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:59,000
Virginia where we can grow the thca

1530
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:02,159
because they're starting to change the

1531
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,838
laws in Tennessee now oh wow so I mean

1532
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:05,558
it's it's tough It's like if you don't

1533
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,480
like roller coasters yeah you don't need

1534
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,400
to be in this industry because it's all

1535
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,639
over it is and you if you don't like

1536
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,318
stress I feel that that's just also

1537
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:15,039
owning a business there's always stress

1538
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:17,279
you got to of course you be the master

1539
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:20,000
of stress but not having a clear Runway

1540
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,720
is the worst yeah you're basically just

1541
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,280
every month na they keep moving the

1542
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,719
needle and it's like okay you're

1543
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,960
compliant and then you got to do this

1544
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,519
new thing to be compliant again

1545
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,119
keep on you know and I mean that's just

1546
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:32,440
part of the business yeah and it's

1547
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:35,200
always going to be like that exactly and

1548
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,039
it's a vol business yeah yeah but I mean

1549
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,159
I love the plant so much there's no way

1550
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,960
I could ever think about doing anything

1551
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:42,440
else at this point well it's great when

1552
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,039
you can wake up in the morning and be

1553
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,599
excited to to work even when it's

1554
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,680
stressful yeah it never gets old like I

1555
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,880
said every day is like Christmas you and

1556
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,239
it's there's always something new to

1557
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,760
learn and [ __ ] breaks every day yeah

1558
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,118
problems there's always problem floods

1559
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,280
floods you guys get floods yeah I mean

1560
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,920
we're known as flood Gardens half the

1561
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:08,599
time you know it's just uh it is what it

1562
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:11,079
is it's part of it yeah I mean in the

1563
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:13,000
yeah it's it's interesting well how's

1564
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:14,839
power out there is it expensive you know

1565
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,400
it's not that bad we're out in the

1566
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,920
country uh I want to throw out a number

1567
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,000
I think it's like 11 cents a kilowatt or

1568
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,880
something cheap yeah not as cheap as

1569
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,519
Washington some areas in Washington are

1570
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,079
like I think seven or nine cents yeah

1571
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:30,798
but even still that's just so cheap

1572
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,280
compared to here yeah it's definitely

1573
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,960
I'd say so like San Francisco is super

1574
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,960
expensive we went out to dinner last

1575
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,119
night and I was like wow yeah it's like

1576
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,798
20 bucks for a salad okay yeah and it's

1577
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:44,400
about that big yeah exactly but but yeah

1578
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,000
and the food's good I mean it's all

1579
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,440
there and I feel like that's the thing

1580
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,920
with food though there's there's a price

1581
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,440
point for everybody you want to go spend

1582
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,200
$100 on a salad I know a spot yeah for

1583
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,798
that same small salad well not same it's

1584
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:57,000
going to be different probably less

1585
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:00,559
ingredients

1586
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,318
more organic and $100 and $100 yeah and

1587
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,400
that's just the salad jeez yeah the

1588
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:07,519
bread is probably $20 so you were a chef

1589
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,160
right oh yeah yeah I was a chef for

1590
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:12,838
years um on and off and I mean I still

1591
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:15,318

1594
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,559

1595
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:23,639
I just just because I'm not I prefer

1596
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:26,680
smoking and eating me too and I'm not

1597

1598
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:30,879
dinner so that I'm high an hour and a

1599
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:33,079
half later exactly that just doesn't for

1600
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,440
me it doesn't appeal to me putting tpin

1601
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:37,798
in or frying some fan leaves that sounds

1602
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,760
cool you know some deep fried fan leaves

1603
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:41,838
yeah never tried that panko crusted fan

1604
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,640
leaves I mean sure or or even just

1605
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,558
frying them crisp like there's all kinds

1606
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:47,960
of cool things you can do with cannabis

1607
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:50,400
that I think would be great but as far

1608
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,400
as infusing like infusing dinners aren't

1609
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,559
my thing yeah no I get that so I'm a

1610
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,519
lightweight when it comes to Edibles I

1611
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,440
love rosin yummies I love the T I've had

1612
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:01,280
some of those before I think they're

1613
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,480
from out here I had them gifted to me

1614
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,039
they were delicious rosin does they they

1615
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,480
did these white Thorn Rose ones and it's

1616
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,520
like they they added no flavor it was

1617
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,000
the flavor of the turpins and it was

1618
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,199
that white Thorn rose that was just so

1619
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,920
can you tell me a little bit about that

1620
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,798
I've heard so much about that strain

1621
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,960
like what's the flavor on it I've been

1622
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:21,239
dying to dry it so yeah it's Unique it's

1623
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,199
got like a a nice floral character but

1624
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:26,479
it's like it's not just the flavor that

1625
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:29,798
makes it so special it's flal floral

1626
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,599
it's vanilla it's it's purple flower

1627
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:34,599
right a gorgeous plant it's a gorgeous

1628
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:37,400
looking plant it's about the effect it's

1629
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:38,960
special it's beyond special because I

1630
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,519
call it Feelgood weed you can call

1631
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,838
whatever you want but for me it's that

1632
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:44,239
one I could smoke in the morning the

1633
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:45,519
afternoon the evening I can smoke it

1634
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,000
when I'm in a good mood I can smoke it

1635
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,599
when I'm in a bad mood and it still

1636
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,599
makes me feel good and I feel like if

1637
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:54,880
more people were able to try it they

1638
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:56,599
would all like cannabis like I feel like

1639
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,440
some people they might get a experience

1640
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,960
because they got too high or whatever

1641
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,480
this is not one of those things you

1642
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,599
don't necessarily get too high but you

1643
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,519
get you get the right High you get the

1644
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,960
right effect yeah and there's only a

1645
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:08,880
handful of things I've experienced in my

1646
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,400
life that have that where it's like you

1647
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,720
smoke it and you feel amazing almost

1648
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,480
like euphoric it's almost euphoric but

1649
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:18,519
you just feel really really good and

1650
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,358
it's you're not tight behind the eyes

1651
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:22,880
you're not you know your your face isn't

1652
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:24,639
tight in any way shape or form you it

1653
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,640
relaxes you if anything you feel really

1654
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:29,239
relaxed and you feel happy

1655
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,239
and I think the world needs more of that

1656
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:32,639
100% I agree you know and there's

1657
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:34,118
nothing wrong with the anxiety we

1658
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:35,480
there's somebody who likes it you know

1659
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:38,599
there's definitely people who like that

1660
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,240
stuff yeah but uh you know and the the

1661
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:42,079
further along we get with these these

1662
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:44,159
breeding projects that people are doing

1663
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,359
I think the more we discover what's out

1664
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:48,279
there and there's people that are

1665
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:50,318
prioritizing effect I think there are a

1666
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,960
lot of people that prioritize the way it

1667
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:54,759
tastes or the way it looks but a lot of

1668
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,159
people need to go back to that effect

1669
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,400
how does it make you feel all right I

1670
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,038
agree totally because I've had venos

1671
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,358
like that that were just you know

1672
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:04,400
beautiful but the effects just weren't

1673
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:06,440
there you know so therefore I don't put

1674
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,720
that one in production yeah you know it

1675
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,400
has to have that feel like you said to

1676
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:11,879
feel good we don't need another Oreos

1677
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,798
like that that just looks good doesn't

1678
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,559
tastes great purple punch same thing

1679
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:17,559
it's like I'm I'm super anti-p purple

1680
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:19,319
punch but again these things are one

1681
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:21,359
step away from being great you just need

1682
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:23,358
to be worked you know and I think purple

1683
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,358
punch makes some great crosses that have

1684
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:27,880
great effect but as far as by itself

1685
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:29,759
like these things where they're they're

1686
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,000
we call them cardboard TPS yeah

1687
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,599
cardboard you fire it up and it's like

1688
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,318
you almost taste flavor and then like

1689
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:37,798
for Oreos it's just not a good flavor I

1690
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,239
don't I don't enjoy the flavor I love

1691
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:41,159
the way it looks I think it looks great

1692
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:43,199
it's great Instagram flow yeah just

1693
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:44,798
muted you know nothing special yeah

1694
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,439
nothing special nothing special about

1695
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:50,880
the effect or about the the way it

1696
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:54,639
tastes I'm uh growing some ice block

1697
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,798
from Third Coast it's Oreos and

1698
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,480
blackberry blockberry yeah yeah that

1699
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,519
blockberry is pretty good it's got some

1700
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,199
special traits super vigorous plants

1701
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:04,960
like huge fan leaves um haven't tried it

1702
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:08,519
yet we just harvested a couple plants

1703
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:11,760
last week but and yeah they're good it's

1704
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:13,719
um real like punch breath have you you

1705
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,440
tried that one before it's just like

1706
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:17,239
fruit punch

1707
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,599
overtones really good I don't think I've

1708
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:21,479
tried punch breath another one Cadillac

1709
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,838
rainbows that one I've never had

1710
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,960
Cadillac rainbows sounds Co it smells

1711
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:27,960
like garlic and onions and it just fills

1712
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,199
the room it's probably the most pungent

1713
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:33,079
flower I've smelled in a while that's a

1714
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:34,798
good one nice but once again anxiety

1715
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:36,200
right yeah yeah it's funny and there's

1716
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,358
so many directions you can go with

1717
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:40,399
effect too it's like it's not either a

1718
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:42,159
cative or stimula it's not just I mean

1719
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,400
we can people box them in these things

1720
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,118
Indica sativa it's like no there's all

1721
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,079
these different effects exact some give

1722
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,559
you the munchies like crazy like there's

1723
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,039
specific things I've been dieting right

1724
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:53,039
and I lost a bunch of weight there's

1725
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:55,240
things I cannot smoke there's specific

1726
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,440
cultivars that grown by my friends I

1727
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:58,879
love the way they taste I love the way

1728
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,119
they smoke but then they make me want to

1729
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,079
go clear out the fridge literally raid

1730
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,000
the fridge at 2 in the morning yeah you

1731
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:07,400
know so I can't do that I can't do those

1732
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,440
ones and some of the yeah I mean I think

1733
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,400
GDP is the one it's one of those ones

1734
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:15,079
that always made me hungry all the time

1735
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,838
and so I prefer the other but then I got

1736
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:19,559
this boost pen that's thcv I don't know

1737
01:02:16,838 --> 01:02:21,639
if you're growing any thcv uh a little

1738
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,960
bit not really though so there's this

1739
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:27,400
this pen that my friends gave me from

1740
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:29,599
House of coltivar and and it's this new

1741
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:33,798
thcv pen it's got some other stuff in it

1742
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:36,599
too other canono uh T specific turpins

1743
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:38,199
and it made me have not only did it make

1744
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:40,359
me have anxiety but it definitely didn't

1745
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:41,480
make me hungry it made me feel sick and

1746
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:42,880
I was thinking it was something else

1747
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:45,440
that was making me sick I thought maybe

1748
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,559
I was getting sick my stomach was

1749
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,200
twisting and literally went in the

1750
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,760
bathroom and like dry heaved a little

1751
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,879
bit and I'm like oh man couldn't figure

1752
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:56,559
out what it was well I felt better after

1753
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,278
a little bit and and then I went and

1754
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:00,240
took another hit and I'm like [ __ ] it's

1755
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:02,440
it's the pen damn pen it's the pen this

1756
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:05,159
thing's wild and it's like a to it's a

1757
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,720
weight loss pen so they've they've

1758
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:08,118
they've got this pen and I think

1759
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:09,399
probably I was hitting it like I was

1760
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:11,480
trying to feel better when my stomach

1761
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,639
was obsess I'm hitting it more thinking

1762
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,838
that it's going to help and it was

1763
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,598
actually making me feel sicker that's

1764
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:17,798
crazy and I don't think it has that

1765
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:20,480
effect and that's the other thing with

1766
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:22,440
cannabis it's there's like this effect

1767
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,639
that because our body chemistries are so

1768
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,400
different like how it affects me and how

1769
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:29,480
it affects you could be completely two

1770
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,720
different things I know it's wild 20

1771
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,400
years from now hopefully they'll have

1772
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,480
all that figured out you know what I

1773
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,920
mean once they can do some research yeah

1774
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,798
there there's so much to it but there's

1775
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,119
that Feelgood weed where I I think most

1776
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:43,480

01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:56,639
people a lot of people yeah yeah as you

1809
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,480
get older more and more people you

1810
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,400
experience losing their lives to cancer

1811
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,440
unfortunately one more reason why we do

1812
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,400
this you know yeah I mean I'm not a big

1813
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:07,480
tobacco smoker one of my friends died of

1814
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,720
esophageal cancer and that got me off

1815
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:13,000
tobacco for the most part yeah I'll

1816
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:14,959
smoke a good cigar every once in a while

1817
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,599
but I'm not a cigarette smoker can't do

1818
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,720
it even even when I'm drinking I won't

1819
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:20,278
smoke cigarettes just see I used to and

1820
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,318
that's what it was my crutch when I was

1821
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:25,358
drinking i' I'd want to SM smoke a

1822
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,000
cigarette you know finally got past that

1823
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:30,078
yeah I got off most of the drinking I

1824
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,880
very rarely drink I got I got a bunch of

1825
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,000
clean and sober guys in my circle Rue

1826
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,640
he's another one from Texas he uh yeah

1827
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,079
he's he's a good influence on me he

1828
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:42,358

1829
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,000
him and elanur those guys are both sober

1830
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:47,078
nice you know it's great having guys

1831
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,719
that are sober uh you know because it's

1832
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:50,039
it's one of those things you know peer

1833
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:51,358
pressure whatever but when you're in a

1834
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:53,640
circle of friends and everybody drinks

1835
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,679
and you're the guy that doesn't drink a

1836
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:57,199
lot of times it's harder sometimes it's

1837
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,399
easy if you have a medical condition or

1838
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:00,679
something like that but if you don't oh

1839
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,200
well what's a beer going to do or what's

1840
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:03,798
this going to do for me it's like about

1841
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:05,278
health and I'm trying to like lose more

1842
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:07,838
weight I feel like I've lost a bunch I

1843
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:09,440
still have a bunch to go yeah I love

1844
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,199
that the older we get that's we have to

1845
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,278
focus on that you know dude Health you

1846
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:14,679
can't eat cheeseburgers all day anymore

1847
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:17,519
health is wealth although I do love a

1848
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:18,759
good Smash Burger no doubt so yeah yeah

1849
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,278
defin then you got to watch out for gout

1850
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,880
when you get older that's the other

1851
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:24,960
thing God will kill you exactly so yeah

1852
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,240
it's funny it's like you you can't win

1853
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,880
for losing I know man we can try yeah

1854
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:33,558
for sure so yeah so if you

1855
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,200
had one thing that you could tell your

1856
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:39,240
younger self what would that one thing

1857
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:41,159
be just be patient and and know you're

1858
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:45,038
going to fail and just keep moving

1859
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:46,598
forward yeah you know no matter what

1860
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,039
yeah sometimes that's all you can do

1861
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:51,000
yeah I've done it my whole life

1862
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,559
and can't believe I'm sitting here

1863
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,838
talking to you right now and I'm in the

1864
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,400
hemp space you know it's it's crazy so

1865
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,159
it's a beautiful thing that the hemp

1866
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,960
space is a thing it's even possible it's

1867
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:06,399
like uh you know before 2018 it wasn't

1868
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,000
even possible no and so and then even

1869
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,480
200 it was Rocky for the first couple

1870
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,920
years it was weird like that's when I

1871
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,318
started was around 2017 I remember them

1872
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,519
passing it in 2018 and yeah all my

1873
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,558
people were like yeah yeah you know but

1874
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:21,239
we still at that point didn't even

1875
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,119
fathom thca being a thing you know we're

1876
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:26,118
just glad to sell the CBD

1877
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,720
under3 and how it's evolved it's it's

1878
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:30,318
kind of funny to sit back and look at it

1879
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:32,798
now you know it's just well then Delta 8

1880
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:35,759
got wild minute that stuff is like

1881
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:38,880
garbage it's terrible well I think the

1882
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,480
Delta 8 by itself as a molecule is just

1883
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,838
fine I think that the problem is is

1884
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,119
people take their [ __ ] and they process

1885
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:46,599
their [ __ ] into delta8 because they

1886
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,119
can't do anything else with it right and

1887
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:50,640
so they have the [ __ ] distillate delta8

1888
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,599
yeah and then they put that in gummies

1889
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,719
and all these other things it's like but

1890
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:56,640
by itself delta8 is a great molecule

1891
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,798
like as far as the effect it's it's a

1892
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,759
fifth as strong as Delta 9

1893
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:04,480
THC uh I think it has value but I think

1894
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,039
that we're not focusing on it in the

1895
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,880
right ways yeah I mean for me I took a

1896
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,160
gummy once of Delta 8 and it hit

1897
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,920
extremely hard it was great giggling

1898
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,119
like the first time you ever were high

1899
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,199
yeah and then the hangover set in and it

1900
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:20,039
just it basically the next day I just

1901
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:21,838
felt like garbage and that was just my

1902
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:24,158
experience yeah I'm big on like the 25

1903
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,000
milligram Delta 8s that I know where the

1904
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,318
delta8 was sourced through

1905
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,238
reliable source and I felt good from

1906
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,000
Delta 8 I I I feel like it's very mild

1907
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:35,479
and it helps me sleep whereas Delta 9 I

1908
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
cannot sleep on Delta 9 for myself right

1909
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:39,278
or I can but it's after I've been high

1910
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,158
for a bunch and then I crash right yeah

1911
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:43,759
so yeah I like the mild effect of Delta

1912
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:46,679
8 U but there's so many other canabo

1913
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:50,640
that are great yeah so thca is a good

1914
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:53,960
one it is CBG is I like CBG a lot I have

1915
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,600
a great CBG variety it's like

1916
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,838
19% I need that so B I'll send it to you

1917
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,480
I need that for smoking for myself okay

1918
01:08:58,838 --> 01:09:02,158
yeah I'll send you some I have not found

1919
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,678
super turpy

1920
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,960
CG I've yet to find stuff that's really

1921
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:08,719
turpy that holds high levels of CBG but

1922
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,719
I think that's that's on the project

1923
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,359
list for the next couple years I worked

1924
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,319
on it for a minute doing different cbgs

1925
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,199
um I tried Crossing them with THC and

1926
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:19,920
then didn't realize that all the CBG

1927
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:24,678
would just convert over because it's a

1928
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:27,679
stem cell um but I did finally find um

1929
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:29,838
this particular feno CBG we named it

1930
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,158
white cheddar because it it had a tpine

1931
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:33,479
profile not a crazy one but yeah

1932
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,798
probably the only one I've ever found

1933
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:37,599
and it does smell like kind like white

1934
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:39,198
cheddar popcorn yeah uh great effects

1935
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,079
though it's like a cup of coffee or

1936
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:44,000
something very good I'll definitely send

1937
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:45,519
you some yeah I'm all about that

1938
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,838
caffeine weed too as long as it doesn't

1939
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,600
make my heart race exactly yeah no this

1940
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:51,798
one doesn't and it's good to mix with

1941
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,440
other flowers as well so what's

1942
01:09:51,798 --> 01:09:54,880
interesting cuz like rosin I can smoke

1943
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,559
rosin first thing in the morning I'm

1944
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,000
super clearheaded and I go to the gym

1945
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,199
and I work out and I feel great and I

1946
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,719
don't feel high but if I was to smoke a

1947
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:03,919
big joint right before I go to the gym

1948
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:06,158
I'm not as motivated to work out hard

1949
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,199
for whatever reason maybe it's the smoke

1950
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:10,639
maybe it's it could be it could be but

1951
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:12,759
it's for it could be the smoke my lungs

1952
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,440
I don't know but like one good dab and I

1953
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,640
feel like I'm on nice GNA try that yeah

1954
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:19,919
that's the way to go we got our dude so

1955
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,119
like this thing right here this is the

1956
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:27,440
ays from Focus V with the new atomizer

1957
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:30,640
okay this thing's great uh is that a

1958
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:33,399
flower is that dry no this is this is

1959
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,119
rosin extract yeah this is this is my

1960
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:38,479
rosin it's a instead of a rosin cart we

1961
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:41,079
now have a mini dab rig that you can go

1962
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,919
super portable nice uh there's a handful

1963
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:46,359
of them on the market that are

1964
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,359
good has packs I think packs they came

1965
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:50,079
out with a little small one yeah yeah

1966
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:52,039
yeah I mean then there's like dip device

1967
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,319
has this flower one too we we'll show

1968
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:56,960
this on the show give these guys a shout

1969
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,840
out and it's like a volcano in a pen

1970
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,920
which is kind of cool like if you're all

1971
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:02,880
about that old school volcano yeah

1972
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:05,000
actually have a ventti from stores and

1973
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,440
bigel that I use that's pretty good yeah

1974
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,079
I like that one a lot and this is more

1975
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:10,799
convenient this I mean this is just like

1976
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:13,760
pack and go super easy I like the size

1977
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,920
of it too very convenient yeah but the

1978
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,039
temperature control of this thing is

1979
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,560
great that's what I love about it

1980
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:20,840
temperature control and it's like having

1981
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:22,560
a dab rig without the water um okay

1982
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,360
which I don't need water for my dabs but

1983
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,960
I love this and I can sit in the car

1984
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:28,238
right when I go into the gym take a nice

1985
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,880
fat one exactly and feel great start

1986
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:32,000
your day it's a great way to start the

1987
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,039
day I think good rosin 2 is like it

1988
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,238
makes me super clear-headed especially

1989
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:37,399
if I'm doing something in repetition

1990
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:39,399
like I'm lifting weights then I can

1991
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:41,920
really focus on the muscles that I'm

1992
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:43,559
trying to Target nice or the cardio and

1993
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,399
I can get into the music and not have to

1994
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:48,840
worry about my feet moving or whatever

1995
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:51,679
you know nice I'm gonna try that yeah

1996
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,319
makes sense so as far as breeding you're

1997
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,319
making seeds now you have some available

1998
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:58,639
on your website yeah yeah so we have

1999
01:11:55,319 --> 01:12:01,319
have um mostly type two seeds some type

2000
01:11:58,639 --> 01:12:03,480
three seeds uh and then a couple type

2001
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:06,479
one seeds so I mainly focus on type two

2002
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:10,839
seeds breeding a CBD genetic and then a

2003
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:13,759
THC genetic together um yeah I'm getting

2004
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:16,360
a lot of different profiles and for me I

2005
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,079
feel like the effects are really

2006
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:22,559
clear-headed no anxiety no paranoia so

2007
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:24,679
the people that are THC sensitive this

2008
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,560
these type twos are kind of where it's

2009
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:28,279
at really cool you got to get on on some

2010
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,960
