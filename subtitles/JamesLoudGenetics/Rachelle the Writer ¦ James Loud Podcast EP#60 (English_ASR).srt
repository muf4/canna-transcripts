29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,118
some writers that have big Egos and I

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,719
feel you're not one of them so I I love

31
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:10,799
that about you I think you do a great

32
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,359
job with your

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,640
articles um yeah it's amazing stuff no I

34
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,079
appreciate that I try really really hard

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,359
uh to stay humble because I come from

36
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,798
humble beginnings right and so and

37
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,799
honestly like this is not about me this

38
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,640
is about you and the community right

39
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,280
it's it's a team effort so yeah and you

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,439
know writing so writing a breeding book

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,399
I got my uh hands dirty or my feet wet

42
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:37,078
writing a book took me five years but I

43
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,680
learned I think by the end of the book I

44
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,559
really learned how to take my ego out of

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,479
it and try to write the book for people

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,799
I don't know that I got everything right

47
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,239
there's stuff that I definitely got

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,719
wrong but I did the best I could and I

49
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:53,560
there it was a contribution of more than

50
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:56,280
20 people's work and a lot of fun and

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,680
yeah I I am glad that I did it and it's

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,599
done and I don't have to do it again

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,560
it's a lot more work I think Than People

54
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,199
realize I have a lot of people coming to

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,159
me like oh I want to maybe write a book

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,959
or whatever and I say it's not just

57
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,599
about typing right it's really about

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,319
putting passion and knowledge and then

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,759
you have to Market it and like edit it

60
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,679
and there's just so much that goes into

61
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,280
it so five years is quite a journey um

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,719
but I'm super stoked for you that you

63
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,800
got it across the Finish Line I know you

64
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,359
gave me a copy uh at weed week I loved

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,920
it and I was actually at the hydro store

66
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
down the road right before I came here

67
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,359
and I saw a bunch of copies of your book

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,959
sitting out on the counter I was like

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
sick this a full circle moment yeah it's

70
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,439
it's great and you know I've written

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,640
articles and I you know I had I've

72
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,840
gotten my hands dirty with articles

73
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,238
before I written for a bunch of

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,800
Publications and I think I've written

75
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,000
some good stuff but it's it's really

76
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,159
about

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,840
inserting uh something special in each

78
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:51,000
article to really highlight the the

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,640
person or what you're writing about and

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,878
you know and and also just not writing

81
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,279
to write I think that's another thing

82
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,239
totally it's kind of for me like doing a

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,120
puzzle right like I listen to the

84
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,759
person's story and I'll look for that

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,120
narrative and that Arc and then I'll

86
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,399
pull the quotes and I'll put it all

87
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,039
together how did you do it when you were

88
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,480
writing articles like did you follow

89
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,318
that same formula or what was your

90
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,000
process you know I I reverse engineer

91
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,759
everything in my life right that's just

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,719
how I do stuff and so I start with a

93
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,878
bunch of uh bullet points and then I

94
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,919
start trying to fill in the bullet

95
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:22,639
points that's what I did with the book

96
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,639
too like that's just I did it in the

97
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,878
same way that I I read an article when I

98
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,958
tried to tackle the book in the

99
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,878
beginning and I wrote five versions of

100
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,080
the book before it was done like

101
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:35,158
literally I scratched the first version

102
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,239
completely um well I wouldn't say

103
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,719
completely I had a you know obviously

104
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,360
there was knowledge in my head that was

105
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,158
put back on the paper but like what was

106
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,480
written 30,000 words the the book is

107
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:50,239
115,000 words total and so the first

108
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:53,119
30,000 I believe it was close to 30 got

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,840
scrapped and so we had to redo it and

110
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,519
that's when I thought I knew how to

111
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,560
write a good breeding book and I thought

112
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,680
I knew what I was doing and I had no

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,878
idea especially once I read it and I was

114
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,079
like this is not worth putting out to

115
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,679
the world cuz at the end of the day

116
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,159
writing is an art I think that there's

117
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,760
the art behind it and I also feel like

118
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,560
uh when you have something that's art

119
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,199
all you can do is the best you can do

120
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,959
then you got to put it out to the world

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,759
and the world judges it and the world

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,519
accepts it and appreciates it and it's

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
one of those things and that's what I

124
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,359
love about books that's what I love

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
about articles and articles it's almost

126
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,439
more subtle because you're writing about

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,960
somebody else and so you're having to

128
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,199
figure out how to highlight that person

129
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,478
the best way

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,720
possible um and you know and there's so

131
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:39,639
many angles to that how do you do it

132
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,320
honestly it's a lot of pressure

133
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,840
especially when I really like and

134
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,279
respect the person that I'm writing

135
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,879
about because I so desperately want to

136
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,719
get it right and try to do right by them

137
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,199
and amplify them in the way that they

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,800
want to be heard right and I've actually

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,800
been really really fortunate that I've

140
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,360
been able to successfully write articles

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
that people really love I've never

142
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,439
really had much push back or you

143
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,198
misquoted me or anything like that cuz

144
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,560
I've heard horror stories from other

145
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,439
writers who you know they put out

146
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,879
something and then their subject was

147
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,240
upset about how they came off or how

148
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,240
they were presented and oh that's

149
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,600
happened to me before too for sure yeah

150
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,400
it's I I'm just like so grateful but the

151
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,879
pressure is is difficult and it gives me

152
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,560
anxiety sometimes like I'll avoid

153
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,360
writing the actual article because I put

154
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,000
so much pressure on myself but what I

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,479
try to do is just speak from the heart

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,319
that's always what I do and I feel like

157
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,918
if I can do that and capture someone's

158
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,240
Essence their truth will come through

159
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,159
yeah authenticity is so important

160
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,439
totally and capturing authenticity is

161
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,960
even harder yeah right and that's I I

162
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,399
think people just don't get how hard it

163
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,879
is to actually CCH capture authenticity

164
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,159
because that's just it's like one thing

165
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,560
telling a story and then capturing the

166
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,280
authentic side of it and that just it

167
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,280
speaks so highly of these authors that

168
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,239
do it I mean some of them have big egos

169
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,079
too that do good job you know but like

170
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,519
and there are some really good writers

171
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,079
out there you know we're we're in a

172
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,839
special time because we've we've kind of

173
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,879
gone away from print not completely

174
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,679
because we're still doing print and

175
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,279
you're you're doing print you're doing

176
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,199
online digital stuff you're doing a

177
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,879
little bit of everything but we've gone

178
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,000
into like this Mass Spectrum of

179
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,719
different forms of media you know social

180
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,439
media we have magazines still we have

181
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,800
digital magazines there's just so many

182
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,079
different versions of stuff that you can

183
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,079
read and get information from yeah and

184
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,240
that's been a really interesting

185
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,279
evolution especially with social media

186
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,199
as a journalist especially working um in

187
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,239
print it's kind of a Dying art in a way

188
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,319
but there's still something really

189
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,639
special and magical about having a print

190
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,080
copy I mean I'm sure when you got your

191
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,439
book for the first time you know a

192
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,918
special feeling yeah exactly and so I

193
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,639
love being able to give that gift to

194
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,279
people I actually we did a special

195
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,439
insert for 420 uh we distributed it to a

196
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,918
bunch of dispensaries and then it was in

197
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,319
the Sunday edition of the San Francisco

198
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,598
Chronicle it went out all across San

199
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
Francisco and a couple of the stories

200
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:03,959
that were in there I didn't tell the

201
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,879
people that were the subjects that it

202
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,120
would be there and then they were

203
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,240
surprised like wow I'm in the chronicle

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,120
this legendary newspaper it was a really

205
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,519
cool gift to give to them yeah that's

206
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,160
awesome yeah it's really special yeah

207
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:20,399
totally um how did you get your start in

208
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,039
writing in cannabis in cannabis writing

209
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,120
I guess let's take it back did you start

210
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:27,759
writing in high school and you start

211
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,519
with journals and then writing in school

212
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,879
or how did it go well it's interesting I

213
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,079
always had a passion for writing when I

214
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,759
was young I would write a lot of poetry

215
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,079
and short stories and I would Journal a

216
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,639
lot but I never really thought about

217
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,959
writing as a career in fact I actually

218
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,720
studied early childhood education and

219
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:49,478
social justice and I was working as a

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,800
teacher wow for many many years and I

221
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,959
actually ended up getting arrested not

222
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,439
at school after school uh with some

223
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:01,638
weight and uh lost my career and I was

224
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,959
able to get into a drug court uh

225
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,639
scenario to fight my felony charges you

226
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,959
know because my addiction caused my

227
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,439
crime right um and was able to get

228
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,719
through that wasn't a felon thank god um

229
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,360
but I lost my career I didn't know what

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,919
I was going to do and I ended up writing

231
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,598
um on the side is more of a side hustle

232
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,000
I was Finding gigs doing freelance stuff

233
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,360
mostly sustainability education that

234
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,120
kind of stuff and then I got out of drug

235
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
court and the legal industry started

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,959
happening around the country and I

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,519
started finding G

238
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,319
in that and then a lot of right place

239
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,839
right time sort of stuff and now I'm

240
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,000
running a cannabis website owned by the

241
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,719
San Francisco Chronicle so it's been a

242
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,679
really interesting Evolution and I often

243
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,200
joke that if I hadn't gotten busted I

244
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,759
wouldn't be where I am today so yeah you

245
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,879
know I reflect on a lot of that stuff uh

246
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,679
as I'm getting older like stuff that

247
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,838
seems to be so bad in the moment

248
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,479
actually if you just breathe and you

249
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
just kind of move past it and you just

250
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,240
put one foot in front of the other uh uh

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,039
they can be life-changing things that

252
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,039
were meant to happen for a specific

253
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,360
reason right exactly it's really

254
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,078
interesting I do believe that everything

255
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,759
happens the way it's supposed to happen

256
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:13,639
Y and that the Universe puts you where

257
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,278
you need to be um and so yeah at the

258
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,838
time I was really pissed and you know

259
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,200
sad and whatever that this thing

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,680
happened to me but it worked out for the

261
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,040
best honestly at the end of the day

262
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,519
totally and you could be an equity

263
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,879
partner in Oakland yeah right

264
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,959
exactly so yeah so and then you go to a

265
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,600
lot of events so many events like all of

266
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,838
the events um and all of the events I

267
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,680
swear you go to all the events like I

268
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,760
used to go to a lot of events and then I

269
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,399
look on Instagram I I see you on

270
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:46,439
Instagram a lot and you're at all the

271
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,600
events like literally all the in in fact

272
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,040
I don't even know how you do it

273
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
sometimes how you got to spannabis and

274
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,319
you were in

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,000
California uh I can't remember the event

276
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,879
that you at like two days before span

277
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,519
Abus and then you jump over to Spain and

278
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,000
you're just you know jet setting yeah

279
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,720
it's a cool lifestyle it's exhausting

280
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,600
but it's really fun and I again never

281
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,879
thought that would happen and I've been

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,000
able to go all over the world um writing

283
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,240
about weed and meeting people and It's a

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,919
Grind for sure and people often laugh

285
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,278
they're like wow you know we don't

286
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,838
understand how you do it how you are

287
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,320
alive and breathing and putting out

288
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,880
articles like someone was commenting

289
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,680
about I was at mjbiz last year and I've

290
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,480
been going hard all week as one does and

291
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,519
it was literally Friday I'm in the Press

292
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
booth and it's a big glass kind of box

293
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,039
on the show floor and I'm writing an

294
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,278
article that I have to file immediately

295
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,759
and people are just like are you serious

296
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:37,480
right now how do you do it and I guess

297
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,039
I'm just blessed to have a brain that

298
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,879
can compartmentalize and function and

299
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,838
grind because I've always uh had that

300
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,399
kind of Scrappy Hustler sort of nature

301
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,200
even as a kid and so I guess I just keep

302
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,559
going I do break down once in a great

303
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,839
while where I'm like it's too much right

304
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,879
uh but for the most part I just put it

305
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,000
into perspective and think about what a

306
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,519
blessing it is to have this life and to

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,679
be able to tell the story and to share

308
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,000
this information with people who so

309
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,679
desperately need it because that's

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,879
actually my real passion James is the

311
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,879
ability to advocate for the plant and be

312
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,679
a steward of the plant and inform people

313
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,958
who may not even realize what this plant

314
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,879
could do for them or their families I

315
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:23,479
remember one of the very first events I

316
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:25,000
ever did I met a woman and she had a

317
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,600
daughter who was born with an incredibly

318
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,519
rare uh condition and she was only

319
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,360
supposed to have a life expectancy of

320
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,000
one-year-old and they started treating

321
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,720
her with CBD oil and she was four years

322
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,320
old at the time is this Hazel um Yes

323
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,839
actually yes um awesome story super

324
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,639
awesome and I was crying you know and I

325
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,200
couldn't believe it and sharing that

326
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,560
story you know meant so much to me and

327
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,278
it made me really realize that this was

328
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:56,919
what I was meant to do my dad had

329
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:59,399
epilepsy growing up and he was not

330
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,199
treatable and he went in for for a

331
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,679
surgery to get his brain corrected and

332
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,879
he had a massive stroke and was

333
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,120
paralyzed um never walked again he had

334
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,399
severe brain damage he was like a

335
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,039
nursing homes my whole life he passed

336
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,320
away in 2020 long-term complications

337
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:15,240
from his stroke knowing what we know now

338
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,959
about epilepsy and cannabis I have no

339
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,399
doubt that the plant could have maybe

340
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,599
saved his life and we never got the

341
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,399
chance to try it because we didn't know

342
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
any better now we do and that's why I

343
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,000
just keep advocating telling those

344
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,198
stories telling Hazel story everyone you

345
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,879
know yeah because people need to know

346
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,159
what this plant can do education exactly

347
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,399
and awareness I think education and

348
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,240
awareness are slightly different yeah

349
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,198
and I think people just need to be aware

350
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,360
because I feel like there's still this

351
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:42,519
stigma with the older generation that

352
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,639
cannabis is bad or cannabis is that you

353
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,198
know the flower is drugs and I think

354
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,639
even with this schedule three thing now

355
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:51,198
people are like well the stuff they're

356
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,919
smoking that's not that's not a that's

357
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,078
not a medical drug that's a that's a

358
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,000
drug people are using that just to get

359
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:00,479
high and that's not the case

360
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,078
unfortunately yeah I mean I think that's

361
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,120
a big part of it too and I will never

362
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,638
stop sharing and advocating for the

363
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,198
plant and people can do with the

364
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,278
information what they want to do with it

365
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:12,958
but they can at least have it I remember

366
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,360
when I first got into this I had an aunt

367
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,958
who was like you're obsessed with

368
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,800
marijuana your career is never going to

369
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,759
go anywhere like you know whatever

370
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,759
you're ashamed of the family and

371
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,360
literally two years later she's like hey

372
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,519
I have a friend who says she feels 20

373
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,120
years younger on this CBD oil you're in

374
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,679
that space aren't you can you can you

375
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,639
get me some and I was like sometimes

376
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,439
that's just what it takes it's a

377
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,079
personal connection or something to

378
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,680
click and that's why I just won't stop

379
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,838
yeah sanj Gupta wrote the 60-minute

380
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,638
article and that changed my parents

381
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,959
lives for as far as cannabis is

382
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,959
concerned and and CBD the second you can

383
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,799
put kids in front of people and go how

384
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,039
do you have a right to judge a parent

385
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,078
for giving a kid something that could

386
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,159
make their lives better judge a parent

387
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,239
or a kid you know and how could you take

388
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,958
that away from parents or it's just

389
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,759
we're in a silly time where people are

390
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,399
still like not getting it fully uh but

391
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,120
things are changing you know I mean even

392
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,679
with the schedule 3 is bad as it is it's

393
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,679
good in a lot of other ways I mean

394
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,479
there's there's the good and the bad

395
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,638
with it for sure yeah I think for a lot

396
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,720
of mainstream folks they see that and

397
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,839
the government for the first time is

398
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,160
admitting that there is medicinal

399
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,199
benefit to the plant and so if the

400
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,559
government can admit that I think that

401
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,078
will be a spark for a lot of people

402
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,319
those of us in the industry we kind of

403
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,000
know the nuances with rescheduling

404
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
versus Des scheduling and what we would

405
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,679
prefer but I think if that's what it

406
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,078
takes you have to meet people on their

407
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,120
level that's what it comes down to

408
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,838
really mhm yeah agreed yeah it's

409
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,000
interesting I mean our government had

410
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,560
patents on cannabis years and years and

411
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,720
years ago in the

412
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:49,879
70s so it's it's it's time that we make

413
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,519
change I think there's so many people

414
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,399
that are on board with it I mean there's

415
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,600
so many Advocates uh we just Lo lost a

416
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,958
good friend Dave damit rest in peace

417
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,000
we're gonna have his seeds available on

418
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,319
my website uh I'm germinating seeds

419
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,839
we're going to be doing some pheno

420
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
hunting with his genetics he has

421
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,279
something really special he's Blue 13 oh

422
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,958
wow and I don't know if you you've had

423
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:11,198
white Thorn Rose I would assume and you

424
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,278
know the way white Thorn Rose makes you

425
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,278
feel yeah the Blue 13 does the same

426
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,439
thing really it has the it so I I feel

427
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,838
like and I was talking to someone at his

428
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,040
memorial uh his what do they call it now

429
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,560
it's a celebration of life celebration

430
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,120
of life and you know we've changed it

431
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,879
but yeah and it was a celebration of

432
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,198
life it was amazing but I got to meet

433
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:35,360
one of his friends and she's a ganier

434
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,198
and she's probably the only person in

435
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,839
the whole world that's tried both of the

436
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,879
the Blue 13 and the white Thorn Rose and

437
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,800
we both looked at each other crazy when

438
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,639
we were like they have the same effect

439
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,479
wow right and then she kind of validated

440
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,120
the fact that I was thinking it and I'm

441
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,800
now I know I'm not crazy and she knows

442
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
she's not crazy and so now we're like

443
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,198
well we need to research this stuff so

444
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,480
we're going to be doing some tests on it

445
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:57,399
and they've already been doing tests on

446
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,399
the White thron Rose y so and it comes

447
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,039
down to a specific turp in it's very

448
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,078
unique and I can't think of the name of

449
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,679
it we'll post it on the podcast but uh

450
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,799
yeah really really cool and uh it just

451
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:12,198
makes you feel really special but Dave

452
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:14,519
he was a huge advocate he was a great

453
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,919
person he's gonna be missed you know I

454
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,799
think of him every day still I look at

455
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,759
his seeds and I'm like okay how can we

456
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,078
do justice to Dave with his seeds and do

457
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,039
something special for his family so

458
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:28,078
we're going to sell his seeds on my

459
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,838
website uh and raise money for his kids

460
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,159
and he his older kids but they're still

461
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,880
kids um yeah great kids that's so

462
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,439
beautiful that you can do that and use

463
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,078
the plant in the way that I'm sure he

464
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,040
would have wanted you know uh and keep

465
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:44,958
his legacy alive you know he was such a

466
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,078
great guy and I mentioned this I know we

467
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,039
did the tribute episode and you featured

468
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,399
my clip which I appreciate but yeah I

469
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,198
mean canacon was one of the very first

470
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,318
events I ever did and he put his hand

471
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:55,919
out to me and he encouraged me even on

472
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:57,919
social media he'd watch my journey and

473
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,519
he was always just so positive and

474
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,799
encouraging and I mean I really give him

475
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,318
a lot of credit for helping me to step

476
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,959
into this industry into this role that

477
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,558
I'm in and I can't wait to grow his

478
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,038
seeds and and to smoke that because it

479
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,720
sounds amazing yeah yeah it's special

480
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,038
and I want to share it with everybody

481
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,318
and I think he would have loved that he

482
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:18,279
would have loved to hear that he was

483
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:21,838
just such a genuine person yeah and yeah

484
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:23,678
I just I miss him a lot um it's funny

485
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,599
because you go through different phas

486
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,640
phases of grief when somebody passes

487
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,480
yeah and like I miss him more now for

488
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,960
what ever reason I feel it more like

489
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,919
when it first when you're processing the

490
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,120
whole thing it's difficult but then it's

491
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,160
like after he's gone it's it's it's just

492
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,000
grief is a weird thing it is and then it

493
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,960
triggers you in like unexpected sort of

494
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,119
ways right you know something will

495
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,558
remind you of him or something more

496
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,319
visceral like smoking a certain strain

497
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,879
right could like send you back to that

498
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,079
strain and so yeah it's just it's

499
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,720
interesting how that works I get that

500
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,279
with my dad all the time you know little

501
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
things that remind me of him and totally

502
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,879
I lost my dog last year that was a big

503
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
one it's been almost a year that that's

504
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,120
that was the toughest thing I had to go

505
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,918
through yeah no it's it's that's really

506
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,279
hard pets pets should live forever yeah

507
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,679
it's it's sad they should well I I

508
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,918
wouldn't want them to outlive me though

509
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,919
that's the thing so I feel like at least

510
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,759
I got to give my dog the life you know

511
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,840
the best life possible totally Yeah we

512
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,960
actually my fiance as you know uh grows

513
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,839
hemp and he actually makes CBD dog

514
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,159
treats yeah really cool yeah um the

515
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,480
doggy dreams and they help so many

516
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,200
animals and it's really really cool to

517
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,919
see actually just lost his dog Lucy um

518
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
she was a great great girl and it's been

519
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,080
really hard for him to continue with the

520
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,759
dog treats because he's so emotional

521
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,759
they remind him so much of Lucy and I'm

522
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,279
like man there's so many other animals

523
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,119
out there who could use this medicine

524
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,519
and we see how it works you know dogs

525
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,959
who have joint pain and epilepsy and all

526
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,279
these different things separation

527
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,480
anxiety is huge right and so I'm like we

528
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,918
have to keep going in her name yeah you

529
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,038
know no matter how hard it is there's a

530
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,120
lot of work to be done yeah for Dave for

531
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,519
the people that have passed I mean yeah

532
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:02,479
I mean breeder too there's so many so

533
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,000
many people that have passed yeah and I

534
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,519
think it's really cool what you do you

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,159
know and that you really want to keep

536
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,119
their memory alive through the plant and

537
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,559
through the genetics um I think that's a

538
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,359
really really unique way to honor

539
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,359
someone especially in this community I

540
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,479
think it's our responsibility totally

541
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,558
you know I think that's one of the

542
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,038
respon you know growing up you have lots

543
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,319
of responsibilities this is just another

544
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,798
one is being a steward to a plant and

545
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:26,918
being part of a community that's so much

546
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,839
bigger than yourself MH and that's what

547
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,440
I love about the plant yeah that's

548
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,319
Absolut I mean the plant brings us

549
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,960
together like we're here together

550
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,720
today uh that's the beauty of this plant

551
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,400
is like it can bring amazing people

552
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,839
together that wouldn't normally

553
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,798
associate with one another but this

554
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:46,798
plant is so special and it brings people

555
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:49,079
together for good reasons for

556
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,480
benefiting not only the community but

557
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,839
benefiting the planet and other people

558
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,720
yeah absolutely and I think that's one

559
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,678
of the things that I really like about

560
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,798
you James is that we're very similar in

561
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,519
that sort of way you know I don't see an

562
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,558
ounce of ego on you you understand that

563
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,279
this is bigger than us and I feel the

564
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,639
exact same way and I've always felt that

565
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:09,399
way um and just knowing what you want to

566
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,559
do for the people and the plant and like

567
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,080
your passion it's just so inspiring and

568
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:15,000
I've always just loved that energy about

569
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,439
you because I could always feel it you

570
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,359
know I don't know if you remember this

571
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,000
but uh there was that MJ Biz where we

572
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,399
were we were both at some party I think

573
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,200
it was maybe at the MGM and you remember

574
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,600
this the

575
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:33,240
uh I do so for those uh listening

576
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,079
basically we were sitting outside on

577
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,759
this patio and I was adjusting some

578
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,599
stuff in my bag and I pulled out my puff

579
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,079
Co I didn't even have it turned on and

580
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,839
the security guard who was standing

581
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,359
there saw it and bounced me from the

582
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:49,399
party like do not pass go do not collect

583
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,158
$200 like walked my ass right to the

584
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,360
elevator like we don't tolerate that in

585
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,080
here and I went downstairs I was by

586
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,359
myself I was like okay now what and then

587
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,720
you came down and you were like man

588
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,439
screw those guys like come hang out with

589
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,360
us for a while and we just went and had

590
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
a great time and it was BS it was such

591
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,319
BS but it was so nice of you to like

592
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
have my back and just be like no it's

593
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,119
cool like roll with us for a while like

594
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,640
we'll have some fun it'll be great and

595
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,439
it was it was really special and I was

596
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,679
like Wow James is such a nice guy he

597
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,200
looks out for me yeah I mean we're all

598
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,840
part of a group you know and we're part

599
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,720
of a special group part of the community

600
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,278
that you know I feel like there's

601
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,640
different clicks within the groups uh

602
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:26,200
and you know and some of them are egos I

603
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,278
used to have a lot more ego than I do

604
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,200
now and I think with age that changes

605
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:33,000
too yeah I suppose age and experience

606
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,278
yeah but also I mean I just like having

607
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,079
a good time and I like my friends to

608
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,200
have a good time and I just I think it's

609
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,639
just a lot of fun like living is a lot

610
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,919
of fun yeah it certainly can be and I

611
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,278
love that it's like it's really really

612
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,440
easy to get dragged down by everything

613
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,400
that's going on the stress just existing

614
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,798
in this world is hard it's it's really

615
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,559
hard but there are joyful moments too

616
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:55,119
and it's a blessing to have this life

617
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:56,720
and we should be celebrating it and

618
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,119
living life to its fullest because not

619
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,558
everyone has that opportunity I think

620
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,439
about that with my dad all the time it's

621
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,798
like he was in a wheelchair for the last

622
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,120
third of his life you know and being

623
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:06,240
able to go out and take him to like

624
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,918
concerts or something where he could

625
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,558
just feel free for like a couple hours

626
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,278
was just so he still had blessings he

627
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:13,558
still had amazing things going on in his

628
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:16,119
life even though I mean we all do and

629
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,399
and you know it's like you gota you know

630
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,558
I reflect a lot on on everything that's

631
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,640
going on uh you know I meditate and I

632
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:26,960
reflect and I think about what's going

633
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,159
on and what went on and you know it's

634
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
really interesting we just got to count

635
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,679
our blessing because you never know how

636
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,600
long you have uh and all you really have

637
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,120
is the moment you have right now and

638
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,399
there's so much to be grateful for

639
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,519
totally you know trying to live in

640
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,080
gratitude is just it's difficult to do

641
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,879
and trying to live in the moment it's

642
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,199
it's easy to talk about but it's really

643
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,520
difficult to do yeah it is and it's

644
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,880
interesting that you bring that up like

645
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,798
I've studied Buddhism quite a bit and it

646
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,840
just makes so much sense in a practical

647
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:59,278
sort of manner and I was at a Dharma

648
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,678
talk one time uh maybe 10 15 years ago

649
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,079
and when I was younger I was a lot more

650
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,559
not aggressive but angry right I had a

651
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,359
lot of pain in my heart and I had a

652
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,720
really hard childhood and I was

653
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,439
resentful right I had a chip on my

654
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,200
shoulder and I was listening to the

655
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,720
gentleman do the Dharma talk and he was

656
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,480
talking about when you wake up in the

657
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,880
morning and you go out and you face the

658
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,360
world what emotion are you leading with

659
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,480
yeah you know is it sadness is it Joy is

660
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:27,359
it and I was like wow I've been facing

661
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,079
the rule of anger my entire life and

662
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,479
that changes right now and I decided to

663
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,199
just switch it up and have an attitude

664
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,679
of gratitude and all of a sudden my

665
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,919
whole world changed and it was a really

666
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,679
beautiful thing it sounds like that was

667
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,720
maybe your experience a little bit too

668
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,000
for sure I think you know and we go

669
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,960
through trauma everybody you know we go

670
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,798
through you know we go through so much

671
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,600
growing up and from childhood and

672
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,720
becoming an adult much different than it

673
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,599
is

674
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,440
today I guess it's not all that

675
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,839
different it's still it's it's changed

676
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,000
but it's not all that different it's

677
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,678
difficult no matter how you look at it

678
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,159
whether it's today whether it's our

679
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,000
generation our parents generation it's

680
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,200
all a difficult thing uh you know and

681
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,720
there are you know we all experience

682
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,679
trauma in one form or another Y and so

683
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,278
moving beyond the trauma and being able

684
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,880
to recognize that it's trauma and not

685
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,798
letting it affect you negatively that's

686
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,919
something that uh you know it's not easy

687
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:24,759
to do and I'm I'm grateful that I can do

688
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,038
that and I can look at the world from a

689
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:28,960
different perspective totally what are

690
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,038

cold plunging yeah it makes me relax and

703
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,480
makes me feel grateful for everything

704
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,119

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,880
little things though but those are the

714
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,519
big things it's like the little things

715

725
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,600
to change the way I am and change the

726
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,120
you know and those things I can reflect

727
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,959
on and be super grateful yeah but uh you

728
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,759

lot of good food I'm a big guy I love

731
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,240
food I I love

732
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,599
not just the food and the way it tastes

733
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,399
and the the differences with texture and

734
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,839
the sweet and the sour and the Savory

735
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,918
and the different flavors just like

736
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,439
cannabis with the with the flavors but I

737
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,840
love the social aspect of food and going

738
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,480
out with my friends and hanging out and

739
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,959
having a good time and knowing that that

740
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,399
experience is only going to happen once

741
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,640
and we might have another experience

742
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,158
together but it's not going to be that

743
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,240
same experience yeah and that's really

744
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,120
really special and it's really cool that

745
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,640
you recognize that you know every single

746
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,038
meal and every time you can break bread

747
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,759
with your friends and family it's a

748
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,599
blessing for sure and yeah I definitely

749
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,200
see a lot of great food on your on your

750
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,759
page I'm like oh I don't know where he

751
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,200
is but I want some of that yeah I eat a

752
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:44,398
lot of good food and I cook a lot of

753
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,080
good food now I'm like focused on I'm

754
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:48,798
gonna for the for the next couple months

755
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,199
I'm really focusing on this facility but

756
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,278
also cooking right and so we have a

757
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
kitchen here we're going to have the

758
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,000
outdoor kitchen but so I'll be cooking

759
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,719
for people here it'll be nice but also

760
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,960
for myself and I enjoy cooking I don't

761
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,679
enjoy doing it for a living as much

762
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,960
happy that I don't have to do that in

763
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,720
some ways but there is some you know

764
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,798
there is something special about making

765
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,679
food and then giving it to somebody and

766
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,278
they're like wow that's amazing yeah

767
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,120
that's that must be really special and

768
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,480
unique like I'm curious though it's the

769
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,398
same thing with weed though when you're

770
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,240
like this is my [ __ ] and then they you

771
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,199
give it to them and they're like whoa

772
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,480
this is freaking phenomenal or oh dude

773
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
this sucks yeah I don't I don't get that

774
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,720
very much with either one I assume I

775
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,839
would assume not yeah but but yeah I

776
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,440
mean I think just the reaction but at

777
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,158
the same time you you know it's like

778
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,519
other people have opinions on stuff and

779
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,679
you at the end of the day know what

780
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,240
you've done and you know you can't worry

781
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,720
about other people's opinions too much

782
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,278
either and you know you the thing is is

783
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,079
like if you're just trying to please

784
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:53,398
other people that's not a great way to

785
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,000
live either you really need to please

786
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:56,959
yourself and I think that's the most

787
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,159
important thing is figuring out how to

788
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,558
make yourself happy and that's the only

789
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,919
way you can really make other people

790
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,079
happy totally I would agree with that

791
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,278
and that's something that I've actually

792
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,720
been working really hard on because I'm

793
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,839
such a huge people pleaser yeah that

794
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,278
like it's difficult because especially

795
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,798
in journalism it's like oh well I want

796
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,480
to you know do write by my friends I

797
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,960
want to amplify them I want them to like

798
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,880
this piece I want to do whatever I can

799
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,840
for them but it's like you can't play

800
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,440
favorites either you know and you can't

801
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,678
just do stuff to do stuff there's

802
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,200
journalism ethics right and so that's a

803
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,240
fine line for me and not overextending

804
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,720
myself to and over promising because

805
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,399
sometimes I get in my head I get anxious

806
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,839
like oh wait like do they actually want

807
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:36,439
to hang out and talk to me or do they

808
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,959
just want me to write about them and I

809
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,038
have that weird internal dialogue

810
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,120
sometimes and I'm like no it's cool like

811
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:43,879
you're you're a good person tot don't

812
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,199
sweat it yeah and there's a lot of good

813
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,399
people in our industry you know I think

814
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,278
some are mostly good yeah I would I

815
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,119
would say mostly yeah for sure there's

816
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,038
definitely more good than bad honest

817
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,639
like and when you surround yourself and

818
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:58,879
you with good people and you get what

819
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
you put out in the universe mhm right

820
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,720
and I feel like you must really

821
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,119
recognize that as well because you

822
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,519
emanate such joy and such passion so I

823
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,798
bet you get a lot of that back for sure

824
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,200
and you know whatever you put into

825
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,759
something you get out of it too so like

826
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,120
relationships are the same way totally

827
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,119
yeah yeah and so what's your favorite

828
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,439
strain right now as far as I get we're

829
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,278
calling it strain on the show guys

830
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,320
because uh that's just what most people

831
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:26,000
call it correct or incorrect cultivar

832
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:28,798
whatever you want to call Variety it's

833
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,679
okay strand call

834
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,119
see know that's the one that drives me

835
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,320
nuts is strand when I hear people say

836
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,599
strand I kind of cringe wonder strin I

837
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:41,798
just it's so commonly accepted yeah uh

838
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:43,240
even though it's incorrect yeah cultivar

839
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,639
this

840
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,519
cross are correct I've been saying

841
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,720
variety a lot lately but anyways to your

842
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:53,679
question it's a tough one I've actually

843
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,278
been smoking a lot more High CBD strains

844
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,480
yeah lately which has been awesome H the

845
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:01,359
sapphire Sue from moonmaid Farm is

846
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,679
awesome um my fiance grew this sour jet

847
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,240
fuel High CBD strain which has been

848
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,798
great um I also have been really

849
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,000
enjoying um this goua from snow till I

850
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,639
have not tried that but you're the

851
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,519
second person that told me about it so

852
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,080
really yeah yeah it's I don't know it's

853
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,159
just it's very cerebral it's very mellow

854
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,079
uh we also grew a bunch of super high

855
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,039
life from ated Rosenthal and Humbolt

856
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:29,079
Seed Company um and that's been really

857
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:31,398
great I've also been enjoying the um uh

858
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,879
snow Dream from a golden state that

859
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,439
one's really good but yeah the sapphire

860
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,840
Sue I just keep going back to that

861
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,919
because I can actually smoke it all

862
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,798
throughout the day and it's not overly

863
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,120
heady like the CBD is very balancing and

864
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,398
I have to give a big shout out to the

865
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,959
CBD strains and the minor cannaboids I

866
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:50,079
feel like they don't get enough respect

867
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,240
in the market especially with everyone's

868
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,678
emphasis on high THC we both know that

869
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,359
that's BS but I mean that's you know

870
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,880
it's like oh if it's not 30 plus% 40%

871
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,359
it's like [ __ ] and it's like no like

872
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,639
there's a lot of really really good hemp

873
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,959
and or just High CBD strains and I'm

874
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:08,678
actually judging the alternative

875
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,038
cannaboids category for Emerald cup

876
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,759
awesome and I specifically was like

877
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,599
please let me judge this category

878
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:17,398
because I want to amplify the power of

879
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,439
these minor cannaboids and show that

880
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:20,518
there can be some fire CBD out there

881
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,200
because I don't think it gets enough

882
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,278
respect in the market there some super

883
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,798
amazing stuff yeah we're going to be

884
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:28,960
doing some amazing stuff here like

885
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,879
that's just I mean that's one of my big

886
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,159
breeding goals is to bring a lot more

887
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,360
flavor into the high CBD varieties the

888
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,080
high ratio CBD varieties and some of the

889
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,079
CBG I think is super important I think

890
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,359
CVG medically is super important I love

891
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,879
CBG the

892
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,119
effects um I feel like it's special yeah

893
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,080
so and a lot of people have never even

894
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,518
experienced it they don't get it no they

895
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,038
don't and it's really popular um in

896
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,440
other states you know California is such

897
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,200
a bubble right but in other states where

898
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,679
they've kind of been forced into the

899
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,960
minor cannaboids if they can't get high

900
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:03,399
THC products and they're just

901
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,679
experimenting with other ones I think

902
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:07,239
that's been really really interesting to

903
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,278
see how in more prohibition States some

904
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,720
of these minor cannaboids are more

905
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,480
popular um what about the thcv have you

906
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,440
been trying that out at all I've tried

907
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,639
it over the years I haven't found a thcv

908
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,519
product that I really liked I love the

909
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:25,398
data and I love the concept of it I love

910
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,079
the theory of thcv I think it's like you

911
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:30,558
know interesting and I think it has a

912
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,079
lot of potential you know as a diet drug

913
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:35,599
and all these other things and the ones

914
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:39,240
I got it just didn't give me a great

915
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:41,278
great High okay in my experience nothing

916
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,399
that I would say was super special I

917
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,319
didn't feel super wiry from it like some

918
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,319
people

919
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:52,798
get um what's your opinion I have been

920
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:54,918
enjoying the thcv uh Kurt my fiance had

921
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,119
grown some double Durban uh which was

922
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,679
really good and I tried some from I

923
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,879
can't remember the name of it now but

924
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,440
when I was judging the women's K Awards

925
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,360
there was a high thcv strain from some

926
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,480
Sacramento producer that was good but I

927
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:13,839
also tried a a thcv dab at a party I

928
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,639
think it was Garden Society I think

929
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,599
because they do their thcv gummy and I

930
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:21,240
think they were r&amp; ding uh some oil yeah

931
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,398
and so I tried that at a party and

932
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,960
lately dabs and I like do not really get

933
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,359
along I can't really do a hot dab

934
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,360
anymore I just get too anxious but I did

935
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,798
the th CV dab and I was focused I was

936
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,839
clear I was talking to everybody at the

937
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,240
party no paranoia and I was like huh

938
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,000
maybe this is something for me yeah I I

939
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,480
think with those type of things it's all

940
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,440
about the

941
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,480
right product yeah and I haven't had

942
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,360
enough to say it's bad or it's because

943
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,480
it s like everything I've read about it

944
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,918
and everything I've heard about it is

945
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,079
it's amazing and I just haven't I've had

946
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:57,399
some CBD or not CBD thcv dabs that are

947
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,398
pure thcv and maybe it needs to be full

948
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:00,038
spec

949
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,239
right that's the other thing where it's

950
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,919
like mostly thcv just like how I like

951
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,878
CBG or I like CBG with

952
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,599
THC um same thing CBD I like them

953
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,679
Blended I think they they work really

954
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,720
well together yeah same I love a little

955
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:18,119
salad moment have you tried the uh the

956
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,480

962
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,440
fact that they've gone and work they're

963
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,760

doing the right thing yeah the emerald

965
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,079
Spirit shout out to those guys they're

really crushing it and I really like the

967
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,039
farm cut too I think that's cool I know

968
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:45,878
that some people are like oh why would

969
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,719
you buy larhe weed but I like the idea

970
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:50,239
of like it kind of remaining intact like

971
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,398
for more Tarpin what do you think about

972
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,078
the farm

973
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:57,078
cut it's it's an interesting one um you

974
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,240
know so it's funny cuz Huckleberry Hill

975
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,920
Farms

976
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,559
gave me jars of their uh of their white

977
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,880
Thorn Rose and I love white Thorn Rose

978
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,239
yeah but I try to share it with some of

979
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,960
my friends and they're like dude this is

980
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,479
boof and I'm like dude you don't even

981
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,679
smoke they're like bro they give me the

982
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,400
bro and it's like dude you you know it's

983
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,239
it's funny because you know we talked on

984
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,880
my last podcast about how Instagram is

985
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,519
kind of ruined weed and that's the

986
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,519
perfect example it's like this the stuff

987
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,280
is amazing and and it's also subjective

988
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:29,239
because what amazing is is subjective to

989
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,280
the individual yeah but but that flower

990
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:34,358
is super special and is super good and

991
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,920
it does look like it's okay you know

992
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:38,639
it's outdoor and I I still like Outdoors

993
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,680
so I I don't mind and I like ugly weed

994
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:45,118
too so same I think about that with the

995
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:47,118
Canon country 26 yeah you know like it's

996
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,599
a little stemi it's you know it's very

997
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,119
very dark um it tests slow but that's

998
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,160
some very very special cannabis and it

999
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,480
gets you laid out for being 177% cuz

1000
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:02,318
that aamine turp is so wild and and I

1001
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,639
agree with you 100% that the market has

1002
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:05,880
shifted in a in a not great way and

1003
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,318
people don't even know what good

1004
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,400
cannabis is I write about it all the

1005
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:12,358
time it's like I really want to know

1006
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,599
more about the consumer's psyche and how

1007
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:15,920
they decided that weed was good or bad

1008
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:17,838
and I always judge it when I'm at a

1009
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,159
thing like Hall of flowers or whatever

1010
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:23,199
and I see a package to me it's like the

1011
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:24,799
crazier and brighter the packages the

1012
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,598
worse the weed's going to be inside and

1013
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,560
then the most basic package or like the

1014
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,240
backpack weed and the ziplock like you

1015
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,880
know that's going to be fire the Mason

1016
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,959
jar the ziplock yeah yeah totally and

1017
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,720
yeah know ugly weed has its place

1018
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,318
totally yeah and someday when we have a

1019
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,639
pre-roll brim that's just focused on

1020
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:43,759
pre-rolls and you don't get to see the

1021
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,559
weed people are going to love it you

1022
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,200
know and I think when you can take away

1023
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,799
that aspect of it and that's why rosin's

1024
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,118
so great too because rosin really it's

1025
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,839
like it's either good rosin or it's bad

1026
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,680
rosin you're not looking I mean yeah

1027
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,318
people look at the actually that's not

1028
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,239
true people look at the Ros and they're

1029
00:36:56,318 --> 00:36:59,960
like oh it's not the right Tech this or

1030
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,239
that the color's off the color's off

1031
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,199
it's not light enough yeah but really at

1032
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,118
the it's about the taste and the effect

1033
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,679
totally right and at the end of the day

1034
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,039
you know obviously we eat with our eyes

1035
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:13,318
the phone eats first when we're you know

1036
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,279
totally I say that all the time dude

1037
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:18,000
it's so funny but like at the end of the

1038
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,200
day it's all about flavor and effect

1039
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,760
yeah that's how it should be yeah I

1040
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,399
would agree I mean judging cannabis has

1041
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,000
been very interesting when you're

1042
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,559
looking at the appearance and and what

1043
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,559
exactly are the the metrics like oh how

1044
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,799
many of the tricomes are intact what's

1045
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,159
the color right how's the trim job right

1046
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,800
you know how can we rate cannabis on a

1047
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:40,399
really objective scale to me the effect

1048
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,760
is difficult because that's subjective

1049
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,160
um you know something that feels really

1050
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,240
great for me like that thcv dab maybe

1051
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,598
wouldn't work out well for you so how do

1052
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,279
you think we need to evolve as an

1053
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,119
industry to be able to set those

1054
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,160
standards like they maybe do in other

1055
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,280
Industries like wine or whatever and

1056
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,639
it's all about consumer trust and time

1057
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,920
yeah I think uh you you build your

1058
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,239
consumer trust from having good products

1059
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,240
and you know people try them time you

1060
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,639
know you you you have someone try the or

1061
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,799
buy the product three times they're a

1062
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,239
customer for life at least that's what

1063
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,079
they say and so we're finding out that

1064
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,199
with the seed sales over the last year

1065
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,920
our website's been live for since

1066
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,519
January of last year and the ones that

1067
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,240
have bought over three are the ones that

1068
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,679
keep buying for sure and so if you can

1069
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:25,519
get them to try your product they like

1070
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,000
it three times you're good to go and so

1071
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,519
really getting people to try your

1072
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,440
product again one time might not do it

1073
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,599
two times might not do it but that third

1074
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,440
time you're you're good and so exposure

1075
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,599
getting your brand out there but also

1076
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,318
having a consistent product which is I

1077
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,519
it's a lot more difficult to do than

1078
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:46,599
people think and the dispensary model

1079
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,079
that we have right now I mean the the

1080
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:51,160
infrastructure and the way we have it

1081
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,440
set up isn't designed to store products

1082
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:54,799
long term and so that needs to be fixed

1083
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,679
we need Refrigeration we need

1084
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,880
Refrigeration of the dispensaries we

1085
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,799
need or not even not full Refrigeration

1086
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,519
but we need to have cooler temps that

1087
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,400
we're storing our flour at and people

1088
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,199
don't get that and so you may have an

1089
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,559
awesome product and it may go to a

1090
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,919
dispensary and sit on the shelf for six

1091
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,639
months and somebody buys it and it's in

1092
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,159
La where it's hot or it's in the valley

1093
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,559
even worse so the store gets 100 degrees

1094
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,838
on some days your product's not going to

1095
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:23,559
be good after two weeks we need to fix

1096
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:25,559
those things we need to have all of the

1097
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,719
all of the delivery vehicles should be

1098
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,960
refrigerated all of the dispens should

1099
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,399
have some form of cooler temp that

1100
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,720
they're storing stuff in you know and

1101
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,079
this is just my opinion but I feel like

1102
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,480
the fresher you can get the product the

1103
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,760
better but if you can't get it fresh you

1104
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,960
better have good

1105
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,920
storage right that's I think that's been

1106
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,720
a big challenge in the marketplace and

1107
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,440
that's why companies like Grove bags and

1108
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,759
Bova are game changers yeah literally

1109
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,599
it's like I love my Grove bags I love my

1110
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,839
tur blocks and the thing is is like I

1111
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,359
have so many friends that were just like

1112
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,960
me that are like yeah right or I don't

1113
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,960
believe it I even had somebody here the

1114
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,119
other day that was like basically

1115
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,280
calling BS and then he did the research

1116
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,358
and he texted me this long text and was

1117
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,800
like actually I take back everything I

1118
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,400
said make sure you don't tell anybody I

1119
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,880
said that and the thing is is the proof

1120
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,039
isn't the pudding with this stuff it's

1121
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:20,519
like um I've been against the cryocure

1122
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,960
model yet I believe there is potential

1123
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,000
for it K from triome technology is one

1124
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,639
of my good friends uh he wrote an

1125
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,318
article on it and he's done I think he

1126
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,639
might even have a p P for it but I think

1127
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,400
there's really big potential for it I

1128
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,598
just haven't seen anything that's not

1129
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,200
astronaut ice cream we got a some guys

1130
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,160
coming on the show in a few episodes

1131
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,838
from now and we're going to be doing

1132
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:44,598
that their cryo here and we're going to

1133
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:47,000
be testing it with flower harvested from

1134
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:49,000
facilities and we're going to do the

1135
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,519
smoke test and we're going to do the COA

1136
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,880
test and so I've heard you know you hear

1137
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:57,519
all the good stuff and on paper it's

1138
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,280
like higher uh canabo higher tpin

1139
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:05,119
and so does that translate to a better

1140
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,960
smoke maybe maybe not so far no but I'm

1141
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,920
I I try to keep an open mind with

1142
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,440
everything because it's like technology

1143
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,599
evolves so fast the second you say

1144
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,920
no you get corrected a couple years down

1145
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:18,039
the road because they figure it out like

1146
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
we're we're smart people are smart

1147
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,440
there's a lot of science involved with

1148
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,519
this stuff there's a lot of people that

1149
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,079
are using and and there's there's so

1150
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:29,039
many people working on it now and with

1151
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,720
the D scheduling or rescheduling

1152
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,480
sorry uh we're going to have even more

1153
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:34,959
people and more scientists working on

1154
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,920
stuff so trying to figure out how to do

1155
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,838
stuff

1156
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,358
better uh I'm excited for the future I'm

1157
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,599
always excited for everything but for

1158
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:44,920
the future I'm super excited to see what

1159
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,400
happens with the plan I think there's a

1160
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,400
lot of people that are scared about

1161
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,440
what's going to

1162
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,240
happen but I'm excited to be honest as

1163
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,760
you should be and I am too I'm excited

1164
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,759
for what we don't know that we don't

1165
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,720
know right and what we what we are going

1166
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,800
to discover and I think it's really cool

1167
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,759
that you are willing to see how the cryo

1168
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,560
here works out even if you're uncertain

1169
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,319
about it even if you're mildly skeptical

1170
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,719
you have an open mind it's more than

1171
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:16,079
mild it's more than mild I just don't

1172
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,039
believe it but that doesn't mean that

1173
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,680
I'm right and I'm I'm one of those

1174
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,558
people who I'm okay with being wrong I'm

1175
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,598
okay with making mistakes you run a

1176
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,000
business and you you fail enough you you

1177
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,760
start being okay with that stuff and

1178
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,358
then learning how to do it the right way

1179
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,800
but I know that my way isn't always the

1180
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:32,440
right way so and I think that's cool

1181
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,640
because I feel like a lot of Growers and

1182
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,679
breeders are always like the best grower

1183
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,078
or breeder in the room right and it's

1184
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,118
their way or the highway and so I think

1185
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,119
it's really cool to hear that you are

1186
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:42,800
willing to make mistakes and you're

1187
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,640
willing to be wrong and and just have an

1188
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,119
open mind I think it's really important

1189
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,358
yeah I think that's a great way to live

1190
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,240
you know just go through life uh with

1191
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,719
less of an ego but like same thing with

1192
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:54,159
the breeding book it's like I I have a

1193
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,598
great breeding book it's the only

1194
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,679
breeding book out that's current and I

1195
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,400
don't think

1196
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:03,239
it's the it has the potential to be even

1197
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,280
better and I feel like there's other

1198
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,318
people that could have probably wrote a

1199
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,720
better book I think there's better

1200
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,199
breeders than me I think there's smarter

1201
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,239
people in the industry than me but I try

1202
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:13,598
to learn from them and I try to improve

1203
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,598
myself and I feel like that's all you

1204
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,160
can do at the end of the day you know

1205
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,440
you're never going to be the smartest

1206
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:20,318
you're never going to be the fastest

1207
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,318
you're never going to be the best

1208
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:23,599
there's so many people we're talking

1209
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:25,239
about s billion people on this planet so

1210
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,519
the best thing you can do is learn from

1211
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:30,879
other people and do what you feel that

1212
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,639
you were meant to do on this Earth yeah

1213
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,358
absolutely I think human beings struggle

1214
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,879
with that I think it's hard because I

1215
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,440
feel like let's say that you were wrong

1216
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,400
about something it's almost like you

1217
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,440
take it so personally like oh I'm less

1218
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,639
than but it's not it's just a learning

1219
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,280
experience to your point and I try to

1220
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,719
approach my writing with that all the

1221
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,920
time it's like please comment please let

1222
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,719
me know please let me know if there's

1223
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,720
anything I can do better or if there was

1224
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:57,639
a theory that I put in here that might

1225
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:58,919
be incorrect or that I could

1226
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:00,639
thought about it a different way I

1227
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,920
always invite that sort of feedback we

1228
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,759
can't take it personal yeah and I I care

1229
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,800
less and less about what people think

1230
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:11,240
and say about me the older I get yeah

1231
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,440
and so I you know it's just it is what

1232
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:15,558
it is you know your truth I know my

1233
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,280
truth and I know who I am and like the

1234
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,559
more you know who you are the easier

1235
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,000
that is too totally I would agree with

1236
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,760
that and that's definitely something

1237
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,239
that I've been I've been growing with

1238
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,359
you know and that's it's difficult

1239
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:28,558
sometimes because especially being so

1240
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,199
public facing and I know that you know

1241
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,000
what this is like there's a lot of eyes

1242
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,919
on you yeah and to go back to what we

1243
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,199
were saying earlier it's a lot of

1244
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,599
pressure but as long as you know deep

1245
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,838
down inside what your mission is and

1246
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,160
what where your heart is that's all that

1247
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:41,000
really matters people are going to think

1248
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:42,159
what they want to think they're going to

1249
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,719
say what they want to say but you know

1250
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,440
the truth and that's really all that you

1251
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,719
can control and what matters so yeah

1252
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,280
it's an interesting World we're living

1253
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,078
in and uh so where do you think it's

1254
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,519
going oh man that's a loaded question

1255
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,920
it's absolutely a loaded question well

1256
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:57,639
if we're talking about just the Cannabis

1257
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,680
world yeah it's it's a really

1258
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:01,519
interesting time right and there's a lot

1259
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,440
of uncertainty because not only do we

1260
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,440
have the rescheduling potentially

1261
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,119
happening but then we have the farm bill

1262
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,519
coming up and initially they weren't

1263
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,119
really talking about any of the

1264
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,679
intoxicating cannaboids any of the thca

1265
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,039
sort of stuff and then all of a sudden

1266
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:17,318
this amendment came through in committee

1267
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:20,480
and it could turn the hemp world upside

1268
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:22,719
down it totally could like if if they if

1269
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,480
they go by with what it says in that

1270
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,000
Amendment that's crazy because it it's

1271
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,480
going to screw the whole hemp in

1272
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
industry because what they're saying is

1273
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,400
that

1274
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,480
thca uh is basically the same thing as

1275
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,639
Delta 9 is what they're saying yeah but

1276
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,519
that's not right that's not true thca

1277
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:43,159
and it does so easily convert that's

1278
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,920
true you heat it up it converts to Delta

1279
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:49,598
KN but by itself um it be like I eat THC

1280
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,480
I can eat a gram of thca and it doesn't

1281
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,400
get me high at all yeah it actually

1282
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,519
makes me feel amazing but it doesn't get

1283
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,599
me high there's no

1284
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:01,639
psychoactive effect to thca by itself so

1285
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,440
it's it could totally yeah you're right

1286
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,639
it could totally turn

1287
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,039
the hemp industry upside down we'll see

1288
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,960
what happens I mean I think if they

1289
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,639
apply it to edibles but the whole thing

1290
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,800
where it's like I I don't know how to

1291
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,118
control it I I don't know how they're

1292
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,400
going to re write it to where like the

1293
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,760
stuff isn't legal they legalized it on

1294
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,838
accident right and then but to correct

1295
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,960
it to where it doesn't have a negative

1296
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,679
impact is going to be really difficult

1297
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,599
are they not going to allow CBD in shops

1298
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:30,199
you you know I mean I don't think so I

1299
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,838
don't think I think it's too big of a

1300
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:34,318
movement to slow down but I think

1301
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:37,519
they're going to try to figure out how

1302
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:40,318
to control all the sales of this stuff

1303
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:42,358
that's taking away money from Cannabis

1304
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,960
businesses in in States like California

1305
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:49,279
and New York and states that are

1306
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,639
impacted by the whole hemp loophole yeah

1307
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,359
it's it's been really interesting just

1308
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:55,920
to see how it's become sort of a hemp

1309
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:57,558
versus cannabis situation and we saw it

1310
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,240
in Minnesota when they were trying to

1311
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,040
pass their legalization bill because the

1312
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,118
hemp products were popping and they

1313
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:05,358
still are the the Delta 9 drinks and

1314
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,280
gummies you know you could buy them at

1315
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,759
the liquor store and get them at the tap

1316
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,640
room where everyone is right and people

1317
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,079
in the hemp space were anxious right

1318
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:15,199
because they were worried that if we had

1319
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,119
dispensaries that their business would

1320
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,199
suffer and it's vice versa right and so

1321
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,680
it's interesting to see how it's

1322
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:22,480
lobbyists for big cannabis groups coming

1323
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:24,960
out you know in support of this hemp

1324
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,960
Amendment and the the infighting when at

1325
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,480
the end of the day like I thought we

1326
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,280
were all on the same team

1327
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,079
you know and so it's been kind of

1328
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,680
disappointing to see the contentious

1329
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,280
nature I totally understand it from a

1330
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:36,759
business perspective right but I just

1331
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,040
wonder if there's any sort of way to

1332
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,280
level the playing field and just let the

1333
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:43,759
consumers decide yeah I don't know yeah

1334
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,040
we're gonna find out we are we're gonna

1335
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,640
find out this year probably yeah I think

1336
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,358
so well I mean a lot of people don't

1337
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:51,118
even know if the farm build will pass

1338
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:53,119
you know because cannabis and hemp is

1339
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,280
such a small small part of it there's a

1340
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,880
lot of other stuff up for debate in an

1341
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,800
election year and such a contentious

1342
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,400
time in Washington it's like who even

1343
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,519
knows if the bill will pass yeah so it's

1344
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,480
hard to say and then you have the

1345
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:07,800
rescheduling thing how will that play

1346
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,679
out in my opinion I feel it'll be more

1347
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,119
like business as usual I don't really

1348
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,960
feel like it's going to affect the

1349
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,920
day-to-day operations I feel like if

1350
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,318
they can get rid of 28e and there's more

1351
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:20,480
cash flow that's fantastic I would

1352
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:23,039
obviously rather see it descheduled um

1353
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,480
but I just I don't know if it's going to

1354
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,759
have this wild impact that some people

1355
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,719
theorize it will have well and the thing

1356
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,040
is is it's as of right now it is not

1357
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,959
deschedule right it is a pathway yes

1358
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:37,480
deschedule and so it's very different

1359
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,358
and if people are like oh it's done it's

1360
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,920
not done no there's a lot of stuff that

1361
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:45,358
has to happen for it to even make sense

1362
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,119
so we'll see I mean we taxing the

1363
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,719
taxation of it yeah how is it going to

1364
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,838
be taxed I mean I think there's so many

1365
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:54,919
aspects that need to be dis thoroughly

1366
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:56,400
discussed thoroughly thought through um

1367
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,039
and I believe now is the time where you

1368
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,720
can send uh a letter to your

1369
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:06,199
government if you uh want to comment on

1370
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,798
uh the whole process so yeah people

1371
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:09,879
should have their voices heard if they

1372
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:12,159
want to take take part in the Democratic

1373
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,119
process right I was actually uh covering

1374
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,358
Croots Festival done in Monteray last

1375
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,559
weekend looked awesome it was a Vibe it

1376
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:20,000
was profit BR they were there Luke

1377
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,798
scarmazzo he's been on the show he's

1378
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,679
amazing yeah we were actually sharing a

1379
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:25,039
booth with the equity Trade Network so

1380
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,440
we were hanging out he actually helped

1381
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:30,558
us judge a uh I did a Gyver bong contest

1382
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,200
I saw that I saw the Winner's bong too

1383
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,798
that was pretty cool yeah his little

1384
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,399
apple filter yeah he crushed it um and

1385
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:38,679
you know Luke like you know I know a

1386
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,280
thing or two about DIY pipes being in

1387
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:43,598
prison for 15 years but um I was talking

1388
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,240
to a lot of consumers there you know

1389
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,359
about the rescheduling because we exist

1390
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,838
in such a vacuum in cannabis right I'm

1391
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:53,199
always so curious about what consumers

1392
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:54,838
think and what their understanding of

1393
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,798
everything is most of them don't even

1394
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:58,199
really know what's happening and the one

1395
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:00,159
who do are definitely confused they

1396
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:01,679
think it's already a done deal they

1397
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,279
think that it's just less restrictive

1398
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,159
they think maybe it's legal but the

1399
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,960
consumers really have no idea about

1400
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,759
what's going on behind the curtain and

1401
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,400
what the implications are and a lot of

1402
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,119
in a lot of ways we don't either and I

1403
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,280
think that's really interesting because

1404
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,920
the consumers are the one that are

1405
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,720
driving this industry and they need to

1406
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,280
be aware of what's happening so they can

1407
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:21,039
have their voices heard and make an

1408
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,760
impact but I think at this point they're

1409
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,719
just like well weed's weed and I'm just

1410
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,440
going to follow along with whatever I've

1411
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,798
been doing right all the Sheep

1412
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,000
for real but yeah I mean there's a lot

1413
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:32,639
of people that they they don't want to

1414
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,079
know they don't care yeah they have so

1415
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,039
many more important things in their life

1416
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,720
or it just doesn't impact them at all y

1417
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:39,199
because they're not real smokers if you

1418
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:40,679
even if they smoke every once in a while

1419
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,000
it doesn't really impact their lives

1420
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,199
like there's so many people that are

1421
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,760
just uninformed but that's what

1422
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,000
awareness is all about yeah and that's

1423
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,920
what I think you know I'm trying to

1424
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,760
accomplish in my career is just to

1425
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,159
inform the people whenever I get down I

1426
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,640
try to remember my mission and my

1427
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,679
assignment you know remember the

1428
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:01,400
assignment which is to get the

1429
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,798
information about the plant to the

1430
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,599
people that's it that's the assignment

1431
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:08,119
and if I can do that if I can inform

1432
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,599
people I feel like I'll have done my

1433
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,559
part like I said earlier they can do

1434
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,280
what they want with that information but

1435
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,480
they need to have it and it needs to be

1436
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,440
accurate and accessible I'm very

1437
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,440
concerned about the mainstream narrative

1438
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,119
around cannabis I do think that we're

1439
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,159
kind of in this weird reer Madness 2.0

1440
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:26,838
every day you see headlines of oh

1441
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,279
teenagers sick from gummies or can abis

1442
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:31,719
causes psychosis right all this

1443
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,400
fearmongering is continuing just in a

1444
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:35,078
different sort of way and so I really

1445
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,480
want to combat that do I think that

1446
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,318
cannabis is for everybody absolutely not

1447
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,039
but do I think that everyone can benefit

1448
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:44,558
from some accurate information about the

1449
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:47,719
plant 100% yes yeah yeah

1450
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,880
totally yeah it's it's interesting the

1451
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:53,000
people out there are just in every

1452
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,240
direction and and we're so divided yeah

1453
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,239
so politically divided it is interesting

1454
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:59,798
though to see how bipartisan support for

1455
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,919
cannabits has increased right like

1456
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:04,039
totally Republicans get high Democrats

1457
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,318
get high like everyone everyone's just

1458
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:08,039
getting high so well politicians are

1459
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:11,000
making money on it on both sides too

1460
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:12,039
totally so yeah and I mean it's just

1461
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
it's one of those things it's for

1462
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:15,920
everybody I I think it's for everybody

1463
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,440
it may not be for you but it it is there

1464
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,559
for everybody yes yeah it is there for

1465
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,920
everybody and frankly going back to the

1466
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,440
minor cannaboids maybe there kind of is

1467
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,280
a cannabis for every person when you

1468
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,280
break it down and I speaking of the

1469
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,920
future future I think that's going to be

1470
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,200
really interesting because right now

1471
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,000
we're only really talking about a

1472
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,000
handful of cannaboid and a handful of

1473
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,159
tpin but what are we going to discover

1474
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,119
and isolate and see and like the strains

1475
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,118
that will grow in the future will we

1476
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:43,720
will will there be different cannaboids

1477
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,079
that we don't even know about yet dude

1478
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:47,719
you go to the doctor and they give you a

1479
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:50,359
custom canono profile that's designed

1480
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:52,000
for your your specific receptors with

1481
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:54,400
your ailments I mean there's there's all

1482
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,760
kinds of potential for stuff you that's

1483
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,119
abstracts you follow them a lot think

1484
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,440
they do some amazing stuff I think

1485
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:02,559
they're pushing boundaries I like the

1486
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,240
direction they're going uh I think we

1487
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,119
need more people doing that and more

1488
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:09,078
people doing it publicly there are

1489
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:11,000
private companies that are totally doing

1490
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:14,400
a lot of stuff say similar research they

1491
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,358
know a lot about it uh but yeah I think

1492
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,920
just the general public needs to be made

1493
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:21,159
aware of so many different aspects of

1494
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,838
the plant you know beyond tpes they're

1495
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:24,199
you know they're talking about

1496
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,159
flavorants which I think is awesome you

1497
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:28,598
know which we called THS back in the day

1498
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:32,639
but now they've really started to Define

1499
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:35,000
them uh there was just a post from Max

1500
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,598
montros and he was talking about Jack

1501
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,199
herrer why the pens don't taste like

1502
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,359
Jack herrer and why you don't have the

1503
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:44,399
same Association to like the extract

1504
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:46,558
like an extract uh that's added turps as

1505
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,400
you do to the flower but Jack's changed

1506
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,319
too I used to like Jack back in the day

1507
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,559
yeah and I don't like most of the Jack

1508
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:53,880
no why do you think that is because I

1509
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,240
think they have a phenotype that's

1510
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,960
inferior I think people are growing

1511
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:59,439
stuff that's not as good I the jack that

1512
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,880
I had was completely

1513
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,159
different uh you know it was similar

1514
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,119
like very

1515
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:11,558
limey uh but I would say it was way more

1516
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:13,318
complex and it had a super amazing taste

1517
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:15,200
better than the one today the one today

1518
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:17,679
is okay but it's not as complex yeah

1519
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:20,598
right jack is okay for me it's like on

1520
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,440
the the bottom tier so whereas Jack back

1521
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:24,318
in the day if we could we' pay $60 for

1522
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,519
an Athan Jack back in the day damn and

1523
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:29,318
it was freaking

1524
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,280
light your light your uh head on fire

1525
00:54:29,318 --> 00:54:33,039
You' be

1526
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,359
ripped and you know and we used to smoke

1527
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,039
the little small joints of it be super

1528
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:39,838
high and share those with three or four

1529
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:41,798
of us wow and now that's like a personal

1530
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,798
joint you know we smoke the big the

1531
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:45,599
bigger ones now yeah so what do you have

1532
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:48,239
in there we got some Skittles oh

1533
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,920
Skittles nice it's fun it's daytime weed

1534
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,078
we love a skittles yeah you can't go

1535
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,599
wrong with Skittles that's something

1536
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,318
like everybody likes but we have to call

1537
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:56,119
it the original Z now right we're we're

1538
00:54:54,318 --> 00:55:00,159
not allowed to say the The Strain formly

1539
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:02,680
know SK it's like the prince of weed do

1540
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:05,719
you find that interesting um the fact

1541
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:07,960
that we have so many varieties named

1542
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:10,598
after other things and kind of dude

1543
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,760
trademark infringement all over yeah

1544
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,960
like yeah I mean I think that's that's

1545
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,960
the sign of an immature

1546
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,960
Market

1547
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,318
um that's just how it goes I think

1548
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,440
especially with cannabis because it was

1549
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,199
illegal there was no trademark

1550
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,920
infringement who you go after you know

1551
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,639
it's like so people just did whatever

1552
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,559
you know they wanted some Jedi strain

1553
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:36,078
they were going to call some violate

1554
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:38,798
Disney trademarks and got their Pikachu

1555
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:42,880
or whatever the Skywalker OG right I

1556
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:45,079

1557
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,559
mean grape Hau one of my favorites

1558

1582
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:50,318
when people talk about how like THC

1583
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,960

00:56:57,798 --> 00:57:02,159
we it was almost a ritual we had we I

1588
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,240
remember going to this Rave called

1589
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:07,798
freedom and I believe it was on the 4th

1590
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:11,679
of July and it was like in Oakley up on

1591
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:14,559
these Hills these and it was like Sandy

1592
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,440
and grass and like the it wasn't like

1593
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,000
dirt regular dirt it was like dirt with

1594
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,880
sand in it and we had tents and then we

1595
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,880
drank this bang and it was like you

1596
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,640
might as well have done some acid or

1597
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,200
something like that it was on that level

1598
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,759
no way yeah that sounds I've never I've

1599
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,798

1600
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,079
stories about it um you saying that

1601
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:36,159
though makes me

1602
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:38,039
anxious it was but so he used some stuff

1603
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,879
that was like not to where my heart was

1604
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:42,400
palpitating I didn't get the bad the

1605
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,920
negative effect oh good like we

1606
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,200
sometimes with Edibles people freak out

1607
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,039
I didn't freak out at all yeah and I

1608
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,960
freaked out from Edibles before yeah

1609
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:52,079
unfortunately I've been there for sure I

1610
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,000
had an incident on an airplane one time

1611
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,200
coming back from La I think I I ate like

1612
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,079
a I don't even know what it was it was

1613
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,719
it was some traditional Market thing so

1614
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:02,599
there's that right there you know you

1615
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,118
know it's going to be strong and I got

1616
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,640
on the plane and we were taxing to take

1617
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,119
off and I started feeling really hot and

1618
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:11,118
like my heart started racing and I felt

1619
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,039
kind of sick almost and I was anxious

1620
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,760
and the guy next to me he just thought I

1621
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,200
was anxious about the flight he's like

1622
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,839
don't worry it's fine this is just

1623
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:20,000
another flight and I was like I start

1624
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:22,920
freaking out I start feeling I'm going

1625
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,920
to be sick and we start taking off and

1626
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,680
I'm like I'm going to be sick you know

1627
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:29,039
you can't stand up you can't do anything

1628
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:30,598
there was no sick bag and so as soon as

1629
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,400
we were kind of up and it was almost

1630
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:34,119
like acceptable to stand up I just ran

1631
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,240
to the back and it was just like sick

1632
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:37,920
and I was just like sweating and just

1633
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,159
paranoid the whole flight it was just

1634
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,000
such a nightmare I was like oh why did I

1635
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:45,440
eat that that's rough yeah it was the

1636
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,559
worst I'm really always an advocate for

1637
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,240
knowing your limits you know and this

1638
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:53,599
whole you know go slow start start low

1639
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:56,318
go slow yeah that whole thing because I

1640
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,720
really hate the idea that people try

1641
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,838
cannabis for the first time and I think

1642
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:01,519
this is happening more often now people

1643
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,759
try cannabis for the first time they're

1644
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:06,239
not well informed and then they end up

1645
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,440
having a bad time they have paranoia

1646
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,959
they get sick you know they're

1647
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,480
uncomfortable whatever it is literally

1648
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,679
you know and then they're going to tell

1649
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,639
their friends yeah and they'll never do

1650
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,719
it again exactly and that's I have

1651
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,199
friends like that when we were kids that

1652
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:21,038
they never smoked after that I mean I

1653
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:22,279
talk to them now sometimes but uh they

1654
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,839
got too high the first time and then

1655
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,680
they never wanted to smoke yeah yeah no

1656
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:28,759
it's unfortunate and like

1657
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:30,519
I'm a huge huge advocate for knowing

1658
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,160
your limits for knowing what's right for

1659
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:36,199
you take one little hit yeah wait 5 10

1660
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,798
minutes you know you're going to eat a

1661
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:39,679
gummy you don't need five milligrams two

1662
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:41,960
and a half milligrams I get really

1663
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,919
concerned about what the bud tenders are

1664
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,280
arm of the gummy Bear just start with

1665
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,720
that just start with the arm one one

1666
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,280
little toe yeah yeah Joe Rogan had a a

1667
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,759
comedy show I think he was in San

1668
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,160
Francisco when he talked about that

1669
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,640
about how the Edibles are so strong you

1670
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:57,399
just need like the ear of the gummy bear

1671
00:59:55,639 --> 01:00:01,400
or something

1672
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:03,559
hilarious no it's it's facts and I just

1673
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,318
I really get concerned about how the bud

1674
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:08,119
tenders are portraying the plant and

1675
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:10,079
it's it's not on them right and I think

1676
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:12,200
that they don't necessarily always have

1677
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,599
the best training but I'm wondering what

1678
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:15,798
you think about that you know what can

1679
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,039
we do on the retail level I mean I'm

1680
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:20,239
trying as hard as I can with articles

1681
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:22,319
and you know online but what can we do

1682
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,838
to actually educate the consumers so

1683
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,000
that they don't have a bad time so they

1684
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:29,078
don't freak out on an airplane give them

1685
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,880
CBD with their weed yeah I mean but but

1686
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:34,318
other than that I mean honestly I would

1687
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,880
say that you awareness and education

1688
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,159
people need to know that like if you do

1689
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,760
too much it's not one of those things

1690
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:40,920
you just do as much as you can the first

1691
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,920
time you need to really take it slow I

1692
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,680
think the more we share awareness about

1693
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,720
it the better it is for people um you

1694
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:52,960
know they in California we do have like

1695
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:56,118
super super like low THC Edibles like

1696
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,960
it's super low MH you know so I think

1697
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,440
that in you know it's what is it 5

1698
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,960
milligram dose and or up to 10

1699
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,760
milligrams per dose and only 100

1700
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,318
milligrams per package right right so 10

1701
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,079
milligrams that gets me high I get high

1702
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:11,480
from that that's a pretty good high like

1703
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,839
but even five milligrams that's a great

1704
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,358
place to start for an edible for the

1705
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:17,920
average person but some people can go up

1706
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:20,000
to 50 back in the day we used to eat 500

1707
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,680
not even think twice you know it's like

1708
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,960
we literally tried to put as much as we

1709
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,598
could in the brownies like literally we

1710
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,798
we had butter we we wanted it the

1711
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:30,640
strongest butter possible and it was

1712
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,599
strong I bet it was somewhere between 3

1713
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,558
and 500 milligrams of brownie and we

1714
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:36,960
would eat those you know I've often

1715
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,760
wondered about that what were the

1716
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,079
milligrams in my homemade brownies and

1717
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,000
cookies you know back in the day I

1718
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:44,359
definitely remember having some pretty

1719
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,920
intense times I tried to go to a hockey

1720
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:47,239
game one time after eating one of my

1721
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,079
brownies and I had to leave after the

1722
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:50,078
first period I was like I don't like

1723
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:52,519
this

1724
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,039
energy but yeah it's it's always a it's

1725
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:55,639
a guessing game but I would almost push

1726
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:57,079
back on on the five milligrams I feel

1727
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:58,838
like that can be too much for a first-

1728
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:00,559
timer I think I think two and a half

1729
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:02,278
honestly is a great place to start for a

1730
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,519
lot of folks just because you don't know

1731
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:04,880
that's why this Show's good we're

1732
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,318
talking about awareness now I'm like

1733
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,760
five and years two and a half and you're

1734
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:11,079
probably right and I think less is more

1735
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,680
especially with drugs totally and this

1736
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:14,240
is a drug coffee is a drug I'm not

1737
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:17,440
saying anything negative about the

1738
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:20,479
planum it's a drug and I think it has

1739
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,079
impact and starting in a small place is

1740
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,000
great there's nothing wrong with micro

1741
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,960
doing either you know it's like with

1742
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,199
micro doing weed where you don't even

1743
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,798
feel it there is positive benefits to

1744
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:32,639
that too yeah absolutely and you can

1745
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,519
always work your way up the problem with

1746
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,118
with weed and a lot of other substances

1747
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:37,639
is you can't necessarily work your way

1748
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,240
down you know once it's in there you

1749
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:41,159
can't get it up it's on you just got to

1750
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:44,000
wait it up yeah and like maybe you can

1751
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:46,038
take a high high dose of CBD or actually

1752
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,039
my staff writer Cara she's working on a

1753
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:49,880
piece right now testing out all these

1754
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:51,760
products that promise to help you come

1755
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,880
down if you get too high there's several

1756
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,319
things on the market I don't really know

1757
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,278
what they are if they're just like a

1758
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:57,798
high CBD energy shot kind of it looks

1759
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:59,079
like I don't know the formulation but

1760
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:01,838
I'm really interested in hearing how

1761
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:03,839
they work out and if those products are

1762
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:05,519
viable on the market because I don't

1763
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,759
really see them in dispensaries or

1764
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,798
anything like that I don't see anybody

1765
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,160
pushing these products so is it

1766
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:11,798
something that we should have for for

1767
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,639
harm reduction purposes you know

1768
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:16,559
available or maybe yeah throw it in the

1769
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:19,000
uh in the outbag like a high CBD 50

1770
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,278
milligram capsule or something just in

1771
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,639
case I mean it's because these are the

1772
01:03:21,278 --> 01:03:24,719
things that science is going to help

1773
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,719
formulate over time to how what's the

1774
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:30,000
fastest delivery mechanism that we can

1775
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,278
do is it taking a dab is it eating a

1776
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,480
pill that has you know that's that's

1777
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:35,920
basically has some form of fat or some

1778
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,920
something that'll basically make it

1779
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,318
absorb

1780
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:43,760
faster um sublingual yeah this like the

1781
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:45,920
sprays under the new ways of doing patch

1782
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,960
yeah new CBD patches I mean it's really

1783
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,599
cool this stuff is really cool and you

1784
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,400
know I find it really interesting all

1785
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,240
the different uses and all the different

1786
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:58,000
potential uh methods for delivery that

1787
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:59,479
they have and some of them are wild and

1788
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,519
some of them are unnecessary and that's

1789
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,559
always going to be the case when you're

1790
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:04,440
doing stuff it's like I see stuff all

1791
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,480
the time that's maybe not necessary but

1792
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,838
it's like someone was creative and you

1793
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,240
have enough creative ideas you're going

1794
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:13,400
to come up with some really cool stuff

1795
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:15,919
as far as you know weed technology and

1796
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,960
Innovation we were in a crazy R&amp;D period

1797
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,798
over the last decade you've obviously

1798
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,000
seen a lot and especially when it comes

1799
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:23,759
to breeding and growing all the

1800
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,960
technology but on the consumer facing

1801
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,599
level whether it's you know devices or

1802
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,519
use cases what are some of the things

1803
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:32,480
that have stuck out to you as like okay

1804
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:35,400
that actually is a game changer LED

1805
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,480
lights yeah Game

1806
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,599
Changer um crop

1807
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,159
steering Game

1808
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:45,039
Changer um

1809
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:49,038
breeding

1810
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:50,559
Skittles no I mean I love Skittles I

1811
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,119
think that there's been some genetics

1812
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:55,160
over time it's just like there's two

1813
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:57,119
guitarists that Chang the world jimmi

1814
01:04:55,159 --> 01:05:00,199
Hendricks Eddie Van

1815
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,838
Halen um beyond that there's been other

1816
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:04,318
amazing guitars too but those those were

1817
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:06,679
the ones what do you think that the

1818
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,880
genetics were that changed the world

1819
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:11,000
that's a really good question because

1820
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,680
you go all the way back you know you

1821
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,440
think about the original land race

1822
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:17,078
strains and how far they've come but as

1823
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,960
far as genetic markers within our

1824
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:21,680
timeline of the last like 10 20 years I

1825
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,720
mean obviously like Girl Scout cookies

1826
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:26,639
was huge right it's it felt like for an

1827
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:29,000
entire decade everything was sort of do

1828
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,679
turp you know and the Skittles I think

1829
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,358
as well you know that Z is everywhere

1830
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:35,358
people love it people continue to ask

1831
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,318
for it and so I think that's really

1832
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,920
interesting but going back I think you

1833
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:42,920
know strains like blue dream for sure

1834
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,680
like Jack Herrera the OG Kush obviously

1835
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,599
I'm waiting for another one another one

1836
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:49,118
chem 91 I think was the biggest game

1837
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:52,960
changer I think chem 91 it was the bag

1838
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,880
seed that was found uh on the lot yeah

1839
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,400
legendary well really I mean there's

1840
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,760
more to that story but but it was the

1841
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,639
meeting happened on the lot the seeds

1842
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,480
came later but because of the Grateful

1843
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:06,159
Dead um really really amazing uh and

1844
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,960
Game Changer to this you know I think

1845
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,159
that's what got gas into everything

1846
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,199
that's when people started really

1847
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:15,118
appreciating gas uh OG Kush that's

1848
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:19,000
another one and like if you look at the

1849
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:20,798
phos studies of OG Kush they have 90

1850
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,559
different things that aren't called OG

1851
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:25,119
Kush that are genetically identical to

1852
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,519
OG Kush really yeah so that means people

1853
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:30,079
rename at 90 different things which

1854
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:33,079
means it was probably 500 different

1855
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:35,000
things um so OG cusher Game Changer yeah

1856
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:37,798
blue dream I think is a game changer too

1857
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:42,358
I think that's a super important one uh

1858
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:44,920
cookies yeah uh Jack Herrera in its day

1859
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:46,798
Super Silver Haze yes I feel like super

1860
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,559
silver back in the day was a huge game

1861
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,759
changer I mean we could go back even

1862
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,599
further with like Hindu Kush and some of

1863
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,000
the people that brought the original

1864
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:56,838
kushes you know those were all game

1865
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
changers we had the Master Kush and the

1866
01:06:56,838 --> 01:07:01,400
Bubba Kush and the

1867
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,519
ogs those were all in my lifetime but

1868
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,039
before that there was you know Afghan

1869
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:08,278
people were bringing stuff back

1870
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:10,400
pre-soviet Afghanistan yeah no I'm

1871
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:11,719
really I love hearing about what weed

1872
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,039
they were smoking back in the day my

1873
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,078
friend's dad's always talking about

1874
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:16,839
Panama Red yeah and I remember people

1875
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:19,278
talking about like tie stick when I was

1876
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:22,679
a kid and and I went to I was an opair

1877
01:07:19,278 --> 01:07:24,079
in Amsterdam and I had been hearing

1878
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,199
about the tie stick and the chocolate

1879
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,079
tie when I was really young and and gray

1880
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:31,759
area that coffee shop John from the gray

1881
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:33,240
area great guy so I was in there and I

1882
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,440
was talking about like oh is there any

1883
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:35,598
place where I can get this type of weed

1884
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,000
and he's like oh you don't even know

1885
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,760
like we're growing a chocolate tie right

1886
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,079
now it's not ready yet but it'll be here

1887
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:45,200
in like March this was in maybe November

1888
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,160
or December at the time and I was like

1889
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:47,719
okay I'm going to come back I'm going to

1890
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:50,719
keep my eye on that and I end up leaving

1891
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:52,519
Amsterdam I got fired for my opar job um

1892
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:54,118
and I never got to try their chocolate

1893
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:56,239
tie at gray area and it's something I've

1894
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:58,760
always regretted my whole life you know

1895
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:01,000
then I was smoking a lot of silver haze

1896
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,079
a lot of white widow like all the white

1897
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,559
widow I want to see some of those

1898
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,000
strains make a comeback what strain do

1899
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,839
you want to see make a comeback this is

1900
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,159
not a trick question everybody who

1901
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:11,920
watches the show knows I want ciss that

1902
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:14,318
is absolutely the one that ciss like

1903
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,239
that is uh I'm sure our producers been

1904
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:19,238
waiting for me to say cat piss on this

1905
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:21,318
episode but I love I want the cat piss

1906
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:22,919
we are doing the documentary on it we

1907
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:24,319
keep talking about the documentary but

1908
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,838
like we're going to be recreating the

1909
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:30,199
capus uh

1910
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:32,559
doing several crosses to get something

1911
01:08:30,198 --> 01:08:35,678
similar to what I remember as ciss but

1912
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,199
ciss is also the description of an aroma

1913
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,719
I think there's multiple cat pisses I

1914
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,838
don't think there's just one cross I

1915
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:44,158
think there could be potentially several

1916
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:47,158
and it's not like blue dream or Romulan

1917
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:48,879
or super silver haze where there're a

1918
01:08:47,158 --> 01:08:51,838
specific name and it doesn't really

1919
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:54,560
describe the aroma or you know the smell

1920
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:56,039
of it where you CA something piss I mean

1921
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,520
you could it

1922
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:00,880
I could see how that could get you know

1923
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,520
changed into several things over time

1924
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:06,838
yeah absolutely well and I think that is

1925
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,759
also very interesting uh in our

1926
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,359
community is the fact that you have so

1927
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:12,039
much of that where it was like maybe an

1928
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:13,719
OG Kush but then they changed the name

1929
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:15,719
or whatever and it was kind of lost and

1930
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:18,560
then those genetics continued and the

1931
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,960
lack of consistency in the marketplace

1932
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,279
and people don't actually know for sure

1933
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,960
what they're getting but they think they

1934
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:26,799
do right the consumers are like oh the

1935
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:29,560
package says OG Kush so it must OG Kush

1936
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,039
right and totally it ruins weed that

1937
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,480
just yeah I mean that's the same thing

1938
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:35,238
where like the first impression is so

1939
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:36,358
important like if if you get a for the

1940
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:38,000
first time you get something that's

1941
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:40,880
called OG cush and it's garbage you're

1942
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,359
like OG Kush sucks yeah right and so

1943
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,279
like that happens all the time and so a

1944
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,039
lot of people are like oh this sucks or

1945
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,759
that sucks and there's a lot of cut

1946
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:51,880
fishing going on so on top of all this

1947
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,479
with the cut fishing then somebody gives

1948
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,679
you something like this is OG Kush you

1949
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:56,639
grow it out you don't know any better

1950
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:58,960
you think it's OG Kush and that happened

1951
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,119
10 times over so there's 10 people now

1952
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,600
that are giving and sharing and Crossing

1953
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:05,359
it and saying I crossed this with OG

1954
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,679
Kush but it's not really crossed with OG

1955
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:10,639
Kush and so that's where the Dilemma

1956
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:12,039
comes in like how do we solve this big

1957
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,640
problem because this is a problem this

1958
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:15,640
is a huge problem and I think we're not

1959
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,679
talking enough about how big of a

1960
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,039
problem it really is because it's

1961
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:22,520
happening all over all the time how does

1962
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:24,600
it make you feel as a breeder I think I

1963
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,679
can look at stuff from the outside and

1964
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,480
it doesn't piss me me off as much as

1965
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:30,359
maybe it pisses off other people I'm

1966
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,559
more of a Solutions based person anyway

1967
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:35,079
so I'm like okay what's the solution

1968
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,719
fingerprinting we go to my flid DNA

1969
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:38,559
shout out to those guys we can

1970
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,480
fingerprint all our genetics now if we

1971
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:44,080
sell the cuts we can fingerprint them we

1972
01:10:41,479 --> 01:10:45,559
can verify it if somebody calls it that

1973
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,679
then we can go look at my floor we can

1974
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:50,159
test their flower sample we're like okay

1975
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,199
they got it or they don't have it which

1976
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:56,279
damn it that cut leaked they it got out

1977
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:58,158
to the world and I think technology is

1978
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:00,479
going to solve the problem right because

1979
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:03,639
there's so many people that are

1980
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:08,039
just okay with uh changing the names

1981
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:11,360
apparently yeah there are people that do

1982
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:14,439
bad things and then there's facts and so

1983
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,799
hopefully we can win the war with uh

1984
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:18,960
facts and beat these people out that are

1985
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,480
just totally yeah I mean there's there's

1986
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,279
bullies and there's bad people all over

1987
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:25,399
yeah absolutely and I guess both of us

1988
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:28,359
are doing that in our own individual way

1989
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:30,920
yeah you know as a writer I'm trying to

1990
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:33,599
work for truth there's a lot of fake

1991
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:36,039
news out there even in the weed media so

1992
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,079
much you know and how can we approach it

1993
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:41,359
from a space of just truth and wanting

1994
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:43,119
to do better as an industry and and

1995
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:45,039
wanting to level us up and help us be

1996
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:47,238
more professional in the eyes of the

1997
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:49,519
mainstream American who's just waiting

1998
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:52,079
for us to clown yeah there's so many

1999
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,960
people who dog on us because they know

2000
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,079
that at the end of the day it's like oh

2001
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,399
you guys are just an underground Market

2002
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:59,198
you don't know what you're doing out

2003
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,799
here in the real world but we do you

2004
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:02,599
know a lot of us strive to be

2005
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,320
professionals and to be good stewards of

2006
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,880
the plant and so and it's it's hard when

2007
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:09,599
you see so much infighting and [ __ ]

2008
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,000
talking you know when it's like we're

2009
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,239
all on the same team it's really

2010
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,880
frustrating yeah well and I think so

2011
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:17,759
back going back to fingerprinting and

2012
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,400
and why that's valuable I think when you

2013
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,560
have a fingerprint of something that you

2014
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:23,719
created or that you have in your hands I

2015
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,679
think that that's valuable yeah and I

2016
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:28,719
think that there's no negative side to

2017
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:31,679
that because you Prov that you had it at

2018
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:33,880
a certain point in time right and so as

2019
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:37,800
a breeder with our collection being able

2020
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:40,319
to collect uh markers on everything I

2021
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,199
think is so huge also for for breeding

2022
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:44,799
in the future it's like part of what we

2023
01:12:42,198 --> 01:12:46,839
do is data collection you know that's as

2024
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,800
a breeder what you do is data collection

2025
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,480
I would say that a large part of what we

2026
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,360
do that we don't even talk about is data

2027
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:55,559
collection yeah so and you know the the

2028
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:59,920
more advanced we get we're using sofware

2029
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:01,600
now it's not all on little books so I

2030
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,319
think it's it's amazing that the

2031
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,920
potential with AI in the future too is

2032
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:07,880
going to be super incredible uh

2033
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,239
especially predictive modeling for

2034
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,639
breeding I mean that's a GameChanger

2035
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:13,879
yeah I would assume that there's a lot

2036
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:15,359
of excitement around that and I think

2037
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,679
there's a lot of people scared of it too

2038
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:17,920
and it's like man you got to embrace it

2039
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:19,560
it's going to happen no matter what so

2040
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,840
let's embrace it and let's figure out

2041
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,280
how to make it work for us yeah exactly

2042
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,679
and I think it would have huge benefit

2043
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,079
for the producers and just the supply

2044
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:27,440
chain in General right I mean well I

2045
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:28,960
mean a lot of people think that breeding

2046
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,839
is just crossing this with this and you

2047
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,399
get this and that's not that's not what

2048
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,960
real breeding is it has a lot to do with

2049
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,638
the selection and then breeding over

2050
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:40,079
time and um true breeding takes a lot of

2051
01:13:36,639 --> 01:13:41,079
work yeah no I would assume so and so

2052
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:45,760
this would take some of the guest

2053
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:48,840
workout no it would and it increases the

2054
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,560
potential of what you can do which I

2055
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,800
think is the most amazing thing I mean

2056
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,360
there there's one it's one thing to be

2057
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,560
breeding and look at a plant and going

2058
01:13:56,359 --> 01:13:59,439
okay well this one yields and this you

2059
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,360
know we're going to bre the one that

2060
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,799
yields the most with this and then the

2061
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:05,759
next time you select okay in that proy

2062
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,159
we got these specific turb profiles and

2063
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,159
this is the big producer right and then

2064
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:13,238
you can do that over and over but using

2065
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:15,359
data to breed is going to be the biggest

2066
01:14:13,238 --> 01:14:17,119
game changer ever because now I mean

2067
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:18,880
they've been doing a big a for a while

2068
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:21,279
and now taking all that information and

2069
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,359
applying it to cannabis we got guys

2070
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:25,559
doing incredible things and that's not

2071
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,119
even uh GMO

2072
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,480
we're talking about just data driven

2073
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:32,238
breeding what do you say to the people

2074
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:33,959
who are anxious about the technology

2075
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,399
coming into the grow who feel like it

2076
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,319
doesn't have a place what do you say to

2077
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:38,960
those

2078
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:42,840
people uh I think that everybody has a

2079
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,520
purpose and whether you feel that it has

2080
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,840
a place or not it's

2081
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,760
happening um and maybe your purpose is

2082
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,079
breeding maybe it's not if you know you

2083
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,679
want to get on the bandwagon you want to

2084
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:55,840
still do it your classic way up in the

2085
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:59,719
hills and you know uh

2086
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,319
go along with the the traditional Market

2087
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:02,920
that's okay you can do that I mean

2088
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:04,880
there's nothing wrong with that I think

2089
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,039
that's slowly going away but like

2090
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,719
breeding is getting a lot more

2091
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:10,039
scientific and people are taking to the

2092
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:12,119
next level so either you educate

2093
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:14,198
yourself or you get left behind and I

2094
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:16,119
think that's kind of what my book was

2095
01:15:14,198 --> 01:15:17,719
about at least to start that dialogue

2096
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:20,039
and then the next version of the book is

2097
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:21,319
going to have even more information on

2098
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:23,119
you know the more I learn the more is's

2099
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:24,679
going in the book I like that you want

2100
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:26,279
to share the information with the world

2101
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:27,440
I think you're right people can do what

2102
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:29,439
they want with it just like I said

2103
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,158
earlier with my writing it's like you

2104
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,399
have the information now that's

2105
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:34,759
all do with it what you will we put it

2106
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:36,879
out there all we can do is put it out

2107
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,000
there and if the world likes it the

2108
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,159
world likes it and if they don't they

2109
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,719
don't yeah but yeah I mean it's like and

2110
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:44,799
the thing is is with technology it's I

2111
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,119
think it has the potential to make the

2112
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,279
world a better

2113
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:49,719
place now whether that happens or not

2114
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:52,198
that's a whole different story but the

2115
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:53,760
potential is there yeah I don't think

2116
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:56,439
we're going to see Skynet in the grow

2117
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,480
room or anything like that not yet no

2118
01:15:56,439 --> 01:16:01,759
totally no so yeah or Monsanto comes for

2119
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:05,158
for all my seeds yeah no I don't think

2120
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,159
that's going to happen they're not corn

2121
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,519
seeds yeah but cannabis is becoming such

2122
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,119
a huge cash crop though like I've been

2123
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,760
watching you know they always put out

2124
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:13,960
data like oh now it's bigger than this

2125
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,360
and bigger than that and bigger than

2126
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,560
that do you think that Trend will

2127
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:18,319
continue or do you think there'll be

2128
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,840
more Market compression especially if we

2129
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:21,399
go into a an interstate commerce

2130
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,960
situation I can't wait for interstate

2131
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:25,399
commerce yeah but I feel like we're

2132
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:28,039
going to have our ups and downs and uh

2133
01:16:25,399 --> 01:16:31,000
there will be heavy consolidation there

2134
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:32,439
it's just it look at Colorado you know

2135
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,679
Colorado is the best example if you look

2136
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:34,960
at Colorado the consolidation that

2137
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:37,399
happened there is going to happen

2138
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:41,239
everywhere uh especially with interstate

2139
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:43,119
and msos Multistate operators are going

2140
01:16:41,238 --> 01:16:46,559
to be everywhere because people want to

2141
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:48,639
expand their brands right and so that's

2142
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:53,560
good but I

2143
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:56,480
also uh look forward to Humble County

2144
01:16:53,560 --> 01:17:00,239
Trinity mesino and

2145
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:02,399
somoma having designated areas for

2146
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:04,839
terroir yes and to be able to do the

2147
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,559
farm to table experience yes where you

2148
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:10,039
can go up and you can meet the grower

2149
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,320
and it's like a w Winery Brewery hybrid

2150
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:12,719
that you get to meet the grower you

2151
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:13,599
maybe maybe there's a bed and breakfast

2152
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,880
there you could stay in the bed and

2153
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,079
breakfast or you could just go to The

2154
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,440
Tasting Room taste this stuff when

2155
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:20,760
they're harvesting you can go walk the

2156
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:22,719
fields and watch them Harvest and I

2157
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:25,560
think that is a cool experience and that

2158
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:27,439
can be Boutique and that can be you know

2159
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,039
craft and there's nothing wrong with

2160
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,960
craft there's always room for Budweisers

2161
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:35,279
and there there's plenty of room for

2162
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:37,639
Lanas and Russian River and these small

2163
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,119
breweries Lanas is now a big Brewery

2164
01:17:37,639 --> 01:17:41,319
they're like the hybrid too they're

2165
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:42,399
they're like they were they were craft

2166
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:43,479
and they grew and they grew and they

2167
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:45,759
grew and now they're you know a

2168
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:48,158
multi-billion dollar company but they

2169
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,480
produce good beer and so there's somewh

2170
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:50,759
there's something for everybody and

2171
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:52,678
that's the beauty of cannabis is there

2172
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,440
something for everybody not everybody

2173
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:58,079
likes the top actually everybody likes

2174
01:17:54,439 --> 01:18:00,238
the top but not everybody requires it or

2175
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:02,800
would be willing to pay more money for

2176
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:06,759
the best of the best of the best right

2177
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:09,079
exactly and I 100% agree with you there

2178
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,960
should be opportunity for every type of

2179
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:13,439
consumer to get what they need and what

2180
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,600
they want what's right for me might not

2181
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,279
be right for you and that's okay and I

2182
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,120
really love the idea of people being

2183
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:22,000
able to connect with their grower if

2184
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:23,198
they want to it's just like you can go

2185
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,079
to the farmers market and get your

2186
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,519
Tomatoes or you can get them at Walmart

2187
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,920
you know but consumers should be able to

2188
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:32,480
have a choice Walmart has yeah they have

2189
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,359
Walmart groceries man it's a

2190
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:37,119
thing I'm not saying they're any good

2191
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:39,920
but they exist totally they do exist

2192
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:42,559
yeah that's crazy so but yeah you know

2193
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,760
it's like I think I just want to really

2194
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,600
see the folks in the Emerald Triangle

2195
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,360
survive and be able to weather the storm

2196
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,079
and be able to invite those Folks up

2197
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:52,639
which a lot of them are doing right like

2198
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:54,800
I know Johnny and Rose they do stuff at

2199
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:56,600
their farm and soul Spirit they have

2200
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,159
clamping Retreats you can go and it's a

2201
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:01,280
full yeah uh experience I can't wait for

2202
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:04,359
that to expand and that to cuz that's

2203
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:06,198
the evolution of the Emerald Triangle

2204
01:19:04,359 --> 01:19:08,359
right I see that as being and there's

2205
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:09,879
huge consolidation that happened there

2206
01:19:08,359 --> 01:19:12,119
you know there was way more Brands there

2207
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,639
was way more people doing it and it

2208
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:15,800
became less and less and there's still

2209
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:17,319
guys doing it successfully but I it's

2210
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,119
going to grow it's going to grow again

2211
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:21,399
because it's meant to and I feel like

2212
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:23,519
there's plenty of places in the United

2213
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:26,679
States that could grow good cannabis and

2214
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,960
I'm all for it I love California I'm a

2215
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:30,199
Californian but uh where are some other

2216
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,439
places in the country that you think

2217
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:37,638
have fire weed Oregon for sure

2218
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:40,399
Washington has good weed yeah back

2219
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:43,679
East uh you get everywhere from Maine

2220
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:44,799
down to Florida there's there's good

2221
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,279
weed that can be found there I don't

2222
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,000
know if they're growing good weed in all

2223
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:50,079
those places but they're definitely

2224
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,198
doing some good stuff in Florida now I

2225
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:53,399
mean I think we've got some guys from

2226
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:55,158
Plenty of guys from Colorado they

2227
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:56,879
decided to go to Florida MH you know and

2228
01:19:55,158 --> 01:20:00,479
then same thing Maine

2229
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,600
and uh Massachusetts and Rhode Island I

2230
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:03,959
think they've got good stuff over there

2231
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,520
I have friends over there that are doing

2232
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,639
stuff so I know I haven't seen their

2233
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,679
flower but I'm assuming that it's top

2234
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:12,600
top top and uh some of my friends that

2235
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:13,920
used to you know people aren't having to

2236
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,840
come here for flower now they're just

2237
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,359
producing it over there I've heard that

2238
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,760
they have crazy good weed in Maine I've

2239
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:21,799
been waned to try it like Maine and

2240
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,119
Vermont I've been hearing amazing things

2241
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,199
about their bud I like the bud in

2242
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:27,000
Massachusetts too nice yeah

2243
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:28,799
Massachusetts another dead head

2244
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,359
Community there you know I feel like

2245
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,320
anywhere there was a big dead head

2246
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:34,158
Community there was like some good weed

2247
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:36,000
and good weed being grown yeah

2248
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:37,519
absolutely where do you think they

2249
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,520
there's room for improvement let's keep

2250
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,520
it political you know

2251
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,639
California so yeah well the funny thing

2252
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,399
is is like we have seen tons of

2253
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,359
improvement here but there's could

2254
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,759
always be more and I think on the on the

2255
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:52,799
rec side there is room for improvement

2256
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,320
everywhere definitely there is not one

2257
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,560
place that is hit it out of the park

2258
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:58,198
that's [ __ ] that I know of yeah that

2259
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,679
has just knocked it out and I feel like

2260
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:01,879
we all have our problems Washington has

2261
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:03,399
their own problems and they have fire

2262
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,560
weed I love the weed up in Washington

2263
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:07,599
man my friends my friends up there crush

2264
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,600
it they all crush it all you guys in

2265
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,079
Washington crush it I love the weed

2266
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,600
Oregon there's so many good places in

2267
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:15,880
Oregon but then they gave out licenses

2268
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,600
to everybody and then they did the stuff

2269
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:20,359
with

2270
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,440
betrus I mean come on guys like they

2271
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:25,079
didn't do it right either we we're no

2272
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:27,559
better I think uh Arizona did really

2273
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:29,880
good overall I think Arizona's model was

2274
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:32,719
good um I think there's good flower

2275
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:35,520
there there's for sure good flow um

2276
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:36,800
Earth ceilings got some good stuff uh

2277
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,080
there's there's other brands I'm sure

2278
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,440
that have good stuff in Arizona because

2279
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:41,719
I've seen it yeah um New Mexico I've

2280
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:44,638
have some friends in New Mexico that are

2281
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:46,760
crushing I think that but as far as like

2282
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:48,159
room for improvement everywhere it's got

2283
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,320
to improve because California look at

2284
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:52,479
2018 when it first hit the market it was

2285
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:53,639
garbage the wreck weed was garbage now

2286
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:56,359
you can actually find good stuff in

2287
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:59,039
wreck but not as much as you should

2288
01:21:56,359 --> 01:22:01,119
there's still a lot of mediocre product

2289
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,760
uh overpriced

2290
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:06,519
boof uh we can change that we need to

2291
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,719
change that it's G to happen it better

2292
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,679
happen yeah they need to get on that in

2293
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,439
New York because so far what I've been

2294
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:14,560
seeing in on the regulated side there

2295
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:15,759
it's like and it's expensive as hell

2296
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,199
it's no wonder that people just want to

2297
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,840
go to these illicit all the Bas yeah

2298
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:22,479
literally it's like not only are people

2299
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,520
confused about what's real and what's

2300
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,319
not what's legal what's not but if you

2301
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:29,360
you can get something for a quarter of

2302
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:31,079
the price and it's maybe even better

2303
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:33,759
twice as good but a quarter of the price

2304
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:35,119
yeah like what are you supposed to do so

2305
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,039
yeah I just I hope they can get it

2306
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:38,639
together because I really feel for the

2307
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:39,880
regulated operators out there there's

2308
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,480
some good people who are really trying

2309
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,520
to do it right and they're just miles

2310
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:47,319
behind of what these bodas are doing

2311
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:50,120
it's just it sucks for them yeah but I

2312
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:51,198
also be fair feel like there's always

2313
01:22:50,119 --> 01:22:52,639
going to be room for the traditional

2314
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:53,799
Market too and I'm an advocate for the

2315
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,840
traditional Market because I do think

2316
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,000
that people should be able to go to

2317
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,000
their farmers market or wherever their

2318
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,760
craft place and get what they want and

2319
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,719
know their grower and know their farmer

2320
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,039
and that if you want to go to a

2321
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:05,960
regulated dispensary you can do that too

2322
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:08,439
again it comes back to Consumer choice

2323
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:12,239
and just education I will assume the

2324
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:13,799
risk whichever path I take right yeah so

2325
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,279
did I get a strain from you if you could

2326
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,760
bring back anything what would you bring

2327
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:19,880
back I mean honestly thinking about that

2328
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,719
white widow I mean you don't really see

2329
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:23,960
white widow around we have the white

2330
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:25,359
widow I've seen in my life we had one

2331
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,279
white white Widow in the 90s that I

2332
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:28,679
think it was unrelated and you know

2333
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:30,238
there was some stuff out of Florida but

2334
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:33,480
like I never like white widow it was

2335
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:36,039
like the vanilla weed oh okay yeah the

2336
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,919
stuff in Europe it was like you cross it

2337
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:40,719
to anything and it vanilla fies that

2338
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,639
doesn't mean that I got the right wrong

2339
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,840
White Widow it probably means I got the

2340
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,520
wrong and maybe there was really good

2341
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,679
white widow we had stuff called The

2342
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,760
White Widow we called it the sweat but

2343
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,319
it was really supposedly White Widow oh

2344
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,760
okay but it made you sweat it would get

2345
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:57,198
you so high and it had a little nose

2346
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:59,199
burn to it M slightly kind of hazy but

2347
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,678
like that nose when you'd smoke it it

2348
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:04,039
would it burn and get you so high your

2349
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,520
eye it would be real tight eyes and we

2350
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,880
call it a sweat literally you'd start

2351
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,840
pouring in

2352
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,400
sweat and so that was the only time I

2353
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,560
got good white widow when I was overseas

2354
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:14,759
when we bought White Widow and I Spain

2355
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,080
Amsterdam never saw anything good that

2356
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,119
was like real white widow over there

2357
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:20,679
interesting yeah I always I'm trying to

2358
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:22,039
remember where I used to always shop

2359
01:24:20,679 --> 01:24:25,158
there was this

2360
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:27,760
place called a brais or I feel like they

2361
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:29,638
had they had decent white widdow um

2362
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,199
there was a strain that I smoked when I

2363
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:32,679
was young called Orange Crush at least

2364
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:34,439
that's what the guy called it Orange

2365
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:36,560
Crush I I absolutely remember Orange

2366
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:38,879
Crush I I always had an affinity for

2367
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,840
orange turps now it's kind of changing

2368
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:44,000
uh but I feel like Team Elite genetics

2369
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,600
has like an orange soda that's probably

2370
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,840
the most similar to that experience um

2371
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,320
but I'd love to see that one what turps

2372
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,480
do you think are making a comeback right

2373
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,920
now or what TPS I think gas is making

2374
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:57,839
comeback yeah I think so we been going

2375
01:24:54,920 --> 01:25:02,199
back and forth with gas and like the

2376
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:03,800
gelato M so like that floral candy gas

2377
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:05,439
propably purple candy gas what they call

2378
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,360
but really it's like the floral candy

2379
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:09,118
gas and some of the stuff leans heavy

2380
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:12,559
like the Joker leans heavy on the gas

2381
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:14,279
and I really like that side of it too

2382
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,880
and I feel like those are a lot a lot of

2383
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:17,880
times those are the stronger ones as

2384
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:22,359
well like the stronger smoke but I feel

2385
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:25,039
like we're going back to more gas we're

2386
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:27,439
going to go back to Citrus

2387
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:29,800
yes I think Tang is going to make it

2388
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:31,359
come back this next year I love Tangi

2389
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,880
yeah I think there's a lot of hate

2390
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,359
people on this show in the comments tell

2391
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,279
me how you feel about that but I feel

2392
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:38,479
like there's a lot of hate on Tangi yeah

2393
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:40,118
I like Tangi I I personally I mean I

2394
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:42,118
think you get sick of Tangi and then the

2395
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:45,719
world got sick of Tang it was so hot it

2396
01:25:42,118 --> 01:25:48,599

2397
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:50,800
2013 it was the it was the hot [ __ ] it

2398
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:52,920
was the hot it was the hot hot hot it

2399
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:56,920
was I mean Girl Scout cookies was

2400
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:58,440
popular here OG but like for High Times

2401
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,520
in like that

2402
01:25:58,439 --> 01:26:02,439
Community it was that was the one it was

2403
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:04,320
the most awarded thing every time it won

2404
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:05,960
and I think there was where people the

2405
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,799
judges would be like oh yeah they they

2406
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,480
know how it is so they how already set

2407
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,920
before they even started judging when

2408
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:12,000
they got to the Tang they were G to pick

2409
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:14,319
the

2410
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,880
Tangi yeah it it was definitely a

2411
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:19,719
standout and I know it's contentious but

2412
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,960
my fiance is actually growing a Tangi

2413
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:24,079
CBD strain for me right now and I'm

2414
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,960
super stoked about it honestly awesome

2415
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:27,880
yeah but I'd like to see more hazes too

2416
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,399
I'm doing some Haze work I'm doing so

2417
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,359
yeah I feel like that's the Lord's work

2418
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:33,279
these

2419
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:36,439
things these these plants take off I got

2420
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:39,759
a I got some maloi versus W hawen that A

2421
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:42,079
friend gave me okay uh from Mexico and

2422
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:45,320
I'm super excited about those they smell

2423
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:47,279
crazy and they're just super vigorous

2424
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:49,279
and so I'm I'm like ready to jump on

2425
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:50,639
that I think doing some work with that

2426
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:52,759
and then Crossing that back into some

2427
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,960
shorter flowering plants is going to be

2428
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,760
part of what we do this year lot of fun

2429
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,760
it's always it's always an adventure

2430
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,560
truly yeah it must be so exciting I mean

2431
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,000
for both of us in our own different ways

2432
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,159
right there's always something happening

2433
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,639
there's always new innovation yeah is

2434
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:07,039
there anything that people would ask you

2435
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:08,639
to bring back that you wouldn't bring

2436
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:11,639
back just on a personal level you're

2437
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,440
like purple punch you're over it no I

2438
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:15,199
never was into it oh okay I never liked

2439
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:17,439
purple punch I didn't like it for the

2440
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:19,118
first time I saw it I liked it yeah it

2441
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:20,799
was like one of the it's Instagram weed

2442
01:27:19,118 --> 01:27:23,519
it purple punch was the one where you're

2443
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:25,320
like oh wow looks amazing can't wait to

2444
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,719
smoke this same thing with some of the

2445
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:29,359
wedding cake fener types there is good

2446
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:32,198
wedding cake there's no good purple

2447
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:34,079
punch purple punch maybe an extract you

2448
01:27:32,198 --> 01:27:36,319
can get some okay tasting extract or

2449
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:38,319
whatever but as far as like rolling a

2450
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:41,198
joint of it you would light it up and

2451
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:42,559
instantly it would taste like nothing

2452
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:44,359
like you you don't get turps in the

2453
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,280
joints it was mild turps anyway to begin

2454
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:49,000
with and when you smoke big joints of it

2455
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:51,840
like the first hit you might almost get

2456
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,639
a little turp and then it would just

2457
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,800
taste you might as well smoke a

2458
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:57,359
cigarette yeah that's that's how it was

2459
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,719
and there there's a bunch of stuff like

2460
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,920
I'm not a big Oreos fan either like the

2461
01:27:59,719 --> 01:28:03,319
smoke of

2462
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,239
Oreos but I've said on my show a million

2463
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:07,279
times they're all one cross away from

2464
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,599
being amazing that's the beauty of this

2465
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,198
stuff is like you find something like

2466
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:12,600
purple punch you can cross it to stuff

2467
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:15,359
and make it great yeah it it does really

2468
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,520
well as a breeder Oreos does well as a

2469
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:18,880
breeder I've done some really

2470
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:22,000
interesting work with Oreos but as far

2471
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:24,679
as like it has like chocolaty mild TPS

2472
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,158
that aren't aren't interesting at all

2473
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:27,840
for me it's not interesting I like

2474
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,519
interesting turps yeah I don't mind

2475
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,679
Fried Chicken turps you know what I mean

2476
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,000
like but I want interesting yes so and I

2477
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,800
love finding those in the garden where

2478
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,359
you squeeze it and you're like oo that's

2479
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:40,840
fried chicken my my buddy I was in

2480
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:42,000
Seattle not maybe two years ago and uh

2481
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,039
we were going through and he's like dude

2482
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,920
you got to smell this it smells just

2483
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:47,920
like fried chicken dead on Fried Chicken

2484
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:50,039
turbs wow and I like I like a little bit

2485
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,719
of everything so I like variety I think

2486
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:54,279
variety as far as flavor you you get

2487
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:55,679
used to one thing and then you want try

2488
01:28:54,279 --> 01:28:58,158
something else the only thing is is like

2489
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,880
Skittles a lot of times I enjoy Skittles

2490
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:01,158
so much like if I have 50 different

2491
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,159
things and I get Skittles I'll smoke all

2492
01:29:01,158 --> 01:29:04,399
the Skittles before I go back into

2493
01:29:03,158 --> 01:29:07,319
everything else and sometimes it's

2494
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:09,118
whatever the best is yeah the Blue 13 is

2495
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:12,319
another one it's like straight amazing

2496
01:29:09,118 --> 01:29:13,880
blueberry turps green weed so what do

2497
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:15,439
you feel about that you like Green you

2498
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,279
you have preference on green versus

2499
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:20,678
purple or purple versus green I'm a

2500
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:22,920
bright green girl yeah for sure um no

2501
01:29:20,679 --> 01:29:25,118
shade on purple weed or or dark green

2502
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,760
weed but there's something about bright

2503
01:29:25,118 --> 01:29:29,439
green especially with like that lime

2504
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,280
green color yeah you know it's just

2505
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:33,839
there's just something about it and that

2506
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:35,759
almost looks fake yeah right like it

2507
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,000
shouldn't actually be weed is I feel

2508
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,199
like a lot of the cryo cure ends up

2509
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,158
looking like that to be honest with you

2510
01:29:38,198 --> 01:29:43,439
totally a lot of it does but is that

2511
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,960
more about bag appeal for the cryo here

2512
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:46,638
or do you think there's something there

2513
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,158
with that we're gonna find out yeah I

2514
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,279
guess so I'm actually I'm not sold on it

2515
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:52,479
at all I don't believe in it at all but

2516
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:55,238
they I'm willing to like see if someone

2517
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:57,079
could change my mind because I I think

2518
01:29:55,238 --> 01:30:00,000
the science of it there's

2519
01:29:57,079 --> 01:30:02,279
potential so we'll see and maybe people

2520
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,118
figure it out maybe they won't and but I

2521
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:07,479
think that that we have to do this stuff

2522
01:30:04,118 --> 01:30:09,479
over and over and over to try to figure

2523
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:11,439
stuff out to see how we can improve the

2524
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:14,638
plan improve the processes of drying

2525
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:17,238
curing storing you know LED lights LED

2526
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,279
lights are way more efficient than HPS

2527
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:21,479
and the thing is is now we have

2528
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:23,158
adjustable Spectrum so we can mimic uh

2529
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:25,479
certain spectrums and I think that's

2530
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:27,799
great because we're [ __ ] up the

2531
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:30,279
environment using HPS lights yeah at the

2532
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,960
end of the day they're they're not

2533
01:30:30,279 --> 01:30:34,279
costeffective either and they're really

2534
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,880
bad I mean we're producing so many you

2535
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:38,359
know if you want to do what's best for

2536
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,960
the planet we' just be growing Outdoors

2537
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:43,238
but I think mix light's the future too

2538
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:46,198
yeah I I definitely feel like mixed

2539
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:48,359
light doesn't get enough credit Yeah in

2540
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:49,759
our space and I think that they're doing

2541
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:53,158
a lot of really interesting stuff going

2542
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:56,159
to yeah it has to yeah well if you think

2543
01:30:53,158 --> 01:30:58,359
to compete your your prices have to go

2544
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:01,238
down and so your costs have to go down

2545
01:30:58,359 --> 01:31:03,399
if you want to make a profit and so to

2546
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:06,000
have to run the lowest cogs you're going

2547
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:08,399
to use mixed lights to get the best

2548
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,560
quality product that competes with

2549
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:14,118
indoor but costs a fraction of the price

2550
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:18,119
and so I think it competes and maybe

2551
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:20,839
beats indoor eventually and I've seen

2552
01:31:18,118 --> 01:31:22,679
some amazing you know mixed light and I

2553
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,880
I think it has the potential and I

2554
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:26,359
think as as a whole it's going to just

2555
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,079
get bigger and bigger and bigger because

2556
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:29,399
people are going to be more competitive

2557
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:32,719
especially for

2558
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:34,519
Quality um so we'll see it's exciting

2559
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,920
times it really is I can't wait to see

2560
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,760

DMs are open and always happy to hear a

2587
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:36,000
pitch um and I feel like there are a lot

2588
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,279
of people in our community that deserve

2589
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,079
to have their voices heard and they just

2590
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:42,279
don't know necessarily how to get it out

2591
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,880
there you don't need necessarily A

2592
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:46,319
publicist no shade on the publicist love

you guys um but not everyone can afford

2594
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:50,238
that or know how to go about it and so I

2595
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:52,239
encourage people to just share their

2596
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:54,039
