Vancouver Island so we're basically as

far west coast and South as you can go

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,439

right across from squim yeah yeah so

17
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,718
yeah no I I absolutely love it out there

18
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,759
I've been all over the mainland but um

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,960
well about I think about nine years ago

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,920
I had like a really bad home invasion

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,079
and I was just like screw this man I'm

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,760
moving to the island like it just I

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
lived in this area in chillak um British

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,479
Columbia where there were just like

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
people for a living were just going

26
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,799
around it's just like the home invasions

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,838
were so bad and these guys were like

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,079
pros too where they they come and they

29
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:08,478
drill a tiny hole through your you know

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,200
to figure out where you're at with like

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,200
little bullet cameras and come back at

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,840
the right time oh that's straight

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,159
Oakland style that that's been happening

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,880
in Oakland for 20 years and now it's

35
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,920
gone it's gone viral and gone all over

36
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,679
that's crazy yeah like pretty ruthless

37
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,359
too and violent too but I'm sure that's

38
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,040
like that here too I hear it's a bit of

39
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,879
an issue too Oakland now they'll just

40
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,840
crashing through the front door with a

41
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,560
vehicle with a stolen car stolen truck

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
and uh going through the front and

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,399
freaking empty you out and do whatever

44
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,280
and the cops don't come they don't do

45
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,320
much they don't do anything they they

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,320
don't do much and there's not much they

47
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,679
can do in a lot of instances you know

48
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,398
it's like uh the the laws are kind of

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,560
against all of us right now it's like

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,040
anything less than $900 you don't even

51
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,118
get arrested for it's not you know theft

52
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,920
is you know cited and released yeah

53
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,438
that's insane man yeah I know

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,039
everybody's been Waring me about don't

55
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,718
put anything in or just be so careful

56
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,719
it's that bad you really have to be

57
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:04,759
careful in San Francisco and Oakland you

58
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,599
don't want to have anything in your

59
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,159
vehicle in plain sight uh yeah it's it's

60
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,239
pretty rough are you guys allowed to

61
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,120
conceal or you're not you some people

62
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,680
have concealed but it's not it's not

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,000
very common hard to get it's hard to get

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,519
so it's harder to get it's still

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,919
possible but yeah it's not it's not a

66
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,120
normal thing for most people to have

67
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,559
conceal carries like Texas you don't see

68
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,360
that stuff happening yeah I was just

69
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,878
going to say if everybody's packing it's

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,519
like it's obviously got to change a lot

71
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,239
of stuff but it's like the wild West out

72
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,640
here and I guess with the value um like

73
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,800
in Canada the price of cannabis has just

74
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,119
gone down like we've seen areas that you

75
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,200
guys or territory that you guys haven't

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
seen yet because you guys still have red

77
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,518
States and obviously there's still

78
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,799
thriving markets of people pushing stuff

79
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,400
everywhere right I mean we're seeing the

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,280
race to the bottom uh it's it's

81
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,400
interesting though I I see stability

82
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,199
happening too because we've just in

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
California was 2018 they went

84
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,439
recreational right so we had medical

85
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,840
first before anybody in 1996

86
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,759
and then prop

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,039
215 and then 2018 we passed for

88
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,798
recreational and a market that was

89
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,519
completely unstable when you have a

90
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,439
market that's unstable the thing is is

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,959
going from the traditional Market the

92
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,079
medical Market which I feel was much

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,598
more stable we had better product that

94
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,560
was fresher and then it was the first

95
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,199
person to get in or the first people to

96
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,719
get into the wreck were the people that

97
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,518
had the most money not the people with

98
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,560
the best quality not the people who

99
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,438
understood quality

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,640
and sometimes people scaled too quickly

101
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,759
they had quality and so what's on the

102
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,759
shelves is [ __ ] product right

103
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,840
unfortunately and so it's slowly

104
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:46,039
correcting I see good product on the

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,640
shelves sometimes I see good brands with

106
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,959
good product and their product is bad

107
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,598
because it sits on the shelf for too

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,719
long that happens a lot yeah it's a real

109
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,719
problem in Canada going from once it's

110
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,158
finished to getting it on the shelves

111
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,318
like having the skew um you have to have

112
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,639
it registered and and some it's only

113
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,598
supposed to only take a month or two and

114
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,919
I've seen it take up to four months so

115
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:07,238
if you have a product that doesn't have

116
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,598
it it's like you have to wait for this

117
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,640
registration I've seen a lot of times

118
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:11,878
that taking six months to have finished

119
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,719
product to actually get it on the

120
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,839
shelves and it's like I know some people

121
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:19,000
like doing a six-month care but not for

122
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,039
me like I like it when it's still sticky

123
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,839
like it burns everything is snapping but

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
sticky I like that flavor like ex I like

125
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,879
it fresh yeah I like you know and it has

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,478
like a six week window of when it like

127
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,639
it's only going to go downhill after

128
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,199
that six weeks where you know

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
we have products like TPL loock which

130
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,319
help you know and storing it in cold

131
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,679
temperatures help uh but nothing beats a

132
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,439
fresh sticky Pro especially if you get

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,478
that sticky where it's not like sticky

134
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,519
from it being wet but sticky from resin

135
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,279
exactly every stem will snap but the

136
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,359
whole half pound sticks together like

137
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,918
that's my trademark for any half pound

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,199
that I've grown you can pick it up it's

139
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,399
almost hard to roll joints with it but

140
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,000
it rolls in a perfect yeah it looks like

141
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,560
you've been trimming after you've rolled

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,360
one joint and your hands are all [ __ ]

143
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,160
up butt where you can't even really use

144
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,120
the ERS yeah yeah that's that's my style

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
too if I am going to be smoking for sure

146
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,879
so you have a lighting company yes yes

147
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,360
so I've been in the lighting business I

148
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:13,038
was with another company for four and a

149
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,240
half years and then um I branched off on

150
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,680
my own nice wasn't kind of planned it

151
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,759
was kind of I kind of got thrown out um

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
thrown out to to dry basically right but

153
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,240
uh it was for the better or else

154
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,000
Grandmaster LEDs would have never

155
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,600
started so yeah I mean it's funny how

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,279
that works out sometimes the things that

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,000
at the at the time in the moment they

158
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,839
seem like these terrible things and it

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,600
it ends up being a blessing in disguise

160
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,478
well I'd stayed my whole life Anonymous

161
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,400
too so I've been on YouTube for like

162
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,918
years making videos I had to remove

163
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,399
hundreds of videos when they were doing

164
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,560
The Purge but I've always stayed

165
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,359
Anonymous until when I broke left that

166
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,800
company they doxed me on this roll it up

167
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,240
Forum so now like I've been public ever

168
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,918
since then wow yeah nice yeah you're

169
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,720
extremely public I see your Instagram

170
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,439
that's that's actually how we connected

171
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,280
was through Instagram yes and you are

172
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,079
very

173
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,719
opinionated uh like our friend Alex

174
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,519
Miami mango I feel like you guys are

175
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
think unprofessional is a better

176
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,439
unprofessional ter that's a great term

177
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,879
but yeah I mean I feel like you guys

178
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:12,439
speak your mind you're not afraid to

179
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,839
speak your mind and uh you know the the

180
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,759
world needs people like that that are

181
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,918
you know willing to argue and stand up

182
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,439
I'm not one of those people who likes to

183
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,159
argue I just rather not argue about

184
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,439
stuff I just put my content out there

185
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,520
but I love the fact that you guys do it

186
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,918
yeah know I can I totally understand

187
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,758
like I could have probably taken my

188
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,839
career a lot further by just keep keep

189
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,919
my moue shut and saying hi to everybody

190
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,959
and even if I saw something that doesn't

191
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,478
isn't right keeping my moue shut like

192
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,598
for example like just this week I bought

193
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,639
another competitor's light because

194
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:44,719
something didn't smell right and what I

195
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,280
I sent it to light laboratory in

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,440
California here and they're pretty much

197
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,000
the most reputable spear testing place

198
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,839
and then it's like all of a sudden I was

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
right you know the efficiency is lower

200
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,679
than what they're saying and like you

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,120
know I I post that kind of stuff and I

202
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,959
guess you could say expose it or if I

203
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,000
see another company just miss leading

204
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,560
people in a really bad way I'll say

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,720
something even you know and sometimes it

206
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,319
is going to cost me customers but at the

207
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,639
same time I think for everybody it cost

208
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,479
me there are people that respect that

209
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,199
I'm willing to do that right and we're

210
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,598
like it's growing at a really fast rate

211
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
um I think anybody that started at the

212
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,079
same time of us it's probably out of

213
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,479
business by now yeah you know what I

214
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,598
mean and we're every single month doing

215
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,359
better well how it comes across to me is

216
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,360
authentic right I feel like I'm

217
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
authentic in my own way and I feel like

218
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
you're doing the same thing you're

219
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,039
authentic in your own way and there's

220
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,198
nothing wrong with exposing people for

221
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,918
[ __ ] right absolutely this whole

222
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,960
industry there's a lot of [ __ ] that

223
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,399
goes on within the industry Within

224
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,279
products within testing and all these

225
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,359
things I think they need to change so

226
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,119
many white papers have been faked and

227
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,280
like uh I really believe video evidence

228
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,038
is better like like when you can see it

229
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,519
firsthand like so many times everything

230
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,240
has been faked and it's like we've been

231
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,240
LED down these wrong paths because of it

232
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,639
and like anytime where I see a study

233
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,918
that's been done in the later 2000s and

234
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,360
it doesn't have video with it are

235
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,878
pictures I always have to question it

236
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,199
because why couldn't you be snapping

237
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
pictures and showing what you're

238
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,639
describing but only putting it in words

239
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,959
right you know and like um well just

240
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,240
even with some of the stuff we've done

241
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,318
we've discovered other people were

242
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,519
faking their research yeah and it it's

243
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,720
just such a big problem like everything

244
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,038
we do is for the grower like I've been

245
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,560
doing this my whole life so like even

246
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,478
we've designed it when we started we've

247
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,879
designed over 30s something lights and

248
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,680
in the first year I learned some really

249
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,879
big lessons like there was a big

250
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,240
efficiency War originally and we you

251
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,038
know I learned

252
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,719
um diversity is more important than

253
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,120
efficiency and it's like um so we and

254
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,680
same with other things like discovering

255
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,399
far red and having far red into your

256
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,158
lights and seeing the results like we

257
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,158
made lots of mistakes and had to you

258
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,480
know re-register and redesign everything

259
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:47,240
to make it the best um so like I'm not

260
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,879
afraid to make a mistake and admit that

261
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,560
I've done it and then correct it and

262
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,799
kind of move forward right I mean I

263
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,679
think those are the best ways because if

264
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,639
you look at LED in the beginning it

265
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,519
sucked it was [ __ ] terrible 100% it

266
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,360
was awful and it was something I said

267
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,399
I'd never use but I've learned from

268
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,079
experience that I don't use that I'm

269
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,120
never gonna try that again because I

270
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,919
feel like a lot of times we can dial

271
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,480
stuff in we can make it better Spectrum

272
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,799
tuning ex stuff like that I mean we we

273
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,159
use science here and we have Spectrum

274
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,639
tuning and I feel like if you know what

275
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,559
you're doing Spectrum tuning can be

276
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,958
amazing absolutely well to be quite

277
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,559
honest science um is what gave me the

278
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,879
direction that I went with our company

279
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,639
when it went in the Spectrum tuning

280
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,838
because they were the real first company

281
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,039
that had the first concept that had that

282
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,040
we just kind of took it to another level

283
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,480
um to be able to do stuff that their

284
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,360
lights can't do and that you know other

285
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,639
lights can't do and I I think one of the

286
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
biggest things with HPS and led that

287
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:45,519
people don't really realize it's just

288
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,240
like they want L HPS results from an LED

289
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,399
but you know the the spectrum is so much

290
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,519
different like I know a lot of people

291
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,120
try to say oh it's the radiant heat yeah

292
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,919
from it but I I do not agree with that

293
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,679
it is the temperature of the light is so

294
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,439
much different and so it's like the

295
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,838
second um we're seeing people that have

296
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
been using we've developed the very

297
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:04,440
first HPS Spectrum so there's no other

298
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,760
lights that they can mimic a HPS yeah so

299
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,120
like there's a lot of other companies

300
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,600
that have far red in their lights and

301
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,799
they're usually like 2 to 3% at maximum

302
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,079
while at double-ended HPS have 10.4% wow

303
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,000
well ours have the ability to go up to

304
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,879
15% if you really want like they have

305
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,360
the ability to cuz far red can be used

306
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,039
to stretch the plant like I know it's a

307
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,600
re really rare situation but sometimes

308
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,919
like you could have an area or a strain

309
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,959
that you want to catch up with the rest

310
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,479
of the room so you can manipulate it uh

311
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,159
to stretch I think some genetics work

312
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,720
better when you stretch them too as far

313
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,519
as like giving it more node spacing yeah

314
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
you can get chunkier buds that way

315
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,519
absolutely having the ability to also

316
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,439
limit the stretch if you want to by

317
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,320
adding blue is such another huge thing

318
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,760
uh that's another thing that our blue

319
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,720
that we use well it's just kind of a

320
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,120
wider blue wavelength most lights like

321
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,278
science and you could say almost you 98%

322
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,839
of companies have just a 450 nmet blue

323
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,720
Spike where we have a 450 and a 437 and

324
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,720
you get those from using the Samsung Evo

325
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,560
mint diodes and they just um you know

326
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,120
when I was testing them up against each

327
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,479
other we did lots of side by sides like

328
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,679
two spikes versus one and I couldn't see

329
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,000
any type of difference really because

330
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,278
it's the same percentage of blue but um

331
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,440
it just gives you the ability to have

332
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,000
more blue so like anytime when we're

333
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,040
doing lots of different side by sides

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,078
I've seen lots of tests where like when

335
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,039
we only had one to 2% difference it's

336
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,078
literally identical like if there's a 2%

337
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,919
difference in a spectrum you're not

338
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,838
seeing anything but you get up to 10 to

339
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,000
15% and all of a sudden you can really

340
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,000
see some crazy different Expressions you

341
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,679
can have one piece of flower look like

342
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,519
it's from a different planet and it's

343
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,638
the same cut yeah it's amazing yeah

344
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,600
that's you can also completely fluck

345
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,839
your crop up by using uh some you know

346
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,040
by tuning it incorrectly by adding too

347
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,200
much of this or too much of that or

348
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,159
playing around if you don't know what

349
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
you're doing and I've seen that happen

350
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,078
before and I'm one of those tinkerers

351
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,959
where I like messing around but I I

352
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,799
gotta my buddy Justin he's really worked

353
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,958
with the science lights and so he knows

354
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,120
the recipe and so I'd listen to him

355
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,759
instead of playing around with it I'm

356
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,360
like like okay this is you could totally

357
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,600
screw things up or like yeah I I worry

358
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,919
about that too and we got a lot of

359
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,759
people after buying them because we have

360
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,919
like 60 preset spectrums you can choose

361
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,078
from and they're like well what do you

362
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,479
use yeah and I I try to tell people I

363
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,879
don't even actually pay attention to the

364
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,440
different set spectrums I just kind of

365
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,439
think is warm white almost as a HPS and

366
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
cool white is a metal highlight right

367
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,480
and then you can you know you can add

368
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
the other Reds in I'm not the biggest

369
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
fan like a lot of companies have gone in

370
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,759
this direction where they have this big

371
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,879
red Spike it's 660 NM it's a 660 Peak

372
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,399
and a lot of companies use like over

373
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,720
double the amount that they should be

374
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,480
using and it's strictly to get a higher

375
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,879
efficacy number to like look more

376
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,120
efficient on paper it's not for the

377
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,600
plant it's like they're doing it and

378
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,159
specifically yeah and what happens is

379
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,120
when you add that extra red it actually

380
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,319
suppresses green that's like really

381
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,879
important I think that's pretty

382
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,160
essential um when you look at HPS like a

383
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,639
double-ended HPS it roughly has about

384
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,559
almost I think it's like around 58% red

385
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,360
and around like 38%

386
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,439
um green and then the rest I think it's

387
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,000
like four to 5% blue they just don't

388
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,959
have nearly as much I really think it's

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,198
just the wrong route like if you look at

390
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,638
um an actual double-ended HPS you'll see

391
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,319
that like it goes from 600 to about 630

392
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,278
is where you see it you don't doesn't

393
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,920
even really have any 660 if it does it's

394
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,360
just at the very bottom right and like I

395
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,679
I've just seen people having better

396
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,159
results with the Fuller Spectrum um I

397
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,679
had a crop where I did three different

398
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:28,278
spectrums with a cut where I've got over

399
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,399
a hundred runs in with it it's called

400
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,600
Death Bubba everybody has seen my death

401
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,759
Bubba videos and when I still got three

402
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,079
different results like one of the buds

403
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,360
was almost like 15 to 20% bigger

404
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,838
different triome density different bud

405
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,159
structure it's like as soon as I saw

406
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,320
that I'm like this is the future yeah

407
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,958
100% like everything we're doing moving

408
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,879
forward as Spectrum tuning yeah I agree

409
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,319
yeah I mean it's just another level you

410
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,278
can just take it to a different level

411
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,000
and the more you can tune in your room

412
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,240
the better you know and it's it then you

413
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,360
can get really specific with genetics

414
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,079
and you're like okay well this variety

415
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,399
well under this spectrum and this one

416
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,838
under this and you know it's like that's

417
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,879
the future right well having that test

418
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,680
room with the four lights a bare minimum

419
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,278
two but we um we're working with this

420
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,638
company in Missouri that they have a

421
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:13,838
test room with four different ones they

422
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,680
put curtains in between it and they make

423
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,399
it like totally different and man

424
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,879
they're really seeing a a big

425
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,679
Competitive Edge because whichever one

426
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,600
does the best then they Implement that

427
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,958
as their base Spectrum but then they can

428
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,480
also use it like with adding blues and

429
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,879
different stuff to manipulate it but

430
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,879
know what base Spectrum it's going to

431
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,720
work the best and most people have one

432
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:34,320
Spectrum right so they're like you know

433
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,639
it's such a Competitive Edge to have oh

434
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,560
yeah and it's a beautiful thing like as

435
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,639
a breeder now coming in now you're

436
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,078
breeding these things and you're

437
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,198
starting to understand how the Spectrum

438
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,120
works with the genetics that you're

439
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,078
breeding and then right out the gate you

440
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,480
can kind of get a good understanding of

441
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,758
what's going to work well with what and

442
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,600
yeah especially for your own crew or

443
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,680
like coming up with your own proprietary

444
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,399
light recipes that you can license out

445
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,120
for those different genetics because

446
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
like what's when everybody's using the

447
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,560
same spectrum and the same genetics and

448
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,120
the same food

449
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,439
it's like you really need to give

450
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,159
something that's

451
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,440
that have an edge yeah I mean it's it's

452
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,039
really interesting the direction the

453
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,240
world is going in it's like right when

454
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,000
you think they figured it all out boom

455
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,480
we got this this isn't even the tip of

456
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,919
the iceberg yet you know I feel like

457
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,839
there's so much more you know with

458
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,439
nutrition with everything else and

459
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
everybody there's a handful of companies

460
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,800
that make good product as far as

461
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,800
nutrition is concerned absolutely but uh

462
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,159
it's like we're still dialing it in so

463
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,838
dialing in yields under canopy inner

464
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,480
canopy all this stuffff yeah we've been

465
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,360
working on we're we're probably about a

466
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,360
month from releasing their under canopy

467
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
we we ran into a little hiccup like I

468
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,199
had everything ready to go and then I

469
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,159
well ARS isn't just under canopy it's

470
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,359
Lower Side lighting too and upper side

471
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,879
if you want and I what I didn't I

472
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,079
overlooked is the different distance and

473
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,639
trellis bars between different tables

474
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,198
yeah and because you know they there

475
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,959
could be anywhere from four feet five

476
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,679
feet six feet or even more and we had to

477
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,119
you know come up with a waai to make the

478
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,559
lights Mount to those bars so I like I

479
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,078
same with our under canopy they kind of

480
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,919
they float they don't sit on different

481
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,198
structures so oh wow yeah we actually

482
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,719
have a Utility Patent for it actually

483
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,039
yeah I'm excited for all this under

484
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,199
canopy and inner canopy and side

485
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,000
lighting I think that it's it's really

486
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:15,719
cool and I think you know some of these

487
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,720
guys are like ah you don't need that if

488
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,639
you have the proper light at the proper

489
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,759
distance you're going to get the

490
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,440
penetration and I have yet to see that

491
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,039
and and you we're working with faven

492
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,319
we've done some faven trials and yeah

493
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,439
I'm excited for the stuff that uh we're

494
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:30,679
doing now and it's like the poten so

495
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
huge for that and same thing with

496
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,479
breeding right so if you make seeds

497
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,198
you're doing seed production oh You' get

498
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,440
so much more underneath all those all

499
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,679
those white yellow seeds those now I

500
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,519
didn't even think of that that's dud

501
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,799
it's a game changer and so we're

502
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,879
actually I'm actually trying in my seed

503
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,278
production room we're going to be able

504
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,639
to tell you whether it's the under

505
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,838
canopy the Light Lift or the combination

506
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,879
of the Light Lift with the under canopy

507
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,720
that yields the most seeds so I'm I'm

508
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,198
very confident that one of those if not

509
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,879
all of them are going to be extremely

510
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,159
beneficial I I think it yeah it's going

511
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,799
to play a huge Factor well just having I

512
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,959
like I really recommend people if they

513
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,000
can to build a light lifting system I

514
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,038
even have a DIY video that shows how to

515
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,880
do it with pulley and using a winch

516
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,679
system if you can't don't want to buy

517
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,919
like a I know think growed has an option

518
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
for doing it and there's a few different

519
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,079
options we got a horizon light but yeah

520
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,360
think has a cool one we got the hor nice

521
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:26,159
like well even so even going back for my

522
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,198
whole commercial growing career yeah um

523
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,360
going back to almost the earliest days

524
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,519
well after about 2004 we would always

525
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,240
have like I'd build it on a crank system

526
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,160
yeah so you can always lift like I was I

527
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,519
was never a double-ended HPS I was a

528
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,240
single-ended HPS guy I went from I hate

529
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,160
yo-yos I absolutely hate I went from

530
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,960
that to then like I went and got into

531
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,919
LED lighting and like um so yeah my

532
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,558
experience like I didn't ever get like

533
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,960
the most to be quite honest that I ever

534
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,918
yielded on a single ended HPS was 2.85

535
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,360
pounds per light like with a a cush

536
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,240
strain and that's still really really

537
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:03,798
good I did many times between 2.5 and

538
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,240
2.65 and you know went for half a decade

539
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:07,918
over averaging over two when that was

540
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,038
way above the average back then like

541
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,559
breaking two was a big deal 1.5 was the

542
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,480
average just so you guys know back in

543
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,639
the day if you hit 1.5 you know 15 years

544
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,798
ago that was it like you were you were

545
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,559
killing it and then sour and blue dream

546
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,679
they would get around two maybe 2.2 like

547
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,240
the first time I hit 2.2 was with sour

548
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,960
did you ever grow Juicy Fruit like we

549
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,759
were I was growing juicy fruit from like

550
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,120
about 98 to about 2002 and I know that

551
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,839
majority of it all came to here too did

552
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,879
we saw that juicy for here it was such

553
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,558
like that was the really good stuff that

554
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,520
came from Canada I believe was Juicy

555
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,359
Fruit but uh we had a lot of the beers

556
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,440
that W weren't so great that you know

557
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,119
it's like they were all footballs

558
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,519
football pounds that were like that big

559
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,239
where they had smashed them in and I

560
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,319
think they ran 03 to kill the smell oh

561
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,798
yeah there were just so many so much

562
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,839
crazy stuff that we used to see but yeah

563
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,240
it was such a popular one for years I

564
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:00,119
don't know if you guys ever had the old

565
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,759
school plant that was like from the '90s

566
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,918
to the early 2000s that's gone now yeah

567
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,200
I mean we we've had some hash plants

568
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,400
I've seen a couple different varieties

569
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,120
of hash plant coming down so some uh

570
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,200
like AFU was also a hash plant yeah like

571
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,399
I this would have been I I don't like I

572
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,440
would have made it at some point but it

573
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,600
would have been in the late 90s it

574
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,919
wouldn't have been that popular but it

575
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,359
was like a biker strain like and it was

576
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,320
it was just a super killer strain I've

577
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,240
been searching for it forever like just

578
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,639
to get it back and with no luck tried

579
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,240
well people have given it to said hey

580
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,880
I've got a cut of it but holding on to

581
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,079
it for two decades and every time I grow

582
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,760
it it's not even close that happens all

583
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,199
the time I mean I think that that's the

584
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,679
same thing with cat piss there's a lot

585
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,480
of people that say they have cat piss

586
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,640
but it's like it's not the cat piss that

587
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,159
I remember oh man I sure remember a lot

588
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,679
of cat piss strains yeah we also there

589
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,400
was a strain called Master Kush I don't

590
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,600
like I don't even know if that's what

591
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,759
the real n uh strain I used to Mono it

592
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:56,399
with death Bubba um it had the highest

593
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:58,759
thcv that we' ever seen by far W like it

594
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,559
got almost 7% it was just under 7% it

595
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,720
more than anything we'd ever seen and I

596
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,759
was one of them I grew it um up until

597
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,558
the point where death Bubba was yielding

598
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,119
more for me and I was getting the same

599
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,558
money for him and then I dropped it and

600
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,719
then I I got it years later about four

601
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,960
years ago guy gives me four cuts and

602
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,079
says if this is it for sure well out of

603
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,919
the four Cuts one of them was the real

604
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,639
cut one of them was a cross and one of

605
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,480
them was like this other PK strain that

606
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,720
I absolutely hate and it was just

607
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,519
incredible so after I got it grew it out

608
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,919
I somehow managed to mark it wrong

609
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,319
so like or somehow like the person I was

610
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,080
working with didn't mark it correctly it

611
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,000
wasn't me personally so I had to grow

612
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:40,720
out again and then on the next crop as

613
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
soon as it was done somehow my buddy

614
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,960
must have while he was walking out of

615
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,679
the room swapped the Clones so I threw

616
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,038
out like this is after I lost it I the

617
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,200
other one was across of it though I was

618
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:53,400
like the S like it grew small buds and

619
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,840
had the smell that was different but

620
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,600
anyway so I threw it out sent it to like

621
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,240
five different people across Canada to

622
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,519
like secure it for me me then they

623
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,079
started growing it out and the strain

624
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,440
didn't like light like it couldn't take

625
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,158
very much light and all of a sudden I

626
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
was like I just couldn't believe that I

627
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,039
got it back and then threw it lost it

628
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,440
never will I let some I'll let someone

629
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,960
else deal with it I'll deal with it

630
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,798
myself right or trust someone I've lost

631
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
so many different things that I really

632
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,879
loved over the years you know there's

633
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,480
been so many great things that we didn't

634
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,760
have tissue culture back then we didn't

635
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,599
have big places to keep our stuff alive

636
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,879
and we shared it with the wrong person

637
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,918
and they lost it oh yeah I mean I used

638
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
to bring stuff up to Washington just so

639
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,679
they could secure it for me so I could

640
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,200
go back at I lost sard isil like maybe

641
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,679
six times and had to go to Washington

642
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,400
six different times to get it back nice

643
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,360
that in the cam we had the cam that's

644
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,159

647
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,919

648
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,439

649
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,880

652
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,079
with sour it's like I have not seen the

653
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,320
most amazing sour like it used to be on

654
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,240
average we used to see a lot of good

655
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,599
sour where it you open the bag it

656
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,159
punches you in the face it's so loud it

657
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,599
just you know and the buds were so

658
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,159
sticky and I mean the outdoor was nuts

659
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,038
too like the outdoor was just as good as

660
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,559
the indoor yeah your guys's outdoor

661
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:20,278
Market it's well like it's so different

662
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,440
than how ours well we don't have an

663
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:23,599
outdoor Market we never have like no

664
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,919
like I'm not saying that people didn't

665
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,000
grow but it never affected our markets

666
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,759
what was so crazy for um a I'm going to

667
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,960
say up until potentially

668
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:36,079
2014 I would watch every single year at

669
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,519
the end of August September the prices

670
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,599
of indor with Skyrocket yeah it happened

671
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,440
for I watched it for about 15 years in a

672
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,359
row and then finally I remember talking

673
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,759
to my buddy just a few years before the

674
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:49,918
15 years be like hey man you could just

675
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:51,640
make a career buying stuff at cheap and

676
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,919
selling it you know months later when

677
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,840
it's like careers and retirements have

678
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,038
been made on that for sure D out there I

679
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,599
mean that's that's it like you

680
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,278
if you have the if you have the funds

681
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,319
the capital to do that I mean there's

682
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:06,440
been people throughout the last 20 years

683
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,079
that they Brokers that didn't even grow

684
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,000
it they can go buy for dirt cheap hold

685
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,000
on to it for four months put it in some

686
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,720
cold storage and then unload it for two

687
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,960
three four or five times as much as they

688
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,919
paid for it yeah it's insane so the

689
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,440
first year that I tried it buying 50

690
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,679
pounds was the first year there was a

691
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,120
gap in the market where we hit Uncharted

692
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,038
Territory well it's funny cuz I think I

693
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,239
had gotten it for like 17 and you know

694
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:31,919
at 24 was the peak like we're used to we

695
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,599
were used to seeing at least go up to 28

696
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,120
to 29 every single year and then it went

697
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,798
down to 24 and then you know I still did

698
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,278
all right with it but I it was the very

699
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,400
first year and then it's like we got in

700
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:44,119
Uncharted Territory ever since that

701
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,600
point on and like we've just seen well

702
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,319
like for our outdoor it's just so

703
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,558
different we don't have like that

704
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:50,918
outdoor crop it's we don't I've in my

705
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,798
whole life I've ever seen anything I've

706
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,038
never seen it flooded with outdoor packs

707
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,519
like no one's interested like that

708
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:57,440
doesn't we're like a hub where

709
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,879
everything is going out you know what I

710
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,038
mean from all over the place so for sure

711
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,960
yeah well now Canada is exporting all

712
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:06,400
over the world I heard I've got like a

713
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,798
good friend of mine that exports about

714
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,519
three to 5,000 pounds a month and it's

715
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,200
he's all over the place you name it he's

716
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:14,879
in like 16 he even he was the first

717
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,278
person to export to Jamaica and I don't

718
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,080
know why they're exporting but one of my

719
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,880
a guy that I dealt with for years set up

720
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,519
a chain of dispensaries across there

721
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,240
yeah called the canic clinics but nice

722
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,759
but uh yeah it's just insane um like I I

723
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,159
think there's still people that do it on

724
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,200
the black market that bring it to the

725
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,480
states just because of the Gap in our

726
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
pricing I know it sounds crazy but

727
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,120
there's people that will take it from

728
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,480
the West Coast that bring it to the east

729
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,678
coast and going across to the states

730
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,240
it's just well like it right now like if

731
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,759
you know you can get really nice stuff

732
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,200
for like say 500 Canadian a pound I

733
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,798
probably wouldn't even recognize it

734
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,880
because I think when I think of Canadian

735
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,599
I think of this super dense stuff that

736
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
like doesn't have you know what I mean

737
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:56,158
so probably if he comes down here they

738
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,360
don't call it Canadian they just call

739
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,399
you wouldn't have a clue you'd be

740
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,278
surprised on like uh just how horrible

741
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,439
our Market is like I I can remember a

742
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,159
while ago couple years ago one of my

743
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,880
buddies was bugging me like crazy he's

744
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,039
like I know you can help me so I phoned

745
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,360

746
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,798

748
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,720
not involved in anything like that but I

749
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,159
was I happened to go by the store and I

750
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,720

751
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,520
ever seen in my life not one small piece

752
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,480

a joint driving across the border I only

784
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,918
had a joint in the car but it was in a

785
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,240
tackle box and they decided to search

786
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,038
the car and I was so upset that they

787
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,759
were searching the car I talked [ __ ]

788
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,960
because I didn't think there was

789
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,038
anything in the car and so the whole

790
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,440
time the guyyy searching I'm like you

tackle box in the trunk that had like a

795
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,599

00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,158
I'm that's a joint and it's it's

805
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
medicine it wasn't even mine that's the

806
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,039
funny thing but I did have a script on

807
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,678
me and so I ended up having to pay a

808
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:16,759
$550 fine and got kicked out of the

809
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,720
country for five years okay when was

810
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,879
that what year was that a long time ago

811
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,759
that was

812
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:29,080
200 S maybe six so I'm okay I mean I got

813
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,000
a felony but we'll see nice renthal he's

814
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,839
he goes across he seems to be okay doing

815
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,558
going over there yeah I you know what I

816
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:36,240
think they're you know they're going to

817
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,599
let you like if you broke somebody's

818
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,159
face with their legs I think that you

819
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,759
have a better chance of getting across

820
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,039
than if you're selling or got caught

821
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,960
with like a trafficking charge or

822
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:46,798
something yeah like something like that

823
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,399
they just hate that [ __ ] right or I'm

824
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,440
sure stolen property too probably

825
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,319
doesn't go over doesn't fly very well

826
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,720
anything like that but DUI I think if

827
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,000
you have a DUI you can't even get in

828
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,480
Canada but the United States stupid

829
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,640
silly yeah well it's just especially I

830
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,440
don't know how they well 24 I don't know

831
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,399
like they have a 24-hour here that's

832
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,640
like a step down from a DUI or is there

833
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:11,759
is it only DUI only DUI yeah for us you

834
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,759
can get like a 24hour where it's like uh

835
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,278
you just lose your license for 24 hours

836
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,919
and you get it back or whatever they

837
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,278
need to do that here that's a that's a

838
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,840
good one yeah like I I I you know I've

839
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,519
got I've got them for [ __ ] when I

840
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,199
wasn't even on anything and the only

841
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,000
shitty thing about it is I can't dispute

842
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,919
it or anything and like if for weed like

843
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,359
it's happened to me like remember uh get

844
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,960
going for a drive to pick something up

845
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,959
from the store and like my ride smelling

846
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,640
like it and I got taken down and I'm

847
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,399
arrested for 24 hours I remember like I

848
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,038
was just picking something up from the

849
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,678
store my wife is like where are you yeah

850
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,679
like uh so yeah it's pretty crazy wow

851
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,640
but yeah so I mean they do need that

852
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,159
here if it's you know a DUI I guess it's

853
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,720
a pretty serious charger you can well

854
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:51,799
it's big money right and so at the end

855
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,038
of the day they're not going to change

856
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,639
it because they like the money that they

857
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,879
get from the DUIs I think it's you know

858
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,399
and and 08 is the percentage oh so you

859
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,640
are allowed some you can have up to 08

860
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:06,479
in your system and then anything over

861
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,278
that you go you pretty much go to jail

862
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,360
pretty sure Canada it's zero tolerance

863
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,000
now at this point zero tolerance for

864
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,558
driving yeah I'm pretty sure it's like

865
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,640
you're not allowed anything anymore wow

866
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,319
yeah you guys are drinkers too a lot

867
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,559
most of the Canadians actually Dave not

868
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,278
a drinker bubble man's not really a

869
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:24,158
drinker yeah no no definitely not bubble

870
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:27,558
man like I don't like I when I drink I'm

871
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,559
not a quitter yeah so like I I drink but

872
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,359
like I only maybe have drinks maybe one

873
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:34,359
or two times a year it's not not a very

874
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:36,918
you ever see the movie Strange Brew not

875
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,199

876
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,679
name sounds familiar but it's not

877
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,399
ringing a bell what's that was like my

878
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,038
first experience with Canadians in beer

879
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:46,278
but it was so long ago but I remember

880
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,558
the the a they said a a lot yeah no I

881
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:50,240
spent my 20s doing a lot of drinking

882
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,398
yeah a lot of club scene and stuff and

883
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,720

the Edibles is actually

887
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,600
nice yeah I'm not big on the Edibles I

888
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:06,319
smoke joints uh Edibles just don't sit

889
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:09,278
well with me I mean the thing is is like

890
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:12,398
I'll do the the micro do weed edibles

891

yeah I do the mushrooms too I like the

894
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,278
mushroom micro does too um but like

895
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,559
mushrooms I can handle more than I can

896
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,720
handle Edibles for whatever reason but I

897
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,678
can smoke a big fat joint and be totally

898
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,399
happy it man if you don't have a

899
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,120
tolerance like even for me I just quit

900
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,759
for a while and then took it and it's

901
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,839
like I was getting way too [ __ ] high

902
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,079

905
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,000

they phone straight up 911 and got an

911
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,679
ambulance there cuz they think they're

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,038
having a heart attack this one guy I

913
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,360
gave it to like I have these gel caps

914
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,919
that are like 3 50 milligram yeah I gave

915
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,678
one to him and I took it he fell asleep

916
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,159
woke up forgot he took it and he's just

917
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,480
thinks something was going on with this

918
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,399
hard paramedics and everything come down

919
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,278
there they're like no any [ __ ] drugs

920
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,558
he's like uh oh [ __ ] yeah I took it but

921
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:17,960
I've seen a few people where this

922
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,638
happens to if you take too much it's

923
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,038
just not fun I mean I've curled up in

924
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:24,278
the bed before I wanted to go to the

925
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:27,119
hospital for sure yeah but uh yeah well

926
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,200
here so in wreck you're limited to 10

927
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,000
milligram doses and 100 milligrams per

928
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
package that's what I've been seeing

929
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,599
I've been buying them I've been eating

930
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,080
like a few hundred at night time just

931
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,678
yeah yeah do you know what it's better

932
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,960
than Canada I think in Canada we have

933
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,679
five I've never even truly been in a

934
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,079
legal dispensary in Canada never really

935
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,798
never like it well there I personally

936
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:49,519
it's just not my thing there'd be

937
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,119
nothing for me to there and right and

938
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,159
well first of all the Edibles are just

939
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,959
like baby baby doses too right totally

940
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,600
five milligrams but you got to eat a lot

941
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,440
yeah like kind I don't like having to

942
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:02,199
suck on a bunch of sugar or eat a bunch

943
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,639
of sugar either if I'm going to like

944
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,759
once in a while but I don't want to be

945
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:07,798
eating a bunch of sugar every single

946
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,960
night so I always have them in gel caps

947
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,960
yeah yeah that's the way to go for sure

948
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,960
MCT oil yeah definitely good stuff I

949
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,519
like making like high-end rosin that

950
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,399
people would be smoking and using it for

951
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,720
Edibles I think rosin's the best for

952
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:23,558
Edibles yeah I think absolutely well

953
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,000
like I normally was making it from flour

954
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,200
and just recently like I I I'm just

955
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,599
getting into water hash cuz of bubble

956
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,240
and like I'm making it all and a man the

957
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,959
difference in potency is so [ __ ] kick

958
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,919
you it's so much different like same

959
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,038
milligram but it's way more but but so I

960
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,399
like the the gummies that are made from

961
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,319
rosin yeah oh definitely like anything

962
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,000
that's made from Rosen like I for

963
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,839
whatever reason I would always notice

964
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,599
that when if you have Edibles that were

965
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:54,240
made from BHO yeah after I would you get

966
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,480
like these nasty burps totally from like

967
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,839
the taste of it like and you know when

968
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,240
people are making distillate that stuff

969
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,038
there's like some pretty stinky stuff

970
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,440
that comes out of it some of the crude

971
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,398
yeah I forget what they call my buddy

972
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,440
nicknamed it the fish stuff but that

973
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,239
gross stuff yeah is like uh what you're

974
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,679
burp it's that that you're burping that

975
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,240
stuff like

976
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:14,679
it's yeah when I when I take it from

977
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,120
rosin I don't have those burps at all

978
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,320
it's completely gone you don't so it's

979
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,918
like um it filters that out when from

980
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,240
the Heat or whatever the lipids or

981
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,559
whatever the fats aren't in it it's like

982
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,200
the hot dog water in the carts yeah yeah

983
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,240
that's nasty uh but yeah I like I like

984
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,519
the Rosen yies rosin Tech makes these

985
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,558
amazing ones I don't remember the

986
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,240
flavors but they had some like I feel

987
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,599
like you get the the taste of the rosin

988
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,960
is also good you get the chirps yeah and

989
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,879
it's complimentary a lot of times

990
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,558
especially with sweet stuff yeah I was

991
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,278
noticing like it's the pricing here like

992
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:48,079
on well the stuff for 20 bucks for 100

993
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,880
milligrams with really tasty really nice

994
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,960
high-end gummies though stuff for $10

995
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm surprised it's not that bad but you

996
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,200
can definitely taste taste taste the

997
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,480
difference well taste the difference in

998
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,000
it I'm thinking in my head why did I buy

999
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,558
the cheap [ __ ] I well first of all I

1000
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,880
don't want any cheap [ __ ] there's a

1001
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:05,759
reason why they're selling it [ __ ] so

1002
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,600
cheap and I like I I know that you guys

1003
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,599
are it's I think it's from what my

1004
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,759
understanding it's like the wild west

1005
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,280
for your guys's dispensary like

1006
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,720
pesticide testing and stuff like in

1007
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,919
Canada it's so like everything is tested

1008
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,678
so thoroughly there's no way you're

1009
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:20,118
walking into a dispensary and getting

1010
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,240
stuff with pesticides like it could

1011
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,800
happen I would say here it's the same

1012
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,199
way too I mean there's some people that

1013
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,240
have circumvented and cheated and got

1014
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,439
gone around it but like in the

1015
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,319
dispensary

1016
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,800
in

1017
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,000
California I can't speak for every state

1018
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,919
but I would say that it it's pretty

1019
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,358
heavily tested and they're coming down

1020
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,759
on the labs that are you know oh really

1021
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:41,759
oh yeah because like I I I kind of

1022
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,320
thought it was still kind of like the

1023
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,720
wild west with the dispensaries like up

1024
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,720
until like Canada be there used to be

1025
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,358
like in downtown Vancouver like over a

1026
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,838
hundred like black market dispensaries

1027
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:54,159
they were accepted by the police they're

1028
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,799
paying you know licenses but then every

1029
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,000
single one got wiped out like they were

1030
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,519
completely gone and there's no more

1031
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,559
black market dispensaries it's only

1032
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,358
legal dispens New York has the Bas right

1033
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,159
so like you can do in New York but

1034
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,719
California doesn't have the BEDA model

1035
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:11,879
really but we have thca and so thca you

1036
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:15,639
can find that in gas gas stations liquor

1037
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,480
stores uh CBD shops and it's thca flower

1038
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:21,319
that's grown under hemp license a lot of

1039
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,039
times and you know so these guys are

1040
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,760
there's just loophole right now it's

1041
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,400
going to get sealed up but I've been

1042
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,359
hearing about it yeah I didn't fully

1043
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,039
understand it like say Ser wild yeah

1044
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:32,880
like cuz like I remember I was speaking

1045
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,559
to this guy in Colorado that was like he

1046
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,320
was so happy because he was allowed to

1047
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,880
like sell thca now yeah to some other

1048
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,800
state he's like my bank just accepted me

1049
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,838
like he was all excited about it yeah

1050
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,599
because I guess that's well I already

1051
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,719
know it's the issue here like I like I'm

1052
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,079
with Chase and I I had an issue like

1053
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:52,480
when we got paid by a cannabis company

1054
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,119
like I we can't even be paid by from

1055
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,199
Chase yeah I don't like Chase Chase is

1056
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,920
the worst is are they yeah I can't even

1057
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,838
have an account there they they blocked

1058
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,760
me from having an account but oh yeah

1059
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,960
but yeah like in cannabis like Chase is

1060
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,920
Chase is not cool with any of it uh thca

1061
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,039
is considered hemp under the farm bill

1062
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,920
that was passed it falls under the

1063
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:15,639
category unless it it's converted to a

1064
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,440
Delta 9 then that would be considered

1065
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:21,440
THC but it has to be above. 3% so you

1066
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:26,480
could have Delta 9 at 0.

1067
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,240
2% uh and it could have 27% thca and

1068
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,639
it's considered hemp you you smoke it it

1069
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:33,519
still gets you high still tastes amazing

1070
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,719
still that same plant but it's it's it's

1071
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,199
categorized

1072
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,000
differently wild yeah yeah we're in an

1073
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,039
interesting I mean you know this is an

1074
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,719
interesting day in time that's evolving

1075
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,599
and it's not going to stay this way

1076
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,199
forever things are changing I I still

1077
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,280
think though like with all the damn red

1078
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,679
States like it's got to be so thriving

1079
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,560
there's got to be so many people just

1080
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,719
crushing it that's all like dude the

1081
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,078
thca people are people that are selling

1082
00:36:54,719 --> 00:37:00,199
you working under the hemp are crushing

1083
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:04,240
it and Texas because Texas isn't legal

1084
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:05,559
for cannabis it's it's not it's not it's

1085
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,118
recreational who knows if it'll ever

someday but it's not right now but thca

1088

media you've been on YouTube for a long

1101
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:40,199
time yeah so I was on I had hundreds of

1102
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,879
videos on YouTube so I at any given time

1103
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,039
I would be documenting anywhere from

1104
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,800
like two to six to seven operations so

1105
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:50,480
like I was a commercial well commercial

1106
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,359
sized medical gross for a long time like

1107
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,358
for about 15 years where I would have

1108
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:57,000
anywhere from I don't know 150 to 500

1109
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,039
lights going really depending on what's

1110
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,559
going on so I used to yeah I used to

1111
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,920
make like um in some weeks I would put

1112
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:05,559
out 10 videos like I I literally did it

1113
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,720
besides the growing it was almost full

1114
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,759
time where I'm like I'd have crops where

1115
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,039
I would have over 50 videos out just for

1116
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,440
one crop where each video is anywhere

1117
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,119
from you know five to 20 minutes where

1118
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,679
I'm covering every last part of it um

1119
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,200
and it you know it was like a passion

1120
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,279
for me I just and I helped a lot of

1121
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,919
different people all over the world with

1122
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,480
it and then they had this YouTube Purge

1123
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,680
I don't know if you ever remember about

1124
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,559
it where it's like all of a sudden

1125
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,639
YouTube channel half of everybody I knew

1126
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,000
was taken out and so at that point we

1127
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,719
were like I I removed like I had over

1128
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,960
700 grow videos and like a couple

1129
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:38,719
hundred live streams I removed

1130
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,679
everything and I opened up a zoom

1131
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,279
account and we started taking everything

1132
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,519
to zoom you know we have like at one

1133
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,040
point it was like a 500 to 600 person

1134
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,880
live audience we had built up every

1135
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,239
single week soon as we went to zoom we

1136
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,720
were down to like 200 we did that for

1137
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,519
like about a year and then I felt

1138
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,838
YouTube like some channels were coming

1139
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,920
back and the tide was changing and I

1140
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:00,960
just felt like I came back to YouTube

1141
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,200
and then um obviously the algorithms

1142
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,920
changed like it used to be well and it

1143
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,559
keeps changing I feel like the one thing

1144
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,838
now that's the constant is that it's

1145
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,719
going to keep changing same thing

1146
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,199
Instagram it's constantly changing sucks

1147
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,639
you can never catch up to it because

1148
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,480
it's constantly changing it's so

1149
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,078
complicated and they use so many data

1150
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,920
points uh that they're they're pulling

1151
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,119
from and there's so many qualifications

1152
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,358
for videos and they use AI so if there's

1153
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,960
a weed leaf on your shirt you're not

1154
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,639
going to get subscribers you're not

1155
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,119
going to get viewers on on any of the

1156
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:34,440
platforms except for maybe Twitter

1157
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,400
Twitter's been more open about that yeah

1158
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,960
but Twitter doesn't have the same for me

1159
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,000
Twitter doesn't have the same results as

1160
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,599
Instagram or YouTube yeah like at at one

1161
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,838
point if you had a title whoever had the

1162
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,960
most views and it's the same title came

1163
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:51,920
to the top that was like the ultimate

1164
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,039
and um X is supposed to be like that

1165
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,838
right but I'm Just a Nobody on X like I

1166
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,199
can't I'm trying to give away a light to

1167
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,679
get over a th followers and it's been a

1168
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,639
month like I haven't been plugging it

1169
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,559
every day but it's like yeah it's so

1170
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,920
hard to get to that point like I'm sure

1171
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,719
if I had 20,000 people I could totally

1172
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,280
grow from that point on but because I'm

1173
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:11,639
being seen by so little it's like yeah

1174
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,720
it's the same thing for like YouTube

1175
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:15,759
like try to start a YouTube channel from

1176
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:18,279
scratch and try to make it it's

1177
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,480
impossible you would need a big break

1178
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,240
yeah you know what I mean like you

1179
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,119
that's what we had we I mean we we grew

1180
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:24,679
we have now 12,000 subscribers and I

1181
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,760
feel like Ricky Palamino when he was

1182
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,960
talking about Snoop Dogg it went viral

1183
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,400
and I think those when you're talking

1184
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,159
about celebrities or popular things

1185
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,480
popular search topics those you know we

1186
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:38,759
got six million views on one short on

1187
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,159
YouTube that's insane yeah yeah it just

1188
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,160
kept growing and I'm like is it gonna

1189
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,480
stop and Ryan is it gonna stop and he's

1190
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,598
like I don't know you think it's gonna

1191
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,480
stop and I'm like I don't know and uh

1192
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,760
you know we went on for eight weeks and

1193
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,599
it just kept growing and growing and

1194
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,640
growing yeah it's just really it's crazy

1195
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,400
and like uh one of the strategies for us

1196
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,239
was like cross um cross crossing traffic

1197
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,880
with other people and

1198
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,919
collaborations like we're actually do

1199
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,280
you know who mercules is with Death Row

1200
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,000
Records he actually pering for Snoop Dog

1201
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,040
right now on their tour that they're

1202
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,679
doing um we're doing a collaboration

1203
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,318
with him and we're making mercs so we're

1204
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,399
making some really pimp ass glasses that

1205
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:14,960
are going to come with our lights and

1206
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,838
he's also going to be selling them what

1207
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,760
is the best Spectrum for Led glasses

1208
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,400
what is the best color well here's the

1209
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,280
thing is uh like there's some companies

1210
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,838
that make them that claim protection but

1211
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,040
I'll tell you you can put it on and it's

1212
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,239
like blinding so we have already have

1213
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,199
our own glasses when you put them on

1214
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,399
it's like a green color but it gives you

1215
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:36,078
almost I'm going to say 99% protection

1216
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,358
like I can turn the lights at full power

1217
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,560
and look at them and I have like actual

1218
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:43,559
protection the only issue is it's like a

1219
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,799
green color but after about five minutes

1220
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,719
it adjusts right so your eyes do adjust

1221
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,920
have green ones too yeah we're we're

1222
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:51,159
we're working on a few we're going to

1223
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,200
have a few different lenses and um but

1224
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,879
we're definitely going to keep on

1225
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:55,159
working on till we have something so

1226
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,400
like we haven't finished our lens but

1227
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:59,159
we've just finished the design of the

1228
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,440
glasses so yeah you need a tunable

1229
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,879
glasses that can tune to the different

1230
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,400
spectrums yeah Auto Tune on the glass

1231
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,920
you just push a button and it Tunes with

1232
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,559
the light yeah yeah being able to the

1233
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,400
eye protection it's I think it's

1234
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,759
something that's overlooked like oh man

1235
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,920
your eyes can oh like after working in

1236
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,880
they trying to work in Far red or like

1237
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,200
too much it's so bad yeah just like when

1238
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,039
you walk out of a room after you've

1239
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,879
doing it like you're so blinded too so

1240
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,318
yeah it's like it's something for the

1241
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,039
it's some people should be paying

1242
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,480
attention to and yeah I mean these are

1243
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,000
the type of things I think about for

1244
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,880
employees like I don't I don't it's not

1245
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,039
even the liability aspect of it it's

1246
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,160
more so that their health and their Eye

1247
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:38,679
Health I'm getting older myself so my

1248
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,039
eyes have gotten worse the second you I

1249
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:43,039
was fine everyone's like when you turn

1250
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:45,318
40 and the truth is is when I turned 43

1251
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:48,480
is when my eyes got [ __ ] I'm 47 now

1252
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:51,639
but like my eyes went to where I needed

1253
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,800
bifocals I didn't get bifocals but um

1254
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:55,679
now I have two different lenses so I

1255
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,640
have one more concentrated that's that's

1256
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,719
for distance than one that's for

1257
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,519
nearsighted I could I could see that

1258
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,719
yeah you have to be it's yeah my I've

1259
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,239
had really good eye vision but I like my

1260
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:09,318
whole life and stuff but I kind of feel

1261
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,039
like they've taken a toll from the years

1262
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:12,800
of the lighting and every like being

1263
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:13,960
around it like crazy well we're in a

1264
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,559
beautiful time too they have lens

1265
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,199
surgery to where they can pull the lens

1266
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,079
off your eye and put a new lens on and

1267
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,759
they be better than 2020 Vision as long

1268
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,200
as your vision's stable yeah so let's

1269
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,760
dive into talking about genetics because

1270
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,598
I know you're a big genetics guy you

1271
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,000
love genetics you love cannabis at least

1272
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,880
from what I get to see yeah um yeah to

1273
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,400
be quite honest like I I'm all the stuff

1274
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,880
majority of the stuff I have is really

1275
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,880
old school well like old school OG

1276
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,599
lineage and there's a big problem in

1277
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,920
Canada I don't know if it's as bad in

1278
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:47,240
the United States with just renaming and

1279
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,000
like so much stuff just gets the wor it

1280
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:52,679
just like in BC alone like when Purple

1281
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,358
Kush hit it just there must have been a

1282
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,358
hundred different names for it you know

1283
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:58,799
what I mean and uh so yeah it's a big

1284
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:01,400
big problem um I've had this strain it's

1285
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,400
kind of funny it's quite a funny story

1286
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,838
if you even Google it it will lead you

1287
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,358
down the wrong path called Death Bubba

1288
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,838
and like the the death Bubba name came

1289
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:13,199
from us getting it into a dispensary

1290
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:15,558
like and it was just an an accident like

1291
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,279
everything like growing up in the 990s

1292
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,640
we'd call like if it was something was

1293
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,559
really good we'd describe it as the

1294
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,318
death I got the death yeah you know what

1295
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,319
I mean so we don't with the kill the

1296
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,400
kill the kills I got the kills I got the

1297
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:30,000
death that killer yeah exactly so and

1298
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,440
then like um after PK like different

1299
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,358
types of Bubba started coming on the

1300
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,119
scene and they be started becoming

1301
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:39,039
really popular like and they were killer

1302
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,559
like and uh like I we how the name

1303
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,800
actually happened there was a buddy of

1304
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,559
mine took it to this dispensary Eden in

1305
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,119
Vancouver and it was one of the biggest

1306
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,240
chains and I I remember just saying to

1307
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,160
him just just show it to him get him to

1308
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,239
smoke it look at the death yeah it's the

1309
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,159
death man it's and then like my buddy's

1310
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,919
like it's death it's Bubba and then like

1311
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,879
somehow he said it's death Bubba and

1312
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,480
that's how the how the name got started

1313
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,880
and what's what's kind of funny is I

1314
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,119
dealt with a lot of people but I didn't

1315
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,720
deal with the main guy and the main guy

1316
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,079
just I got put in touch with him by

1317
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,719
bubble man just like a couple weeks ago

1318
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,599
like I have to ask you about this

1319
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,519
because he was the person in charge of

1320
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:14,400
it and yeah they they absolutely loved

1321
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:16,199
it it was their number one seller for

1322
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,519
until we stopped giving it to them and

1323
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,759
same with the MK W it got so popular

1324
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:23,079
that other dispensaries just started

1325
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,800
copying the name like there' be lineups

1326
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:26,519
outside the door for people to get it

1327
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,680
right so people would just rename it

1328
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,480
yeah such BS but yeah happens all the

1329
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:31,879
time the MK Ultra was that yeah well

1330
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,960
that's what H with those were the two

1331
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,640
strains we had death Bubba and MK but

1332
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,480
they decided just to call it

1333
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:41,039
mku like that Eden made this decision to

1334
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,599
call it mku like we never said that and

1335
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,000
we just called it MK and um then

1336
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,800
everybody just copied it and like there

1337
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,159
is a really good mku string but it's

1338
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,680
it's nothing like this like the Master

1339
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:55,759
Kush that I was growing or even related

1340
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:57,838
oh yours was the yes so mku is MK Ultra

1341
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,480
and but they called it

1342
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,199
your MK and then people just started

1343
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,760
stealing the name and because like the

1344
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,279
strain became so popular there was

1345
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,040
another really good mku strain so you

1346
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,839
know unless you're from like the early

1347
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,318
2000s and you bought that and stuff most

1348
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:12,440
people don't know the difference because

1349
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,519
like mku is like a really popular strain

1350
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,519
that a lot of people die hard grow and

1351
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,318
like it which in my opinion is more like

1352
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:20,000
the Bubba strains like there were all

1353
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,800
these different Bubba strains that I

1354
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,639
felt were somewhat related even though

1355
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,680
they had different flavors but and like

1356
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:31,318
they all had OG in them soapy OG yeah

1357
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:34,279
I I love Bubba you know I think uh Bubba

1358
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:35,679
got bastardized in the Bay Area so what

1359
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,599
happened is it became the commercial

1360
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:41,039
strain because you could harvest in 54

1361
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:44,599
days and so the Asian Community blew it

1362
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:47,920
out I mean blew it out like no tomorrow

1363
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:50,599
this is before runs and before lcg

1364
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,880
Bubbas were the big thing and I grew up

1365
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,640
with the different Bubba same thing with

1366
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,920
Master Kush we had a Master Kush that

1367
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:59,799
would it would Branch out laterally so

1368
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,920
you'd get lateral uh so the BRS would

1369
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,800
grow sideways almost like a Christmas

1370
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,440
tree so the buds they they were ugly

1371
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,480
looking or weird looking I wouldn't say

1372
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,760
ugly but they were almost Chris like

1373
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,880
Charlie Bown Christmas tree looking buds

1374
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,000
okay and then we had the Bubba and the

1375
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:19,400
Bubba was like this soapy smelled like

1376
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,480
Irish Springs OG gassy both of them were

1377
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,599
extremely gassy extremely pungent and

1378
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,039
those were for me those were the Exotics

1379
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,400
of my day back in the '90s and early

1380
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,440
2000s yeah one one thing about the two

1381
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,760
that I um really big difference that I

1382
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,880
would notice like death Bubba and bubas

1383
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,599
could go purple yeah and lighter color

1384
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,358
with yellow leaves where that the master

1385
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,760
cush strain that we had no purple it

1386
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,679
goes completely only yellow yellow in

1387
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,680
the yellow and lime green like somewhere

1388
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:48,719
in there yeah yeah but no purple at all

1389
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:50,558
and it was um the death Bubba was also a

1390
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,039
lot more forgiving of a strain where you

1391
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,359
like you make a little mistake or feed

1392
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,358
it too much food you could kind of

1393
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,279
recover and go a little bit longer

1394
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,199
Master Kush it's like you give it too

1395
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,200
much food or do anything or you lock it

1396
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:02,519
out you're [ __ ] it just shuts down

1397
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,358
yeah so that was my experience too with

1398
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:06,358
OG Kush back in the day was like it was

1399
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:07,920
a finicky strain it was totally worth it

1400
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:10,159
but I never got really big yields with

1401
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,559
OG but it was like the best smoke ever

1402
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,118
and everyone wanted me to grow it but I

1403
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:15,760
didn't want to grow it because the

1404
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,280
yields were so bad yeah and I mean I

1405
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,760
grew it for myself for smoke same thing

1406
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,040
with cookies I grew that for myself for

1407
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,599
smoke back in the day but it wasn't like

1408
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:23,838
the big producer and I grew a

1409
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,240
combination of different I always like

1410
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,239
having different flavor oh totally but I

1411
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,598
also like mastering flavors and

1412
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,439
mastering growing one thing like we've

1413
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,200
tried multiple breeding projects like

1414
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,039
anybody that ever got the death Bubba

1415
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:37,480
could never get it to produce pollen

1416
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:39,558
it's kind of weird like before different

1417
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,440
people attempted it and they' get pollen

1418
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:44,440
sacks um but no one ever got any pollen

1419
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:48,000
out of it but I'm still yet s is like

1420
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,200
that okay you know I think SF uh Mac one

1421
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,519
is a partial triploid like a natural

1422
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:53,919
partial triplo and so that's what I

1423
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:55,838
think it might be naturally or not I'd

1424
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,280
be interested to see someone cross it

1425
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,440
yeah see how

1426
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,599
see what happens when you yeah I mean

1427
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,318
reverse it you make some pollen see if

1428
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,519
you can reverse it even yeah well if

1429
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:06,239
even if you can't reverse it you could

1430
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,679
still cross it though no you can still

1431
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,279
you could still pollinate it yeah you

1432
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,480
could still pollinate it and I like it

1433
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,119
the thing I like about it is the

1434
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,039
stability of it yeah like well like it

1435
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,920
would what's really weird is I would get

1436
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,039
over the 20 years of growing it like I

1437
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,760
could get it to produce seeds yeah but

1438
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,199
only like a few like uh my cousin he

1439
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,480
could barely fit through the aisle of

1440
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,798
the room and I remember when he's

1441
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,719
walking through the plants are like

1442
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:30,280
shaking like crazy well that say out of

1443
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:32,679
40 PBS well we might have got 30 seeds

1444
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,400
wow like you know found 30 seeds

1445
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:36,879
throughout the crop all fully mature and

1446
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,440
on one of them I remember um sprouting

1447
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,559
them and they were literally the fenos

1448
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,200
were identical like they you couldn't

1449
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,319
tell the difference but I didn't back

1450
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,679
then we didn't have like I wasn't COA

1451
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:48,318
getting them tested but like I didn't

1452
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,480
even keep them because they just looked

1453
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,000
identical I kind of regret and not it w

1454
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,599
but yeah yeah totally I mean that's when

1455
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,358
you have stable genetics right like

1456
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,559
that's that's a good sign of stability

1457
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:00,318
when the seeds come out exact like the

1458
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:03,480
parent especially s1's I've never seen

1459
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:05,318
any type of male flower or anything on

1460
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,000
it like so it must be internally that it

1461
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:09,279
does it and it pollinates itself like

1462
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,599
for it to produce the seed well that's a

1463
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,720
survival mechanism that the plants have

1464
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,440
and like typically a plant all if

1465
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:18,000
they're under any sort of stress will

1466
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,838
produce a seed you know sometimes it's

1467
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,280
only one seed and I mean even the most

1468
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,798
stable varieties will produce a seed

1469
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,119
gotcha yeah so and it like you know

1470
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:28,358
almost every other crop I would also see

1471
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,760
like and this is I can remember it for

1472
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:33,199
10 years like out of nowhere you'd see

1473
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,880
like this weird growth coming out of it

1474
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,000
like where you'd be six weeks in flower

1475
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,838
but then you all of a sudden like a

1476
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,719
lower Branch would have this like three

1477
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,199
week old growth kind of weird and I

1478
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,118
would always cut it out and not but I

1479
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:45,798
never ever see it just it clearly always

1480
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,880
stuck out because hey why is it doing

1481
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:49,599
that you know and it also another cool

1482
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,039
thing about the strain is it will have

1483
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,559
round tops and pointy tops and like for

1484
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:56,920
whatever reason like lately it's just

1485
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,160
all pointy but like on the last person I

1486
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,079
saw grow it we were seeing a bunch of

1487
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,798
round tops again and I can't explain why

1488
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,839
it does that light spectrum yeah I guess

1489
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:07,318
so huh probably light spectrum something

1490
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:08,798
like that I would say it's environmental

1491
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:10,679
but I'm saying even in like the same

1492
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,679
room even in the same room on the same

1493
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:13,919
plant yeah like in the same room with

1494
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,039
multiple plants like you'll see some

1495
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,720
that are pointy and then some are around

1496
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,239
interesting like under the same Spectrum

1497
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:21,279
you can get different results that's why

1498
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:25,439
I wasn't sure like I saw it for a year

1499
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,880
like you know all my crops are were well

1500
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,599
I've got two under LED with death Bubba

1501
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,798
and I've got probably like 100 plus

1502
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,440
under HPS with it nice yeah well it's

1503
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:38,519
just like I monocropped it because for a

1504
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,838
decade yeah well it when people love it

1505
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,358
though and you never get sick of it like

1506
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:44,400
that's the true sign that it's amazing

1507
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,480
too is when people never get sick of it

1508
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,798
you never get sick of it yeah because

1509
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,960
like something like green crack I love

1510
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:51,719
grow I loved growing green crack and

1511
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,639
then I would smoke it and it would be

1512
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:55,598
cool for like the first first couple

1513
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:57,000
days yeah I mean even the first couple

1514
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,400
weeks like it gets you really the first

1515
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,838
couple days and then you build a

1516
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,920
tolerance to it and then after a couple

1517
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,159
weeks you're like nah I don't want to

1518
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,440
ever grow this again I might grow it

1519
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:07,118
again a couple years later yeah I've

1520
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,159
definitely grown up before too and feel

1521
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,760
the same way about it nitrous oxide and

1522
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:13,159
beef jerky those are the turps so yeah

1523
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,079
that's what I get on the nose with that

1524
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:16,679
stuff and I didn't actually make that up

1525
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:18,440
I read that online somebody else wrote

1526
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:21,118
that but I was like [ __ ] you smell it

1527
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,599
it smells like nitrous oxide beef jerky

1528
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,440
and uh but yeah that's the one where

1529
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:28,318
it's like in the beginning it gets you

1530
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,599
super high and then by the time you're

1531
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:30,719
building a tolerance to it you start

1532
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,838
sharing with your friends you're like

1533
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,719
why are you guys [ __ ] so hot but yeah

1534
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,239
this a good one yeah these days I like

1535
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:40,719
to just obviously selection is key like

1536
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:43,399
having so many different flavors and

1537
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:45,358
stuff to pick from yeah well I like like

1538
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,358
you know I like six-star hash or like

1539
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:48,639
really highend rosin and like having a

1540
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:51,199
bunch of different flavors and what I

1541
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:53,078
like about it is um being able to have

1542
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:55,358
it put it in the freezer and 6 months

1543
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,640
later it's still nice and yeah that's

1544
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,519
like you can't beat that that's where

1545
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,000
it's like I do that with flour too right

1546
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:02,239
so I feel like flour I can come out a

1547
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,798
year later and it's still PR by just

1548
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,919
sticking it in the yeah so I you cure it

1549
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:08,358
properly so you dry it you cure it

1550
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,960
properly and then you put it in a

1551
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:13,199
sandwich bag Loosely and then you vacuum

1552
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,318
seal and then in the freezer and then in

1553
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:16,798
the freezer and you want a stable

1554
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:18,838
freezer that doesn't have ice or

1555
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:21,679
anything like that and you label and

1556
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:23,039
date it and you're good to go uh the

1557
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,679
first person that ever showed me that

1558
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:29,039
was a guy named Ben from IC Collective

1559
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,598
okay and you know it's like Game Changer

1560
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,279
i've smoked stuff that was 2 and a half

1561
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:36,119
years old that was pretty [ __ ]

1562
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,319
amazing cool man so yeah like uh so that

1563
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,160
that's kind of one of the biggest things

1564
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:40,639
why I like it and like also with water

1565
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:42,719
hash to and making everything fresh

1566
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,598
which I like I'm about to start doing

1567
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,679
yeah I just like the idea that you're

1568
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,838
getting every last bit of resin like how

1569
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:50,719
much are you losing when you're

1570
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:53,440
harvesting and like and trimming and

1571
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,879
like what's a fair number 25% by the

1572
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,760
time everything is shaking and

1573
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,440
everything is moving versus if you're

1574
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,359
washing it and it or if it's going right

1575
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,599
into the freezer Frozen I just smoked

1576
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:02,920
some bubble house that was like four

1577
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:07,039
years old in my freezer because I'm

1578
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:09,240
moving and BR in it tasted amazing yeah

1579
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,039
well that's that's exactly like I I have

1580
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:13,318
a little six light medical where I can

1581
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,480
also test um different you know lighting

1582
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:16,838
and use it for R&amp;D but my I've been

1583
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,960
growing three strains but I plan on

1584
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:21,920
doing it to like six strains so that I

1585
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,920
can you know have six flavers wash them

1586
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,838
and then have just keep on storing them

1587
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,318
in my freezer so like after a few years

1588
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:29,960
I'm going to have it just a shitload of

1589
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:32,719
flavors for when people come over right

1590
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,400
yeah variety is always nice absolutely

1591
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,078
just having that selection and also just

1592
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,358
for if you're doing Edibles or

1593
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,359
everything it's yeah yeah and they all

1594
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:43,159
have different effects too like so I'm

1595
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:45,480
big on the effects like I'm more

1596
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:46,960
recently since my buddy Dave has passed

1597
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,679
I've really been thinking a lot about

1598
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,760
what's important at the end of the day

1599
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:54,078
the effect and the flavor I mean but

1600
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,720
there's there I I kind of went away from

1601
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,519
putting an emphasis on effect and was so

1602
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,039
heavily focused on Flavor for a long

1603
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:03,119
time I'm also a chef also get excited

1604
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,719
about flavors and excited about effect

1605
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,880
too but like I like the effect of

1606
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,519
cannabis in general but like there are

1607
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:12,680
certain uh cultivars and certain

1608
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:15,480
varieties that you smoke that are like

1609
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:17,480
wow I feel [ __ ] great or wow I'm

1610
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,480
[ __ ] awake first thing in the morning

1611
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,880
or wow [ __ ] I can go to bed

1612
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,400
absolutely and being able to just have

1613
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,599
those when you want them it's kind of

1614
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,880
nice or even the combination of

1615
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:29,680
combining them um really like tolerance

1616
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,680
breaks like well I don't like

1617
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,000
necessarily like I because I use it to

1618
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,919
sleep and I kind of have serious

1619
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,719
insomnia without but at the same time

1620
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,639
it's like your tolerance just gets so

1621
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:39,838
strong and it's like you're take like

1622
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,318
every now and again I like to take like

1623
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,558
a full month off it's kind of hard for

1624
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:46,159
me to do yeah getting through the first

1625
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,280
week like I I literally when I quit

1626
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:50,000
Edibles like and after I built my

1627
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,160
tolerance I literally withdraw like my

1628
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,838
body physically addicted I need it to

1629
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,519
sleep right and so like I go through

1630
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,199
hell for about a week but after that

1631
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,079
week and then like on the 30 day Mark

1632
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:03,639
it's just like you get so high when you

1633
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,119
try smoking something or like for or

1634
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:06,759
edibles is almost too strong I have to

1635
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,160
go so light afterwards but it's just

1636
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,359
kind of nice to have that tolerance

1637
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:13,920
break and really feel the feel what it

1638
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:15,920
can do yeah yeah yeah I think it's good

1639
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,559
I you know I I have a tough time with

1640
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,400
tolerance breaks like real tolerance

1641
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:22,240
breaks going to shows going to events

1642
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,559
you know it's like the majority of my

1643
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:26,838
friends smoke and exactly and we're

1644
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,160

1645
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:31,038
you got oh dude like yeah this white

1646
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:32,358
Thorn Rose I got some of that and I was

1647
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,960
sharing it with all my friends and it's

1648
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:36,880
like oh it's [ __ ] feel good weed yeah

1649
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,199
I like you know and I'm back to I I like

1650
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,039
some of those Feelgood ones where it's

1651
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:42,038
not really an indicia it's not really a

1652
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:46,000
sativa where they would classify it as

1653
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:47,359
narcotic or you know uh stimulant it's

1654
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,480
somewhere in the middle where you smoke

1655
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:50,358
it and you're just like you got a big

1656
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,480
smile on your face every time you smoke

1657
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:55,558
it every time I smoke that white Thorn

1658
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,079
Rose my buddy's Blue 13 it puts a smile

1659
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,960
on my face and I feel feel good like I

1660
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:00,640
just feel it doesn't matter whether it's

1661
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,519
in the morning whether it's at night

1662
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,679
it's just feel good weed and there's

1663
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,318
just something about those where it has

1664
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:10,358
just those effects where it's like you

1665
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:11,798
feel great yeah so yeah and I haven't

1666
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:14,199
tried I mean I've tried the rosin of the

1667
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:15,358
white Thorn that same thing I but the

1668
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:16,759
problem is is when it's good like that

1669
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:18,440
and I only had a gram I just smoked it

1670
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,000
all because yeah it's easy to smoke a

1671
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,960
gram when it makes you feel good oh

1672
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,318
absolutely so yeah so how did you get

1673
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,240
your start in the industry you've been

1674
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:30,960
do at this a while right yeah yeah well

1675
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:33,879
um I remember like well 90

1676
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,480
1994 guy I knew he's like running some

1677
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,480
from some people from a park and he's

1678
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,280
just running through property after

1679
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,000
property and runs into like this crazy

1680
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:46,680
ass field like hundreds of plants in

1681
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,280
full of flower so um that was kind of my

1682
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:50,239
start well like he just started telling

1683
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,680
everybody and we had pound we had

1684
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,318
garbage bags and pounds the biggest

1685
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:57,558
problem was trying to dry it yeah I bet

1686
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:59,159
and then um yeah I like you know ever

1687
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:02,440
since then and like I got in a lot of

1688
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:04,759
trouble as a teenager lucky for the

1689
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,400
young Offenders Act in Canada because

1690
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,039
anything you do gets sealed when you're

1691
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,760
19 or whatever so I'm definitely had a

1692
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:13,520
lot of ups and downs and just got in a

1693
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,640
lot of trouble um once I was about 17

1694
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,318
years old I kind of figured out the

1695
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,159
right path or became pretty good at what

1696
00:58:17,318 --> 00:58:21,880
I was doing yeah and then just kind of

1697
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:24,318
stuck with it my whole life like well 96

1698
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,240
was the very first indoor that we I got

1699
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:28,838
into it was kind of funny I remember I

1700
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,759
was walking through a path um in my

1701
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,838
neighborhood and I just happen to be

1702
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:36,200
walking by and this guy opens his door

1703
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:38,279
and the light just comes blaring out I

1704
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:41,118
see it like you can't hide it yeah and

1705
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,280
he sees that I I saw it he tells me to

1706
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,640
come over and then we ended I'm like no

1707
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,280
don't worry I'm cool we ended up started

1708
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:47,318
talking and it was just a four lighter

1709
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,280
but he didn't have any money for

1710
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:51,279
nutrients I was funny I remember buying

1711
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,720
General Hydroponics and that was our

1712
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,280
very first uh four lighter and so three

1713
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:57,679
part was good back in the day I remember

1714
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,480
three part and I never had a problem

1715
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,480
with it back in the day I never hated on

1716
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,280
it oh no that's what that's what

1717
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,559
everybody like let's be honest in the

1718
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,798
mid 90s like that's what everybody used

1719
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:10,119
and I remember was O aonic was that what

1720
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,440
it called it said for bigger bank

1721
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,519
accounts and larger yields there was

1722
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,760
this other product I used a couple other

1723
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,960
products um cool Bloom and just a few

1724
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,760
other things that we used back then yeah

1725
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,079
and um you know I had like lots of um

1726
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,359
success and then like by the time I was

1727
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:27,519
in like my like the early 2000s I was

1728
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:31,000
more like the person in charge it wasn't

1729
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,960
me really growing yeah and um you know I

1730
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,199
went on a pretty nice run with that for

1731
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,318
quite a while and um I actually had

1732
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,919
gotten into out of it for almost like a

1733
00:59:37,318 --> 00:59:41,798
couple years because I was playing poker

1734
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,318
like I evolved into playing online poker

1735
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:46,519
and then um I'd done really really well

1736
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,599
like I was playing 16 tables at a time

1737
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:49,920
and a couple hundred thousand hands or

1738
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:53,160
over a couple hundred thousand hands a

1739
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,519
year and doing a really successful at it

1740
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:57,440
just killing it and then one day um

1741
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,239
everything got seized by the FBI like

1742
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,200
poker stars in Full Tilt got shut down

1743
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:03,679
and They seized all the money and that

1744
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,960
put me yeah like it was crazy like and

1745
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,159
it was I ended up getting my money back

1746
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,159
like a year and a bit later whatever but

1747
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,598
I was like relying on that and like I

1748
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:14,078
was doing you know I had I thought okay

1749
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:15,760
well this is my career what I'm going to

1750
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,839
do I'm really good at this and I can

1751
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,160
make money and but then that happened

1752
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:24,000
and that like pushed me back into

1753
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,719
growing and I remember um I bought these

1754
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,119
uh cuz like this isn't legal these are

1755
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:30,159
still the wild west and uh we bought

1756
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:32,318
these cargo trailers that were like

1757
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,639
portable so that like you can just hook

1758
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,400
up the power and water if there's an

1759
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:37,400
issue you can get them out of there

1760
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,798
right right so I I hook I bought like a

1761
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,000
well I set them up like a 10 lighter and

1762
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,199
an eight lighter and on the very first

1763
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,599
crop like I've been so out of touch with

1764
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:46,919
growing like because it wasn't me the

1765
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:49,480
one that was doing it and I like this is

1766
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:52,159
hilarious but on the 10 lighter I did I

1767
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,798
got two and a half pounds a total crop

1768
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:56,199
and the eight lighter like a pound and a

1769
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:57,880
half and I literally locked them out

1770
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:59,038
like totally and like I I remember my

1771
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,440
buddy being like how does it feel to be

1772
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,079
like the worst grower in the world like

1773
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,760
the couple people were just riding me I

1774
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:06,280
was like going crazy I was like

1775
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,839
frustrated because I needed the money

1776
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,319
too and it's was like then I just went

1777
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:13,038
and I talked to every last OG I know

1778
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:15,480
picked their brain you know like that's

1779
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,319
growing the true kills and it's like on

1780
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,358
the next crop I just knocked it out of

1781
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:21,920
the freaking Park and then like just

1782
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:23,440
from that point on it just kind of got

1783
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,639
better and better and better and then

1784
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,358
the medical licensing came out and that

1785
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:29,960
was just just like so nice when it came

1786
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,838
out having an actual medical license and

1787
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,358
having that security I remember when it

1788
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,880
first got issued you actually get like a

1789
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:38,159
government ID oh wow and I remember

1790
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,720
remember getting stopped and the cops

1791
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,879
are like oh [ __ ] like they could smelled

1792
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:42,358
and everything I remember showing it to

1793
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,838
them the cop had never even seen it or

1794
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:46,400
even heard of it like what the [ __ ] I

1795
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:48,920
remember just having that card being

1796
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,720
like Oh literally your get out of jail

1797
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,720
card yeah it's just like such a relief

1798
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,919
on the cops weren't you know weren't

1799
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,879
used to it either so then yeah I just

1800
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,480
went on a a really nice run doing that

1801
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,599
and then um I started making YouTube

1802
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:05,358
videos and then um like one day I made a

1803
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:08,760
video saying like hey is there's any LED

1804
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:10,440
companies out there send me an LED and

1805
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,000
uh I'll prove that it works because I I

1806
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,000
was an HPS guy and didn't believe in

1807
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,278
them at all yeah then finally a company

1808
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,559
reached out to me and you know I tried

1809
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:19,920
it and like I could see that hey this is

1810
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,400
this is working pretty nice and like

1811
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,798
halfway through the crop I was like hey

1812
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,278
if this goes well can I get the Canadian

1813
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:27,119
distribution rights and they were like

1814
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:28,519
sure at the time they they were nothing

1815
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,880
and didn't have any money anyways and

1816
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:31,639
they were happy to be working with me

1817
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,200
and they were like sure yeah so then

1818
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:36,239
that went on and then um it just it was

1819
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:39,399
kind of crazy how fast things happened

1820
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,879
like and then yeah and then um four and

1821
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,680
a half years later I ended up just

1822
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,960
starting my own company nice yeah it's

1823
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,879
amazing how stuff can snowball you know

1824
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,079
yeah well it's like the power of um I

1825
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,240
always try to tell people that anything

1826
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,880
can happen so fast like what can happen

1827
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,798
in one year if you work on it every

1828
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,720
single day and don't give up it's pretty

1829
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,639
crazy like the power of doubling too

1830
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:02,358
like of yeah you know having one

1831
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,879
facility and going to two facilities and

1832
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:07,519
then going to four three or so on

1833
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,358
scaling is an art too that's yeah but

1834
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,239
while having work ethic and also knowing

1835
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:13,078
about I think it's also a skill to be

1836
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:15,199
able to pull the be able to pull the

1837
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,559
plug too when you need to like not every

1838
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,879
idea I've had like even with the LED

1839
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:20,519
lighting like we've made plenty of

1840
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,278
mistakes and had to change direction or

1841
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:23,798
change what we're doing or you have to

1842
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:25,480
be able to identify hey this isn't

1843
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:27,880
working I got to pull the plug and

1844
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,480
change something or adjust or adapt

1845
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,599
being okay with making mistakes is one

1846
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,400
of the biggest things in business yeah

1847
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,440
if you can learn how to be okay with

1848
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:39,000
making mistakes then you have no fear

1849
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,200
and also recognizing that it's a mistake

1850
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,880
take responsibility take responsibility

1851
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:45,118
yeah you know because I feel like I've

1852
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,798
made over the last two years especially

1853
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,760
with James L genetics I made a bunch of

1854
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:52,358
mistakes but I learned from them and

1855
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:56,920
they made me smarter they made me better

1856
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:58,719
at what I do uh you know I'm focused on

1857
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,200
the plants now and being the one that's

1858
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,838
making the decision absolutely like I

1859
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:05,480
I've always kind of said that like you

1860
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:07,358
have to take responsibility if you can't

1861
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,400
admit it or try to blame it on somebody

1862
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:11,119
else you're not going anywhere fast well

1863
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,880
and sometimes there's like I've had to

1864
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:14,960
come to Jesus moments where I realize

1865
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,680
that nobody's gonna come there to save

1866
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,519
me I got to save myself right absolutely

1867
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:20,919
and those are some those are some great

1868
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,159
experiences I think that we all need to

1869
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,639
go through because a lot of times in

1870
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,440
life even when it's talking about I've

1871
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,920
been going to the gym lately by myself

1872
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,960
and I've had workout Partners I like

1873
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,599
workout Partners to a degree but I also

1874
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,039
just like going and doing the work and

1875
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:37,318
nobody's going to come save you you want

1876
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,160
to get in shape you got to do it

1877
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:40,920
yourself if your friends can't go work

1878
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:43,000
out with you you need to go to the gym

1879
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,519
you know if you want to be in shape you

1880
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,559
if or maybe you don't maybe you can go

1881
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:48,318
for a run maybe you can go for a walk

1882
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,039
but same thing with the plants if

1883
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:52,000
nobody's gonna you know if you you don't

1884
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:53,680
have anybody that's going to go thin the

1885
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,880
plants out you got to thin them out

1886
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,879
yourself and that's just the truth

1887
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,599
reality of it and the sooner you can get

1888
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,119
over that kind of stuff and just suck it

1889
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,359
up and say [ __ ] it this is what I got to

1890
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,920
do I want to be successful I want to be

1891
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:07,519
the best person that I can be you know I

1892
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,480
think those are those are the important

1893
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:11,159
things funny you said the gym because

1894
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,880
like that is one thing like I've been

1895
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:15,399
trying to brace myself I haven't done

1896
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,440
any real physical workout or like work

1897
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,480
been at a gym since my early 20s but in

1898
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,200
the last month I've been doing a couple

1899
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,240
hundred push-ups a day trying to embrace

1900
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:24,598
myself and it's like yeah like you said

1901
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:26,479
like no one's going to do it unless you

1902
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,680
do it yourself no one's going to come

1903
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,358
save you no one's going to come Force

1904
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,440
you go to the gym yeah I mean and it's

1905
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,000
so hard like I just even remember like

1906
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,960
it's kind of motivating now CU I can do

1907
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,760
it so easy but in after the first day of

1908
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,760
just doing a couple days I was like you

1909
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,000
just get so sore and getting it over

1910
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,000
that hump of being able to just have the

1911
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,079
motivation to do it to and want to do it

1912
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,480
well I think there's there's showing up

1913
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:49,559
and I think that's important because

1914
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:52,400
that's repetition and that's you know

1915
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:54,920
you there it requires a a a certain

1916
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,480
amount of discipline right just showing

1917
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,200
up right just getting there and showing

1918
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,119
up that's great but then when it comes

1919
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:02,919
to working out like putting the effort

1920
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:04,400
in because I look around the gym and

1921
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,400
they all look the [ __ ] same as when I

1922
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,680
was going to the gym two years ago and

1923
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,240
I'm getting really good results right

1924
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,960
now because I'm putting the effort in

1925
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,879
and when I go I make each rep count I

1926
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,720
don't do long workouts I do shorter

1927
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,680
workouts but I go there and I'm there

1928
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:20,358
for a purpose and I'm there I'm not

1929
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:23,798
there to socialize I'm there to get [ __ ]

1930
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:27,000
done just like I am at work exactly so

1931
01:06:23,798 --> 01:06:29,000
uh let's talk about the Emerson effect

1932
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,239
the Emerson effect okay yeah there's a

1933
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,318
lot of talk about that lately just like

1934
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:34,959
online and stuff and I I think it's a

1935
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:37,440
little bit confusing because people

1936
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,639
think the Emerson effect that means a

1937
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,119
lot of people think that's like putting

1938
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:44,000
your plants to sleep right and it's not

1939
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,680
it's just really the combination of 680

1940
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,559
nanometer and or lower and

1941
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:51,759
720 nanometer and higher so basically

1942
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:54,119
it's just having deep red and far red

1943
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,039
combined together um it allows the

1944
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:58,278
photosynthesis of the plant to be more

1945
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,640
efficiently and like we've seen lots of

1946
01:06:58,278 --> 01:07:02,838
people just without even like using it

1947
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:04,798
to put the plants to sleep um have

1948
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:06,599
faster crops by anywhere from like two

1949
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:08,838
to five days can you explain the

1950
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:12,400
difference between deep red and far red

1951
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:15,000
um so deep red is like 660 nanometer

1952
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,880
like if you're looking at it on a scale

1953
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,599
and and far red is 730 so it's just um

1954
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,160
yeah like they're they're right next to

1955
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:25,880
each other deep red like too much far

1956
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:28,679
red also is not good for your plants

1957
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,039
like um far red like in double-ended HPS

1958
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,318
a lot of people criticize it too because

1959
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,400
they don't understand it and they're all

1960
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:37,038
like oh you it's got way too much far

1961
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,599
red if it's got 6% but then like a lot

1962
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,920
of people blame stuff on Far red but

1963
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:44,200
then I always argue back well HPS has

1964
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:46,079
10.4% and it's never turned off yeah you

1965
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:47,598
know so I always come back to that and

1966
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:50,640
say it's another variable that you're

1967
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:53,798
blaming it on Far red um we find I find

1968
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:55,920
far red um just so beneficial like when

1969
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:57,559
we were adding like we have lights that

1970
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,039
can control it independently or that

1971
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:01,400
have it fixed in and we could just see

1972
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,079
that having it in the Spectrum um the

1973
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,599
plants like it better they prey better

1974
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,278
just everything about it they like

1975
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:08,119
better they get better color if you're

1976
01:08:06,278 --> 01:08:10,278
going for color which color is such a

1977
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:11,920
big qualifier now it's it's one of the

1978
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:14,599
boxes that needs to get checked with a

1979
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,079
lot of people yeah you know and I think

1980
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:18,520
what I've seen with the favin is you're

1981
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,519
getting with their their under canopy

1982
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,759
they have far red and does it have far

1983
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,719
red in it it does okay it does and it

1984
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:26,798
also gets purple purple buds on the

1985
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,439
bottom that are big yes and so I think

1986
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,319
that's just you know I think the

1987
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:33,599
potential for that so I'm excited to see

1988
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,640
you're under your your abs absolutely

1989
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,640
well we've um we've we've kind of

1990
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,920
designed it to have more light peratt

1991
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,798
than everybody else and we're going to

1992
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,920
be coming in with a cheaper price so

1993
01:08:41,798 --> 01:08:44,439
we're kind of going to shake up the

1994
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,000
industry like we've done with a lot of

1995
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:48,079
our other lighting um but we've what

1996
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,679
we've really done well we've really

1997
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:52,439
shaken up the industry just with some of

1998
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,279
our lighting with the value um in it and

1999
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:57,238
the reason why we're able to do that is

2000
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:59,279
because we're extremely efficient like

2001
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:01,119
I've been well we've been at this for a

2002
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,719
while and it's like everything we've

2003
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:04,358
done we're setting up where like our

2004
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,880
competitors are spending tens of

2005
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:08,000
thousands of dollars a month on rent

2006
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,199
where we don't pay rent like we're just

2007
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,238
we you know for our Michigan

2008
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,198
distribution we just bought our building

2009
01:09:11,238 --> 01:09:15,759
like and we're just every like in that

2010
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,439
aspect we're just set up um so much more

2011
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,798
efficiently like a lot of I built an

2012
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,559
army of people working on commission you

2013
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:24,278
know over 50 people and you don't get

2014
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,798
paid unless you actually make a sale and

2015
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:27,400
it's just a lot more motivating for

2016
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:29,759
people I've always tried to do that too

2017
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:32,358
with grows like of all the grows over my

2018
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,399
years like I didn't like having workers

2019
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:36,400
like I like having partners make someone

2020
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:38,519
a partner we bleed together if we're

2021
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:40,599
gonna bleed and it's you know it's

2022
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,679
motivation and like I've always trying

2023
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,920
to you know doesn't always work out and

2024
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:46,798
I've had a I've broken so many people

2025
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,079
trying to do that yeah you know what I

2026
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,158
mean but I like trying to start a

2027
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,479
business I remember like I've had we

2028
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:53,960
could just say other businesses on the

2029
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,879
distribution and people think oh I'm

2030
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,560
gonna start that and it's like good luck

2031
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,119
buddy like trying to start something

2032
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:02,080
like that yeah try working it every

2033
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,359
single day yourself for a year yeah

2034
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:04,840
before you're even gonna think about

2035
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,599
hiring it's almost like any business

2036
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,600
like I I had a really I had a Don like I

2037
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,039
I owned a Donaire business I didn't work

2038
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,679
I didn't work it but I had like a really

2039
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,600
good this girl that was a employee and

2040
01:10:12,679 --> 01:10:16,239
she was just an incredible worker and we

2041
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,199
did so well and it's like the second you

2042
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:20,479
get to somebody that's doing the bare

2043
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:23,039
minimum it's just like the place fails

2044
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:25,359
yeah well it's it's such it's it's such

2045
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,920
a challenge a lot of times because of

2046
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,238
the balance you know it's like hard to

2047
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,880
find someone that complimentary that

2048
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:32,519
that's willing to put in the work for me

2049
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,920
it's always like I'm the Workhorse I

2050
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,480
don't mind being the Workhorse I love

2051
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,640
that part of it yeah and then you need

2052
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:40,079
to have someone that's complimentary

2053
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,360
that's able to Bal be the balance right

2054
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,319
at the end of the day you don't need an

2055
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:47,279
exact duplicate of yourself you need

2056
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:48,960
someone that's the complimentary version

2057
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,000
of yourself that adds the things that

2058
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,279
you don't contribute and I feel like

2059
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,920
I've gone through enough relationships

2060
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:55,319
and Partnerships I love Partnerships I

2061
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,600
love Partnerships working with people

2062
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:59,279
people bleeding together winning

2063
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,840
together and losing together you know

2064
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,719
and it's like it makes losing not as bad

2065
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,679
and it makes winning even better and the

2066
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,920
right partner can make it amazing and

2067
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:12,719
the wrong partner can just make it hell

2068
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,840
absolutely yeah like I I almost like

2069
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,719
I've had to make deals in my life where

2070
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:19,480
I almost felt like I made a poor

2071
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:21,399
decision well like a poor deal on my

2072
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:24,000
let's just say for example it's a 50/50

2073
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:25,879
partnership except for I'm doing all the

2074
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,760
work and the other person put up the

2075
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,920
money and a lot of people criticize that

2076
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,640
but I always you know I'm the one that

2077
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,000
made the deal and yeah it sucked and it

2078
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,400
wasn't really fair but guess what at the

2079
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,238
end of our five years we got that was

2080
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:39,519
the reason why I got way ahead you know

2081
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,039
what I mean like and having that and

2082
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,239
being able to recognize that so like I

2083
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,039
know a lot of people don't think it's

2084
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:46,439
fair well if you don't have the money to

2085
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:47,600
start sometimes you have to you have to

2086
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:49,359
sacrifice something yeah you have to

2087
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,159
sacrifice something and like I I can

2088
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:54,119
remember like I had a 5-year deal on a

2089
01:11:51,158 --> 01:11:56,000
place and I I hated it like I I like

2090
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:58,439
after a few years and we were doing well

2091
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,198
and um like I used to I didn't bring

2092
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,678
this up but on YouTube I was probably

2093
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:04,799
the first person in the world that put

2094
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,480
the most aggressive Leaf strip online

2095
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,279
and uh like before three of light and I

2096
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:10,759
just like I would bring in a crew and I

2097
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,000
would strip my plants naked in the

2098
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,560
middle of the crop and I remember day 21

2099
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,880
you just oh I actually would do it on

2100
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:19,800
day 15 oh wow for for me if I can unless

2101
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,600
I needed the plants to fill out more

2102
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,960
yeah so and like we we would get like

2103
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,760
crazy aggressive but the reason why I

2104
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,279
brought this up is I'm 50/50 partner but

2105
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,480
I'm responsible for it so I'm bringing

2106
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:32,920
people in to do it in pain and it's

2107
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:35,079
coming out of my side right you know and

2108
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,199
like I you know deals like that I would

2109
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:39,479
be frustrated with but at the same time

2110
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:40,960
well hey I ended up like I'm not

2111
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:42,718
complaining about on the money I made on

2112
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,198
owning the host House at the End of the

2113
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,399
five years and everything like you know

2114
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:48,000
what I mean and I sometimes you just

2115
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:49,719
have to you could say make a deal with

2116
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,960
the devil if you have to or makes an

2117
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:54,840
unfair situ deal to get ahead and

2118
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,359
sometimes they're unfair in a certain

2119
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,800
perspective perspective and it's just

2120
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:59,759
all about life is all about perspective

2121
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,480
any yeah well like exactly a perspective

2122
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,520
it's not in the bigger picture unfair

2123
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:05,479
because like they put up like how hard

2124
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,440
is it to save up six digits plus of

2125
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:09,718
money and and also have the balls to

2126
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:13,000
invest it and do it without securing it

2127
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:15,960
having that kind of stuff right yeah I

2128
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,920
mean a lot of it comes down to balls too

2129
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:20,639
absolutely like I've had a pretty good

2130
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,920
track record for when it comes to like

2131
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:24,560
investing in stuff or like getting

2132
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,000
people to come or like if I come to

2133
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,039
someone for money so it's like I've

2134
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,359
never really had too much of a problem

2135
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:32,198
but I can like I've had a lot of other

2136
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:33,960
people that that have said no you know

2137
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:36,559
what I mean that just because they're

2138
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,039
afraid of it or whatever but yeah if you

2139
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,920
have a pretty solid business plan and a

2140
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:42,198
track record it's a lot easier well and

2141
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,520
it's not all money is good money yeah

2142
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:45,559
and so it's about finding the right

2143
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,560
partner the right person it's like

2144
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:51,120
that's I've seen that happen before you

2145
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,800
know myself and you myself too yeah yeah

2146
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:55,639
where I wasn't yeah happy with my

2147
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,360
partner or who I'm associated with

2148
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,920
I mean I'm in the perfect situation now

2149
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:01,719
with my partner and we're the balance

2150
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:03,480
with each other yeah you know and we we

2151
01:14:01,719 --> 01:14:06,920
contribute both of us contribute a lot

2152
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:09,158
to the business and different things and

2153
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,880
it's just you know I wake up in the

2154
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:12,479
morning and I'm excited to come to work

2155
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,199
and those are the you know you know it's

2156
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,279
good when you wake up at 5: in the

2157
01:14:14,198 --> 01:14:17,359
morning you're like I'm going to the gym

2158
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:19,399
and then I get to go to work yeah

2159
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:21,039
exactly and just enjoy everything youve

2160
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:22,960
built and just everybody that you're

2161
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,359
working with and I kind of feel the same

2162
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,960
way even though I'm busier than I've

2163
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:29,158
ever been in my Whole Life by far I

2164
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,079
enjoy it and it's like I I enjoy that

2165
01:14:29,158 --> 01:14:33,719
like I have late nights in China you

2166
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:35,679
know four to five times a week you know

2167
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:37,560
just and I enjoy it though I enjoy the

2168
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:40,158
hustle I've been and it's rewarding to

2169
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:42,000
see where we're at too it's like in the

2170
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:43,759
last two and a half years so much has

2171
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,639
changed like even when I go back a year

2172
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,600
from now and it's like it's it's such a

2173
01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:50,679
rewarding feeling of like I put I was in

2174
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,320
the craziest fight of my life and just

2175
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:54,039
every single day I just wouldn't stop

2176
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,519
and it's like we're really reaping the

2177
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:57,800
rewards and we're not slow

2178
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,280
at now we can really we' brought things

2179
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,400
to the market and we can innovate in

2180
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,599
other ways or do anything at this point

2181
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:04,238
and that's what it takes is just not

2182
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,400
getting up and even when it's tough

2183
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:07,718
putting the left foot in front of the

2184
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:09,679
right and the right foot in front of the

2185
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:11,520
left and just keep on moving forward

2186
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:15,359
yeah like we got killed in our very

2187
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:17,159
first year in Juice you could say

2188
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:19,359
because like I like I didn't borrow from

2189
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:22,079
a bank or anything you could say so it's

2190
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:23,679
just like I I did everything myself

2191
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:25,719
without having to bring anybody in and

2192
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,679
then after about a year one of my

2193
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:28,920
friends kind of jumped in and helped

2194
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,920
just because they could see how well

2195
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,920
things were going but yeah we haven't

2196
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,560
taken on any money it's just been us and

2197
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,239
exactly I think those are the best but

2198
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,360
also we've struggled you know it's like

2199
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:41,039
it's a struggle people everybody thinks

2200
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,599
like you're doing it you're killing it

2201
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:46,119
you're you know it's like yes but it's

2202
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,159
been a struggle it hasn't been easy good

2203
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:49,960
things are never easy at least in my

2204
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:53,599
experience most of the good things are

2205
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:55,158
challenging and I get reward and a lot

2206
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,120
of gratitude for everything that's gone

2207
01:15:55,158 --> 01:15:59,439
on absolutely like we caught a really

2208
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,359
big break about a little over a year ago

2209
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:05,359
with a client from Dubai and we just did

2210
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:07,679
like a was 166,000 light deal wow yeah

2211
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:09,119
so it was like we designed a we designed

2212
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,119
a custom light from them and it was just

2213
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:12,880
like a massive break for us that just

2214
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:15,479
allowed us to kind of get into another

2215
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,119
league and was it for indoor cultivation

2216
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:20,559
yes it's for growing lettuce wow yeah

2217
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:23,279
it's in like three tier two tier oh more

2218
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,960
than that like a insane tier like I

2219
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:26,479
don't even remember how many but like

2220
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,840
just the most ridiculous setup and they

2221
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:29,879
they originally had come to us with a

2222
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,920
design that was horrible and we

2223
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,880
redesigned everything and just improved

2224
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,158
their uniformity and we have them as a

2225
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,880
client too for like we're going to be

2226
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,119
doing another massive project with them

2227
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,920
and um that really just changed things

2228
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:44,399
for us that's awesome yeah so yeah and

2229
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,639
you never know like when you start a

2230
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,039
business you never know how long it's

2231
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:49,480
going to take usually with if you do

2232
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:52,039
build outs it takes twice as long and

2233
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:54,000
twice as much money but like oh just

2234
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:55,238
because you have an idea that's good

2235
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,920
doesn't mean you're necessar going to be

2236
01:16:55,238 --> 01:16:58,559
successful with it so like there is risk

2237
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,639
involved but once you once you start

2238
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,679
seeing the signs it's like you know

2239
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:04,800
you're onest stuff and figuring out just

2240
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:07,239
how to do everything like we had so many

2241
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,480
learning experiences like even from with

2242
01:17:07,238 --> 01:17:10,519
someone saying they're moving forward

2243
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,559
and not taking a deposit like there was

2244
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,239
someone that I thought was as good as

2245
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,480
gold before that told me and I made 500

2246
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:19,079
lights for them and then they backed out

2247
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:22,000
and it wasn't a model that like was

2248
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:23,880
popular selling and like it it to be

2249
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,639
quite Hest it tied it up for almost six

2250
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,960
months for me and like it was just a

2251
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:29,440
learning mistake and those typee of

2252
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,920
things of we had some crazy Financial

2253
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:33,158
challenges with just everything we're

2254
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,158
doing and then having so many lights and

2255
01:17:33,158 --> 01:17:37,119
then figuring out which ones perform the

2256
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:39,238
best and then having stock and yeah it

2257
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,519
was extremely challenging but it's you

2258
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,519
know like I said it's a rewarding

2259
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,159
feeling getting to hear totally the

2260
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,440
whole research and development aspect of

2261
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,839
it it's pretty wild especially with

2262
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,000
lighting it's like to well because you

2263
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,679
don't want to just make another light

2264
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,600
you have to make a light that's

2265
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:55,000
different that's better that has

2266
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,960
something that makes it stand out

2267
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,399
because there's gilan lights and then

2268
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,439
there's knockoff lights because it's

2269
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,319
like there's stuff coming out of China

2270
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:04,399
they're knocking off stuff and

2271
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:06,599
absolutely it's such a it's such a crazy

2272
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:08,000
market and we you know we wanted to do

2273
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,199
something different and that's where we

2274
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,279
came in and it's like we like I always

2275
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:14,879
say to people it's like name any company

2276
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:16,479
and compare it to one of our lights and

2277
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,279
let's like break it down in a lot of

2278
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:20,599
cases you're getting double the value

2279
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:23,000
with us so that means like if a the

2280
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,800
light cost double the cost to make but

2281
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,198
it's retailing for the same price yeah

2282
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,600
you know what I mean and that's where

2283
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:29,919
people that like when they start going

2284
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,199
down that rabbit hole it leads them to

2285
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,158
us right like if they want if they want

2286
01:18:32,198 --> 01:18:35,678
to have the best value they want to have

2287
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:38,079
the most efficient they want to have the

2288
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:41,440
most diversity they want it to run the

2289
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:43,600
coolest they're coming to us yeah yeah

2290
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:46,198
really cool so let's talk about your bug

2291
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,679
Light okay so yeah we have the very

2292
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:53,559
first registered pesticide light in

2293
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:56,039
United States yeah so um like about two

2294
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,760
years ago my father-in-law came across

2295
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:01,359
an abandoned patent from like the early

2296
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,159
2000s that gave us the right concept and

2297
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:05,198
we kind of started going down this

2298
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:07,599
rabbit hole and then well we started

2299
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:10,238
doing research on UVC and it's not like

2300
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:13,320
UVC is it's been common it's been used

2301
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:15,718
for years to like kill bugs and labs and

2302
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:17,719
all different types of stuff um it just

2303
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:19,800
hasn't been used the same way so we

2304
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:22,079
developed a we came up with a concept

2305
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,320
and there was one other company that was

2306
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:25,399
on the right track they had the right

2307
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:26,719
idea

2308
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:28,719
and the reason why you don't know who

2309
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,520
they are is they started well I'm

2310
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:33,679
positive that they started faking the

2311
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:35,800
research really yeah so like saying that

2312
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,319
the light is runs for this long and it

2313
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,719
will wipe out and do all the stuff and

2314
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:43,359
they started doing even studies showing

2315
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:45,079
pictures before and after and like you

2316
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:47,279
know you would think if it was truly

2317
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:48,960
true they would have [ __ ] blown up

2318
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,880
and then we realized like for the amount

2319
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,319
of time that they were using it like I

2320
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,800
started doing I bought their light I

2321
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:57,119
even tested it absolutely doesn't work

2322
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,560
what they were saying so we started um

2323
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:01,079
going down this rabbit hole and it's

2324
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,400
like it's a really it took us like a

2325
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:05,079
year of R&amp;D of trying all different

2326
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:07,238
types of diodes different wavelengths

2327
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:08,880
and all of a sudden on one of the tests

2328
01:20:07,238 --> 01:20:10,678
that we did it was just stupid well we

2329
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,199
started um I used to I don't know if you

2330
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:14,480
saw those posts we'd be making posts I'd

2331
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:16,158
be like anyone got spidermites who's got

2332
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:17,599
like I want spidermites I'd make post

2333
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,638
saying I want spidermites or I want

2334
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,639
thrips yeah and I started even working

2335
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:23,400
with someone that was even breeding them

2336
01:20:21,639 --> 01:20:24,679
and we were introducing I had four

2337
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:26,158
different people that were partic

2338
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:28,000
participating with us H was one of the

2339
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,479
people that you know floor that came on

2340
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,679
the showt he's awesome and then I was

2341
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:33,678
doing it with another lab um too that

2342
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:35,760
was participating so we we were

2343
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:38,158
introducing five to seven spider mites

2344
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,079
and we were beating them in seven days

2345
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:41,638
then we started introducing so like

2346
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:44,119
after the very first test I thought okay

2347
01:20:41,639 --> 01:20:46,239
well we can beat spider mites I thought

2348
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:48,079
we could because you introduced five to

2349
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:50,039
seven mites and we're beating them in

2350
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:51,600
within a week and then we started adding

2351
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:53,399
well on the very first test I added like

2352
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,639
over 200 and I've got this all Doc the

2353
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:55,638
footage document I'll be able to show

2354
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,600
show you here cuz I'm about to start

2355
01:20:55,639 --> 01:21:00,440
releasing this stuff yeah um and that we

2356
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,360
had like it had hundreds of eggs and

2357
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:04,158
after about 36 hours of them being

2358
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:07,039
established we started trading them we

2359
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:10,039
couldn't beat them but we could reduce

2360
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:12,519
their spread by over 95% and by like day

2361
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:14,198
21 they were still weren't even webbing

2362
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,400
and uh so it was just like a GameChanger

2363
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:17,919
for spidermites but at this point we

2364
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,119
we've evolved a lot since then like

2365
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,079
we're about to start doing a whole bunch

2366
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,639
of testing but I would still say it's

2367
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:25,519
like one like with what we were doing it

2368
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,880
was a straight up 95% protection like so

2369
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,480
basically if spidermites come in your

2370
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,840
room you're going to be in a 95% better

2371
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:32,638
situation if you don't beat them in the

2372
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:36,039
first week like if it's a serious

2373
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:37,920
infestation and then with um thrips um

2374
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:39,639
the same thing I had well we were doing

2375
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,000
like I I happen to have the very first

2376
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:43,400
day I got him I happen to get an

2377
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,679
unplanned infestation of thrips so it

2378
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:48,119
was just like the best uh thing and like

2379
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:51,399
I documented it and you know we're

2380
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:52,840
beating them by 97 to 98% and I'm like

2381
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:56,000
thinking hey this is absolutely

2382
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:58,400
incredible you in the top 30 plus inches

2383
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,079
like we cannot see a thrip and any of

2384
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,158
the thrips or anything you see is like

2385
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:04,359
out where the light is int treating so I

2386
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:05,879
thought this is incredible um now let's

2387
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:07,759
try using it to stress out the plant to

2388
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,319
get higher THC and tpping so we started

2389
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,039
doing two 15minute treatments six days

2390
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:15,039
later there were no [ __ ] thrips in

2391
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:16,560
the room completely [ __ ] gone and um

2392
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:17,960
there was a fellow from California

2393
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,880
Matthew Gates do you know who he is sink

2394
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:22,719
angel or I know that name yeah he's like

2395
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,119
I I consider him like he's just a really

2396
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:27,439
smart guy really knows IPM

2397
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:29,279
really well and uh we flew him out to

2398
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:31,279
see like hey can you to find a thri

2399
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:32,920
because I had been talking to him and he

2400
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,719
had seen what we were doing and like I

2401
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,359
just wanted him to see it and stuff and

2402
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,880
you know he can't he didn't see the

2403
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:40,039
whole crop but he could see the footage

2404
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,039
before and then to like while the thrips

2405
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:43,920
were alive and he came down for the end

2406
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:46,920
and they're not a living thrip and then

2407
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,600
we've done multiple tests by now and um

2408
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,000
it's yeah conclusive like thrips are a

2409
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:52,000
problem of the past we can beat him

2410
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,960
without pesticides or any type of

2411
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,479
Predator bug so in the light work you do

2412
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:00,079
treatments couple treatments a day it

2413
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:01,319
runs in the middle of Darkness oh wow it

2414
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:04,600
doesn't have to run in the middle of

2415
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:06,399
Darkness but um everything that I had

2416
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,719
done like for their research shows like

2417
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,759
bugs are attracted to light in the

2418
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:13,439
middle of darkness and it's not enough

2419
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:16,039
to wake it up so we we like we even have

2420
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,678
like over a year of using it like longer

2421
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:18,880
times at night time but you can

2422
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,760
definitely use it in the middle of the

2423
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,119
darkness is when we recommended if

2424
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,119
someone was nervous about it they could

2425
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:27,039
do it right after the light squo or

2426
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:30,439
right after after sure but yeah so it um

2427
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:33,119
so it also works to kill mildew and

2428
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:34,719
enhance THC and turpins really it's like

2429
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:36,399
it's like the ultimate you know what I

2430
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,760
mean it's sounds too good to be true

2431
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:39,599
sounds too good to be true I can't wait

2432
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:43,360
to see it yeah so like a lot of people

2433
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,000
use UVA and they put UVA in their lights

2434
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:48,119
we would never do it well first of all

2435
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,840
UVA the diodes don't last nearly as long

2436
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:51,960
right so when we have these souped out

2437
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,119
lights with all these fiveyear life

2438
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,198
dials we would never put UVA in the same

2439
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:58,439
fixture that doesn't last nearly as long

2440
01:23:56,198 --> 01:24:01,359
next to that I've seen tons of side by

2441
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:04,000
sides Over The Last 5 Years UVA versus

2442
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:07,000
not mhm at most we ever saw was a little

2443
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,079
over a 1% increase in THC with

2444
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,880
sacrificing turpins yeah so like it was

2445
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:14,359
never really that big I didn't think

2446
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,679
very much of it and then UVB on the

2447
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:20,319
other hand has a much higher efficacy

2448
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:23,158
than UVA so UVB is from 280 nanometer to

2449
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:25,399
3150 nanometer though any of those

2450
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:28,638
side-by-side tests that we saw there was

2451
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:32,439
a huge gain of 2 to 3% in tpin and 1 to

2452
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:35,159
2% or sorry 2 to 3% in THC and 1 to 2%

2453
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:37,678
inter turpine so um like you got UVA and

2454
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:40,519
then you've got UVB which has you know a

2455
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:43,560
way higher efficacy and then you got UVC

2456
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:45,719
100 to 280 this stuff causes cancer by

2457
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,400
the way like this that was why it was

2458
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:49,399
such a big deal to get this registered

2459
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:50,759
in the states right because you had to

2460
01:24:49,399 --> 01:24:54,079
go through all this different stuff with

2461
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:57,800
the EPA and uh which is not not an easy

2462
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:59,679
thing to do but um anyway so UVC has a

2463
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,800
much higher efficacy we also made an

2464
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:05,319
accidental Discovery when we had it on

2465
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:08,480
we had a room where a timer failed and

2466
01:25:05,319 --> 01:25:10,079
the light was on for 12 hours and it it

2467
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:12,959
[ __ ] up every part of the plant like

2468
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,559
so the the light was down by the stem

2469
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,279
and this is when we discovered that hey

2470
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:19,440
it's affected every part of the [ __ ]

2471
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:21,238
plant we can admit UV systemically into

2472
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:24,079
the plant through the bottom of the

2473
01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:25,399
plant to enhance THC and tpes nice and

2474
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:27,719
we couldn't there's no literature on

2475
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:29,319
this so we're going to be like it was an

2476
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,279
accidental Discovery I'm sure there's a

2477
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:33,158
lot of people are going to be messing

2478
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,479
around with this but uh it's it's pretty

2479
01:25:33,158 --> 01:25:37,479
incredible um so we don't even like with

2480
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:39,718
our lights and having our we call it the

2481
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:41,799
tantula Predator you don't need any UV

2482
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:43,279
supplement you have the ultimate UV

2483
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,159
that's working underneath your canopy

2484
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:47,559
that also protects you from mildew it's

2485
01:25:45,158 --> 01:25:49,118
not going to like be a cure for mildew

2486
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,080
because like you could technically kill

2487
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:52,839
mildew if you put it within like a

2488
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:54,559
certain distance sure but if you have

2489
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,760
something that's causing mildew right

2490
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,159
this Airborne it's like Well yeah if you

2491
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:00,880
got a problem it's not going to be a k

2492
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:03,079
like I've seen a mildew happen two two

2493
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,480
major reasons why it happens is like I

2494
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:06,559
see if someone doesn't have a room

2495
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:08,279
properly insulated and it gets cold and

2496
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,719
then hot and then it starts rotting in

2497
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:13,439
the wall or it just simply getting too

2498
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:15,399
cold with the humidity too high at night

2499
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:17,079
time right so like if you're doing that

2500
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:18,960
every single night we can't cure that

2501
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:21,519
problem if your VPD is not it correct

2502
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,639
but um but it definitely does work it

2503
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,840
just overall it's just such a

2504
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:26,760
Competitive Edge

2505
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,520
nice yeah and what kind of price are we

2506
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:33,239
looking at um to do a 4x4 area it's

2507
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:35,320
going to be 225 us nice yeah super

2508
01:26:33,238 --> 01:26:37,839
competitive yeah it's it's super

2509
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:41,238
reasonable um like we were working on a

2510
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,760
UVA UVA bar wall it's like already done

2511
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:45,359
uh just working on the certification but

2512
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:46,920
I was ready to abort it like we didn't

2513
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:50,719
it's a fluorescent bar that will attach

2514
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:52,440
to any fixture and we like we didn't use

2515
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:54,439
UVB diodes like there's a lot of other

2516
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:56,799
companies that are but the technology

2517
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:58,719
isn't really there yet when I say that

2518
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,600
like in a fluorescent bar it was 80%

2519
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:03,079
more efficient yeah so you're getting

2520
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,480
80% more light per watt because I'm

2521
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:06,880
using in a fluorescent so that's why we

2522
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:08,399
went in that direction but with the UVC

2523
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,639
in our Predator like I'm pretty much

2524
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:12,359
going to abort it because what's the

2525
01:27:09,639 --> 01:27:15,400
point of having UVB and UVA when you got

2526
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:17,359
UVC right and what's also cool about it

2527
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:19,399
you can get it anywhere in your canopy

2528
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:21,719
like the lights they float but they spin

2529
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:23,238
360° and you could move them up anywhere

2530
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:25,760
in your canopy if you wanted it up by

2531
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:27,198
your upper flower and like um I know

2532
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,679
it's kind of hard to visualize but

2533
01:27:27,198 --> 01:27:32,399
basically when you have clones they go

2534
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:34,000
above pointing down mhm at your clones

2535
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:35,759
nice and it's also for like someone like

2536
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,238
you that has genetics yeah it's a

2537
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,760
[ __ ] GameChanger for your mother

2538
01:27:37,238 --> 01:27:41,319
rooms like because you can't have to the

2539
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,239
more you have the better the more

2540
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:44,960
coverage you have so like for me

2541
01:27:43,238 --> 01:27:47,039
personally if I had any type of genetics

2542
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,359
or any type of breeding my mother rooms

2543
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,079
would be covered in them just because

2544
01:27:48,359 --> 01:27:52,519
it's the ultimate protection like can't

2545
01:27:51,079 --> 01:27:54,198
um like we haven't got to test it like

2546
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:56,400
we're working with a major you

2547
01:27:54,198 --> 01:27:59,638
University um with like a with the dean

2548
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,039
of a major university I I can't say yet

2549
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:03,159
but once it's everything is published

2550
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:04,359
they're assisting with the white papers

2551
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:06,238
and uh we're so we're going to have all

2552
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:08,839
the science behind it and like I believe

2553
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:11,238
it's going to work on everything to be

2554
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:12,520
quite honest like russet mes I broad

2555
01:28:11,238 --> 01:28:13,959
mites I think it will work on everything

2556
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,480
like it's so effective that's such a

2557
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,800
game changer too because russed mites

2558
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:18,799
and Broad mites is they're a pain in the

2559
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,039
ass I mean you can use M microle

2560
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:24,760
disperse and sulfur for Russ mites and

2561
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:26,279
Broad Ms to a degree but there it's not

2562
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,119
easy to get rid of and then all of a

2563
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:30,559
sudden you're spraying sulfur on your

2564
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:32,279
plant now you can't use it for extra

2565
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,880
right smoking sulfur you don't want to

2566
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:38,399
smoke sulfur oh it's so yeah sulfur is

2567
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:40,960
such a yeah it's it's such a like we see

2568
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:42,198
it with the potential to end pesticides

2569
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,158
on food crops well it's like the

2570
01:28:42,198 --> 01:28:47,638
ultimate IPM right so like really it's

2571
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:49,960
the most safe method of uh Pest

2572
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:52,560
Management on the planet yeah and like I

2573
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:54,239
said we were doing well against spider

2574
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,239
mins but that was a 10-minute treatment

2575
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,279
I haven't tried two 15minute treatments

2576
01:28:56,238 --> 01:29:00,158
yet on them so like we might be able to

2577
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:02,800
beat spider mites the same way we might

2578
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:04,198
be able to beat thrips um but we already

2579
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,199
know it's so effective there's no we

2580
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:07,559
can't hold it back anymore like it's and

2581
01:29:06,198 --> 01:29:09,158
it's well it's right like we literally

2582
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,360
have it leaving for the USA at the end

2583
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:13,719
of this week um really cool yeah so

2584
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:15,519
anyways yeah have to get some of them

2585
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:17,079
for the facility oh definitely like I

2586
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,840
said it's a a game changer especially

2587
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:21,800
for someone like you that's got genetics

2588
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:24,719
yeah no that sounds awesome yeah good

2589
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:28,520
stuff well if you had one piece of

2590
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:30,760
advice for your younger self coming into

2591
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:32,639
the industry with all the experience

2592
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:35,960
that you have now what would that

2593
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:37,319
be um well I definitely would like I

2594
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,679
definitely wouldn't have acted as

2595
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:42,399
unprofessional as I did in some cases

2596
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,279
like going back like uh like this is CRA

2597
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,039
I'm crazy conservative the last two

2598
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:48,359
years that you've known me go back like

2599
01:29:46,039 --> 01:29:50,039
a couple more years and I what you could

2600
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:53,399
consider me as a hotthead or would speak

2601
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:56,000
out or I'd be canceled for sure yeah you

2602
01:29:53,399 --> 01:29:59,439
know just like like uh so I would say

2603
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,719
being conservative like never um well I

2604
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:02,479
think the ability to know if you have a

2605
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:05,439
bad if something's not working out you

2606
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:07,479
have to abort or reconfigure and move

2607
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:09,319
forward and I'm being able to see that

2608
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:11,718
or pull the plug and start something new

2609
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:15,238
I think is a one of my biggest pieces of

2610
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:16,800
advice I could have nice yeah people are

2611
