you're here we've done this before on

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:30,039
the James loud show back in the day and

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,960
we've known each other for quite a while

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,480
we met through Jay before he passed over

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
a finest you guys were doing big things

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,398
yeah yeah it was it was a fun time with

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,558
him incredible person he was a valuable

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,759
contribution to the industry and and

16
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,878
just loved the plant loved weed he he

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,679
was yeah he was amazing and it's you he

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,960
would be in disbelief on some of the

19
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,558
things in the industry and other things

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,039
he'd be excited about so yeah yeah but

21
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,959
yeah and then you grew out some genetics

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,439
of mine back back in the day yeah yeah

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,960
back in the day at sour I remember

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,759
growing that for a while uh you know we

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,840
had a lot of in the 215 we had a lot of

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,359
sour heads and and not everyone wanted

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,520
to wait for you know 10 12 weeks strain

28
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,560
and the 78 sour had the the sour smell

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,079
it had the the structure and stuff and

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,478
did really well with that for a while

31
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,000
you had that nose burn that yeah you

32
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,560
just don't you don't get stuff like that

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,759
anymore I people don't well I think for

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
a while people didn't appreciate the

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,439
sour and then all of a sudden people

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,680
just want to purple

37
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,438
I think weed is is starting to become

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,240
like a fashion it's starting to become

39
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,879
cyclical yeah you know and to see you

40
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,839
know a lot of old stuff kind of coming

41
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,078
back you know like a lot of the new

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,680
generation whether just you know smokers

43
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:48,679
or or people in the industry haven't

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,240
seen a lot of the stuff that we we you

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,960
know grew in the past and and and got to

46
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,920
like and it's fun for that in the

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,559
industry being on the genetic side like

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,159
seeing you know seeing some of the stuff

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,519
come back totally I I just it's funny

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,000
yeah it's almost this algic some of

51
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,920
these smells that I've been smelled for

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,200
20 years and I smell it's like

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
unmistakable that it has this in it you

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,520
know whether it's the real thing or it's

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,400
a derivative of it you know it's great

56
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,280
you were talking about Urkel earlier

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,719
smelling something with Urkel in it and

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
it's like I love that where it's like

59
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,239
you smell it you're like [Â __Â ] that's got

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,560
Urkel in it or it is Urkel you know I've

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,680
I've seen both KKL Urkel's been going

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,120
around again as well yeah yeah that's

63
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,200
one of those ones that'll never

64
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,599
completely go away I hope yeah I mean I

65
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,679
think you know like you hit the nail on

66
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,560
the head that's nostalgic like for me

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,319
like when I've smelt some of these like

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,280
you know you brought me a super super

69
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:39,280
silver haze a couple couple weeks ago

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,039
and I was like you know like it it kind

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,640
of triggers a a memory or emotion you

72
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,719
know um for me A lot of times and like

73
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,439
it'll put me back into a a place and you

74
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,919
know it's it's special it's you know

75
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,840
breeding on the breeding side like with

76
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,318
the Urkel like I smell things and I was

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,840
like oo I want to try to pull that back

78
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:00,318
out deep you know Funk and you know like

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,519
purples nowadays like you look at the

80
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,839
color but like purple's like had a smell

81
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,200
too you know 12 15 years agic yeah I

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,840
mean before GDP was URL and it had that

83
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,878
very floral what you think of Purple

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,158
weed smelling like that's that's it it's

85
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,919
in there yeah and yeah it was it was a

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,878
good one didn't yield the best no still

87
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,039
doesn't but yeah I mean for as far as

88
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,000
expression it's it's amazing um I like

89
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,400
GDP too GDP is another one I don't like

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,280
grow GDP I I've complained about it on

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,519
the show many times about long it takes

92
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,158
to veg but the flower smoking GDP I like

93
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,959
the taste I think it's great heavy

94
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,519
hitter heavy hitter it's got that floral

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,840
like overtone almost and then it's

96
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,200
complex yeah it's interesting how it's

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,120
changed over the years with genetics

98
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,560
where there was a point where you

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,239
couldn't even sell purple to save your

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,759
life and then it went green and you know

101
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,239
and then cookies kind of brought the

102
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,719
purple back in the the color back into

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,239
it and then it evolves with gelato again

104
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,000
and then they said yeah let's get rid of

105
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,878
all the green stuff I remember some of

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,239
the first you know I think we've talked

107
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,318
about this in the past but like some of

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
the first breeding books I read yeah

109
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,399
like you know that was a recessive trait

110
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,598
wanted to actually select and get that

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,199
out of there you know and it's funny to

112
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:19,238
see because you know in the old days I

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,360
think the purples you know probably

114
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,159
weren't as strong you know and you know

115
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,840
nowadays like we you know definitely the

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,240
evolution people have you know got it

117
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,198
stronger and and you know frostier and

118
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,519
stuff like that but yeah I mean when I

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,919
first started doing selections and

120
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,839
breeding like was a recessive trait you

121
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,680
wanted to yank that out of there yeah

122
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,959
it's it's funny how it's so subjective

123
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,759
and flavor is so subjective and color is

124
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,560
so subjective to the individual and it's

125
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,600
it's funny how there's actually wheight

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
put on the color of it when it's

127
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,320
something that's supposed to be you're

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,079
you're looking for a flavor and effect

129
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,199
but you know people eat with their eyes

130
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,000
yeah whether it's food or whatever but

131
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,520
it's interesting cuz my friend just

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,079
passed recently and there's a couple

133
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,639
things I've been reflecting on his

134
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,758
memorial service was last Saturday and

135
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,199
his son and daughter basically made me

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,439
the steward of his seed collection and I

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,319
was going through the seed collection I

138
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,800
found seeds I gave him 10 years ago you

139
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,399
know so the the value of seeds are in

140
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,720
their use and not in their possession

141
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,839
sure and I'm sure there's tons of people

142
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,560
have given seeds to you that have a

143
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,079
gerum and so many people have given me

144
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,680
seeds that I have in germinated and it's

145
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:34,198
it's really a trip with that but he was

146
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,600
so heavily focused on Flavor over the

147
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,120
last month since he passed on 420 I've

148
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000
been you know reflecting on the

149
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,840
importance of effect I've been focused

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,399
on Flavor heavily focused on Flavor as a

151
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,239
chef I'm all like Flavor Flavor Flavor

152
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,799
and so effect has kind of gotten

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,519
sidelined a little bit I mean of course

154
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,478
I want to feel good when I take it and I

155
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,839
talk about effect but I think it should

156
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,478
be prioritized to a certain degree this

157
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,879
white Thorn Rose that's that's popular

158
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,839
now and if you have a chance to to get

159
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,038
it it's an amazing thing to try it has

160
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,399
an amazing effect even beyond the fact

161
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:08,839
that it's purple rosin and purple flow I

162
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,478
mean that's cool but the effect is it's

163
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,279
feel-good wheat at the end of the day it

164
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,359
makes you feel great you smoke it you're

165
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,239
like wow I feel good I could take on the

166
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,160
world it's not going to have that

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,759
narcotic effect that some people are

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,759
looking for it's not going to have that

169
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
crazy sativa effect but it has this

170
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,400
calming out almost but like makes me

171
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,598
feel really good yeah enough on my rat

172
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,239
uh what do you breed for a lot of Tarpin

173
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:35,478
you know the effect as well to like you

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,879
know I've always tried to to to look at

175
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,918
it as like something that I want to

176
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,560
smoke yeah you know I grew up in New

177
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,959
York so I I love gas uh I don't think

178
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,918
that's ever going to come out of me but

179
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,758
I do love I love the fruit you know the

180
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,680
last couple rounds I've been breeding

181
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,240
for for hash I have a couple Farms up in

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,079
Nevada County and for the last couple

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
years I've been breeding for hash and

184
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,959
selections for hash and you know like

185
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,960
with the state of the industry it's

186
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,959
tough for some of the smaller Mom and

187
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,279
Pops you know like I know there's always

188
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,000
the the back and forth of is it indoor

189
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,399
better is it outdoor better you know it

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,959
but like I think there's a whole

191
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:15,120
community that has been growing some

192
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,038
amazing stuff under you know light PES

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,000
and been doing a lot of selections for

194
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,240
for for things like that to get into

195
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,120
people's hands and and the whole hash

196
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,120
lines and stuff like that so I feel like

197
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,598
a lot of the profiles I've been you know

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,360
everyone's kind of playing in this one

199
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:29,878
little area I've been trying to get out

200
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,720
of that area you know like a lot of the

201
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,280
GMOs a lot of the papayas and stuff like

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,440
that like I want to explore and try to

203
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,519
get some bigger yields hash yields and

204
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,120
and just have some new you know new

205
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,359
profiles so I've been kind of focusing

206
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,519
on that for the last couple years not to

207
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,280
say that I'm not you know breeding for

208
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,079
for flower as well too but that's kind

209
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,519
of been yeah you know a little niche

210
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,918
that I've been trying to hit and you're

211
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,719
doing your selection in Greenhouse for

212
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,639
the most part yeah I don't have an

213
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,680
indoor right now so I kind of rely on

214
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,960
you know some indoor Partners prefer

215
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,240
Garden's been working with David for for

216
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,158
years now nice he does a lot of

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,478
selections for me and you know like I

218
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:09,319
always try to get it into multiple

219
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,279
people's hands to see if I'm right or

220
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,598
wrong and you know like I think you know

221
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,719
our pallet sometimes you know for me I

222
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,478
lend towards a gas and you know not

223
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,319
everyone wants the gas right now too so

224
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,240
um you know part of it is also once I do

225
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,598
the selections we put in in tissue

226
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
culture and get it out to the masses so

227
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,478
it's you know like I need multiple

228
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,639
validations I also work closely with

229
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:33,598
Anna from cam you know she's running a

230
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,360
lot of the indoor stuff as as well as

231
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,919
some other smaller indoor Partners in

232
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,879
Sacramento as well really cool yeah yeah

233
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,799
I think the more data you know from the

234
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,639
nursery side of things the more data I

235
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,399
can get to the cultivators and and hand

236
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,120
it over the more successful they're

237
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,120
going to be with with the plants with

238
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,639
the strains that we're putting out so

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,639
data on when to harvest data on this

240
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:59,120
plants never fit in a box and you know

241
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,480
with crop steering and stuff now like i'

242
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
I've seen some strains that you know

243
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,039
they like to be pushed a lot harder in

244
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,200
veg and you know like they don't like

245
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,360
the EC stacking as much so it's like you

246
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,360
know the more data I can get on the

247
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,200
specific cultivar you know I'm trying to

248
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,039
kind of package that and give that to

249
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,399
cultivators so that you know they have a

250
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,759
better you know Head Start yeah I think

251
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,720
that's the future is is more data I mean

252
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,120
we're doing data driven breeding we're I

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,120
think before it was like we pop a bunch

254
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,839
of stuff and we do our selections now a

255
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,600
lot of us are taking notes and a lot of

256
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,399
us are logging data and trying to

257
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,839
capture as much of that as possible so

258
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,440
that we get better results in the future

259
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,959
yeah and more you know your lines the

260
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,959
better you know it's a yeah I have a a

261
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,599
background in computer science data

262
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,599
collection's always been big for me even

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,800
like the old 215 you know like I had

264
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,839
things stored you know encrypted and

265
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,519
secured so you know in case the door

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,680
ever got knocked down like I wouldn't

267
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,639
lose that stuff you know so I think it's

268
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,239
now it's more important than ever like

269
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,600
you know the the cultivators really rely

270
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,720
on the nurseries and you know every

271
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,399
Nursery has hurt some of the cultivators

272
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,200
and it's when everyone goes to scale

273
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,759
there's bumps and bruises you know like

274
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,278
there's been no book written to do this

275
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,879
you know so it's just we're all learning

276
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,159
and the more that we can you know give

277
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,519
the cultivators a head start I think you

278
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,000
know that's what I'm really trying to

279
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,200
focus on on the breeding aspect of it

280
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,320
and the data collection totally no

281
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,759
that's awesome and you're working with

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,160
Conception 2 you guys are doing big

283
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,278
things over there some World Class

284
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,000
People people you know Kevin had a a

285
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,278
good vision and me and him you know kind

286
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,078
of shared shared the the same idea the

287
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,039
same vision we bring in a lot of

288
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:43,278
breeders that you know everything on the

289
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,480
menu is actually paid royalties to a

290
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,278
breeder which is unique if the Breeders

291
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,240
are actually getting reimbursed for

292
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,519
their work and and you know they're

293
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,120
they're more driven for Innovation and

294
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,519
you know if they can focus on what they

295
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,320
do great and getting money for that and

296
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,360
keeping them in their Lane you know

297
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,160
there's going to be more and more

298
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,759
Innovation uh in this industry and

299
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:08,078
hopefully we get out of this this box of

300
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,639
you know purple purple G or candy I

301
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,439
should say and you know like you know I

302
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,079
think the the markets you know like you

303
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,760
look at the other markets that have you

304
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,120
know come and matured and you know it's

305
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,120
more about tpine profiles and effects

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,959
and stuff so hopefully the industry

307
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,679
starts catching up and well the spray

308
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,599
tur box is in the right direction let me

309
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,399
tell you that's it's comedy though but

310
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,800
people are buying it unfortunately

311
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,078
people are but people buy Vape carts too

312
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,838
so I mean it it is what it is but I feel

313
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,638
like the breeding is going to go in

314
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,440
other directions I'm already seen it I

315
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,440
see a lot of people talking about sativa

316
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
you know we've been talking about how

317
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,320
SAU and OG are making a comeback and

318
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,039
they will they definitely will there's a

319
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,120
lot of people that want them and if it's

320
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:52,319
not the original sour it'll be a sour

321
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,200
Cross or OG cross there's a lot of good

322
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,760
OG crosses out there yeah and there's

323
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,720
even purple gas that's out there That's

324
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,039
Heavy

325
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,000
Gas so it's just Evolution so it is

326
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,958
exciting I'm always excited to find new

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
stuff like that we haven't seen before

328
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,799
yeah rhubarb I'm looking for some

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
rhubarb stuff like that you know I mean

330
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,679
nostalgic things that I think of when I

331
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,839
was a kid you know it's like pancakes is

332
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,319
pretty cool yeah for because it smells

333
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,959
like pancake I remember the first time I

334
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,879
saw chocolate thae yeah it really smelt

335
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,759
like chocolate you know it was on the on

336
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,399
the stick and it was wrapped up for me

337
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,439
like you know I grew up on brick you

338
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,639
know Mexican brick weed yeah we started

339
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,399
getting some of the DC Bud uh the beers

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
we moved a lot of that remember the

341
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,919
first time I saw purple weed actually

342
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,759
and I was looking at animation jar being

343
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,439
like I didn't know that bud could look

344
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,399
like that you know and then seeing

345
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,760
chocolate Thai stick it was that was

346
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,000
like mind-blowing to me yeah you know so

347
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,759
it never smelted anything like it right

348
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
still hav to this day still still

349
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,559
searching still searching for that Mak

350
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,240
it come back yeah I feel like there's

351
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,479
some interesting chocolate crosses out

352
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,278
there the choc L is there was that

353
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,680
chocolate hashberry back in the day that

354
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,679
was kind of chocolatey but that wasn't

355
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,479
super chocy yeah and same thing with

356
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,120
chocol up is it it has a hint of

357
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,278
chocolate so but yeah and these things

358
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,039
will reoccur the Gen genetic

359
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,958
recombination will provide those

360
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,198
genetics again at some point those

361
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,958
unique traits so you do seed production

362
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,559
too and you make seeds you make a bunch

363
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,679
of seeds and crosses and yeah we just I

364
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,439
did a a collaboration with jock at

365
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,638
spannabis this year with turog took the

366
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,920
original Skittle more like half Focus

367
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,639
line cross that to a bunch of stuff

368
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:36,559
we're finding some amazing penos out of

369
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,639
that yeah found a couple that are

370
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,439
pressing at like over 5% with you know a

371
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,919
Skittle guava kind of like a rotten

372
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,240
Skittle smell um yeah yeah doing seed

373
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:49,759
production released another line a reg

374
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,440
line with farming Stone another hash

375
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,039
line great line like OG gz cross to

376
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,079
papaya rainbow belts and another whole

377
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:02,679
line that I was doing Skittles uh Hindu

378
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:05,078
Skittles papaya CR hind Skittles really

379
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:08,638
maybe I had a good one that's totally

380
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,319
possible you know I feel like bagging on

381
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,799
strange stuff because maybe it wasn't

382
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,440
grown by the right person or maybe it it

383
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,679
is good and I didn't get the right cut

384
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,480
or even the same cut yeah even the same

385
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,559
cross yeah my experience with Hindu

386
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,159
Skittles I got excited and I was in a

387
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,000
dispenser and I bought two bags of it

388
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,559
because it was like buy one get one free

389
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,159
and it was Hindu Skittles I'm like dude

390
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,758
it's got to be amazing and it just

391
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,360
wasn't skitt

392
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,800
is it flour or rosin okay yeah I've had

393
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,560
a really more in rosin yeah makes it

394
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:41,639
makes Candy Funk it's got like some

395
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:45,000
raunchiness like they did the uh Hindu

396
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,959
Skittles papaya it was like rotten fruit

397
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,120
yeah I hit that to a couple I hit it to

398
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,919
the fatso I hit it to the zods I hit it

399
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,000
to a couple different things blueberry

400
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:56,679
thint which I'm calling blue

401
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,519
Andes um and it's given a lot of depth

402
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,319
of flavor yeah Skittles crosses are

403
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,839
tricky you know breeding with Skittles

404
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,680
is chicky I think there's a lot of

405
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,320
recessive traits then if you breed stuff

406
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,078
and you want Skittles you're looking for

407
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,120
the structure that's not as good it's a

408
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,120
hard turpine to pull out yeah that candy

409
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,198
in there and then we had some Skittles

410
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,198
back crosses that leaned heavy on the

411
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,958
CBG flow Gardens just got some coas done

412
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:22,758
nice it was like some ridiculous amount

413
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:25,679
of CVG so I'm excited to try some of

414
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,320
that flower out nice yeah sounds good I

415
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,799
I like Skittles I like yeah I mean I

416
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,278
like candy I like flavor but Skittles is

417
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,120
special yeah I've always you know like

418
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,278
in the old days it was always like the

419
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,560
nose sold the bag so you know I've been

420
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,159
doing a lot of selections based off of

421
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,399
loud Tarpin profiles some of the

422
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,879
breeding that's done now are the

423
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,879
selections like feel like we lost it

424
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,318
becomes you know a little monot turp or

425
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,559
you know a little more it's R

426
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,759
weed sorry for interrupting but yeah

427
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,439
Instagram is run weed it's that that

428
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,800
monot turp and all those thing as far as

429
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,680
why the flour isn't as good I think a

430
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,120
lot of it is social media because you

431
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,359
don't actually have to smell it you

432
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,399
don't actually have to taste it or or

433
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,919
feel the effect of it you look at it and

434
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,000
a lot of people are basing the quality

435
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,240
on and you know some of that stuff looks

436
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,440
amazing and it just doesn't smell yeah

437
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,198
so much of it yeah no I think you're

438
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,720
right that's where the marketing side

439
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:24,958
comes in um I think that's where

440
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,040
California kind of went wrong too I miss

441
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,518
like opening a jar at a dispensary and

442
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,198
smelling it right you know and and now

443
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,198
it's like I've seen a lot of people with

444
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,399
the push tops and it you know kind of

445
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,439
pushes it to you but like the weed sits

446
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,839
on that jar for for months I'm sure you

447
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,639
lose that you know like some of the

448
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,480
other someone just told me that Oregon

449
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,839
still does the deli you know like you

450
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,120
still pop it open they pull it out and

451
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,839
package it there for you so really cool

452
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,000
that's how it should be I mean I think

453
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,000
there's a freshness involved and if you

454
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,318
use the freshness of the product it's

455
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,039
like just like anything no one likes D

456
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,519
old bread or stale bread no I guess one

457
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,958
bread stays Fresher a lot longer but

458
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,400
sure a lot of preservatives exactly but

459
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,318
yeah it's interesting these different

460
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,360
markets and then New York expanding and

461
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:12,000
doing their thing and I think it's great

462
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,240
they have their own set of problems yeah

463
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,558
yeah it was funny I I went out there two

464
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,798
420s ago and I grew up there and you

465
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:23,359
know New York is weed has been in the

466
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,400
culture in New York for for as long as

467
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,318
I've been alive you know and I was

468
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,600
excited you know I was in Washington

469
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,960
Square Park for everybody and and seeing

470
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,159
you know just everyone coming together

471
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,240
and stuff like that but you know they

472
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,240
have the same problem that you know Los

473
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Angeles dealt with with the lacka moles

474
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,679
you know like they take out one you know

475
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,960
legal dispensary and three more pop up

476
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,679
so they're going to have their you know

477
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,038
they're going to have some some Growing

478
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,960
Pains I do think it's going to be one

479
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,759
you know if you look at sales volume I

480
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,159
think it'll be you know one of the top

481
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,000
for sales for for the country like I

482
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,960
said everyone everyone loves it there we

483
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,359
have some seed that are over there now

484
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
and they'll be doing some marketing at

485
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,240
the end of the summer flying out there

486
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,000
looking at some some strains we have

487
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,880
working with a group out there that

488
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,240
they're planting like six or seven acres

489
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,400
between a couple different areas cool

490
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,880
one of the one of the Farms is right

491
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,159
where I grew up so um probably 15 20

492
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,640
minutes from where I grew up so wow I'm

493
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,240
excited to see it there yeah I just it's

494
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,038
it's interesting and I can't wait for

495
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,599
interstate commerce yeah I think that's

496
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,679
just I mean for what you guys are doing

497
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,038
in conception and for what we're doing

498
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,080
and it's it's going to be just such a

499
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,839
big game Cher when it opens up and you

500
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,158
know there's all these loopholes now

501
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,839
that you know I think those loopholes

502
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,400
will go away eventually but they they

503
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,839
need to have it done so we can do it the

504
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,679
right way where there will be Interstate

505
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,839
comers where cultivators will be sell

506
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,480
able to sell to other states yeah I mean

507
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,399
that's just silly that you can't go to

508
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,200
New York and buy California weed legally

509
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,320
you should be able to just like any

510
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,880
other Agricultural Product or anything

511
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,798
you buy in the grocery store the

512
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
rescheduling is not exactly what we want

513
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,558
but I think it's a step in the right

514
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,359
direction and hopefully like you know we

515
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,639
got to keep pushing and and trying to

516
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,038
make it better but I think it is you

517
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,360
know at least a step in the right

518
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,279
direction I haven't had the chance to

519
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,879
read the the full you know bylaws that

520
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,519
were just passed this morning yeah this

521
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,880
morning I guess they released it I saw

522
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,158
Omar figuroa posted about it but yeah

523
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,120
and then we have a the opportunity to

524
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,760
comment on it for the next few months

525
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,839
yeah 90 days I think it's something

526
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,640
that's got to it's got to happen I mean

527
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:36,119
it's it's got to happen and schedule 3's

528
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,679
you know people are like man we just any

529
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,599
step is a good step I feel I I really

530
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,200
pref I think I think it should be

531
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,599
descheduled 100% but at the same time we

532
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,319
need to move

533
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,199
forward um you know and I think there's

534
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,319
a there's a lot of people fighting for

535
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,480
what what's right so we'll see what

536
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,158
happens yeah I hope that it really opens

537
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,960
up you know like interstate comence

538
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,240
you know like I think we have an over

539
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,240
Supply issue in in in California and it

540
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,440
needs to be addressed and it's not why

541
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,079
it doesn't get better with age so no

542
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,840
keep the supply coming turn it on into

543
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:14,480
Raz and then you get freeze

544
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,558
it I mean really extract is the only

545
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,519
thing to do when you have an over supply

546
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,440
of product unfortunately since we can't

547
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,960
sell it to other states yeah but Oregon

548
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,440
has the same thing they produce some

549
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,038
ridiculous amount more than they can

550
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,600
consume I know they were trying to push

551
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:29,879
an envelope for a while trying to open

552
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,599
up interstate commerce between you know

553
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,320
a couple other states and I think the

554
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:37,038
whole CBD the whole farm bill has really

555
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,798
pushed the rescheduling or you know

556
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,200
these whole talks because it's it's

557
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:44,200
really cats out of the bag and and they

558
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,279
need to figure out how to you know

559
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,919
control a little bit better and and you

560
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,879
know create a little bit more of a

561
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,960
thriving economy off of it you know for

562
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
sure so what's the new hottest latest

563
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
greatest thing in conception there's a

564
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,360
bunch as far as like the candy levers

565
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,039
there's a a Lemon Cherry sherbet nice

566
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:05,000
it's a collaboration between Tiki madman

567
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:07,200
and Mario from shinsky nice so it's the

568
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,278
Lemon Cherry gelato cross original

569
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,840
Sunset sherbet I love the sunset sherbet

570
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:14,359

571
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,000

the you know like sherber came out kind

574
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,079

575
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,759
Skittles came you know and Skittles kind

576
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,839
of blew up for a second and it was like

577
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,640
a real quick rush into the gelados and

578
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,839
then the gelato took over and that was

579
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,679
it yeah yeah I mean sher's special so I

580

582
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,080
pretty good the purple on it's amazing

share you know it's it's fair day and

586
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,599
yeah I remember that whole thing very

587
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,080
vividly from the from the Bay Area and

588
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:55,278
it's like sure was was killing still is

589
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,798
it is it is so yeah I'm excited for that

590
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,079
one you know I've been working with

591
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,440
Mario for for years now and i' remember

592
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,678
the original Sunset sherbet I had got 10

593
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,400
years ago or something but I grew it for

594
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,400
a long time and and vended a lot across

595
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,960
California and then started working with

596
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,600
him a couple years after that and then

597
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,640
got to grow the real one I was like oh

598
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,558
man I've never never had the real one

599
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,080
you know like it's so loud and it's I

600
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,599
like that funk that really has yeah

601
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:27,599
that's that's one of the new ones I have

602
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,678
a blueberry hen Min so it was honestly

603
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,480
it was like two of the original strains

604
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,038
that like I brought through tissue

605
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,919
culture the original thin Min uh I had

606
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:38,879
gotten from a friend early on it wasn't

607
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,880
even called cookies yet it wasn't even

608
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,960
called you know came to me as a cosmic

609
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,880
or something like that and I remember

610
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,240
growing it at that time I was growing a

611
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,880
lot of sours and ogs and I remember

612
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,599
growing it and like looking at it just

613
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,120
being like freaking out being like this

614
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:55,439
isn't going to yield anything you know

615
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,199
and it was you know golf balls all the

616
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,519
way up dry it fast forward trimmers are

617
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,480
trim come inside and there's like you

618
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,240
know bags like this big I was like is

619
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,558
this a quter pound is this half pound

620
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,640
like what is this I like no that's a

621
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:11,519
full pound you know and I think the the

622
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,600
Girl Scout was like such a game changer

623
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,200
you know from what we were growing that

624
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,639
hit the market and everyone was just

625
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,000
like wow at that point I was living in

626
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,679
up in Lake Tahoe in trucky yeah you know

627
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,839
like we were growing in the garage and

628
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,840
there was before like you know AC

629
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,439
systems and stuff like that I used to

630
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:33,839
drag cold air from from we'd run the

631
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
lights at night drag it through the the

632
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,439
garage and suck it out the other end and

633
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,360
and I mean it would it would come out

634
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,679
black yeah and did you have like hoods

635
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,278
that had air flow through yeah we

636
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,360
started six Ines the fours yeah right

637
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,720
those are great hoods like I mean I

638
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,639
actually like looking back now like I

639
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,880
pulled some really great numbers off of

640
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,120
those Hood even going through glass and

641
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,080
and stuff like we had cool tubes that

642
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,839
was

643
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,639
yeah we did vertical growing with the

644
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,558
cool tubes you know I mean interesting

645
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,120
ways of do it back before we had real

646
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,599
before Mini Splits right that Mini

647
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,479
Splits were such a game changer I

648
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,879
remember we started putting Reams I

649
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,079
don't remember who came up with the idea

650
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,039
but we're just like let's just stick a

651
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,839
ream you know like home you know system

652
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:21,640
into the into the garage and started

653
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,199
cooling that way and that's when you

654
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,159
know you saw the big jump from from the

655
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,880
lights like gab started showing up and

656
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,640
stuff like that and we're like can't

657
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,840
cool this you know like we got to figure

658
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,919
something out yeah Reams came along and

659
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,720
and yeah the rest of History yeah it's

660
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,520
interesting these evolutions and femin

661
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,679
seeds I fought back on a bunch of stuff

662
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,079
like femin seeds I was like n you can't

663
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,519
do femin seeds it's going to ruin the

664
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:47,558
genan pool right you know and then utof

665
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,839
flowers I was very against autoflowers

666
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:50,519
in the beginning I was like aut there

667
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,000
were some bad ones at the beginning dude

668
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,679
there were some bad ones 10 years ago 15

669
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,440
years ago it was like I saw them and I'm

670
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,519
like I'm never growing autof flowers

671
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,360
ever yeah then my buddy Nick showed me a

672
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,398
greenhous full of autof flowers and I

673
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,558
couldn't believe that they're autof

674
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:10,038
flowers yeah like amazing and the blur

675
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,038
the purple LS like I nobody that grew

676
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,158
good ever used those though in in my

677
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:15,720
opinion I at least the circle of friends

678
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,919
that I had like everybody that wanted to

679
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,880
show me their blurp it was like dude

680
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,679
terrible weed and I'm like never I'm not

681
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,120
using because that's at the time I was

682
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,559
like oh that's LED I don't want to use

683
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,798
LED like HPS or CM I like C MH they used

684
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,000
a checkerboard with C too yeah I think

685
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,240
that's a great way to do it I think you

686
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,640
get amazing flavor but it's funny how

687
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,038
like blue dream grows better under HPS

688
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,200
than CMH I feel like the expression is

689
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,558
better it can handle the heat more too

690
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,319
so that blue dream used to grow like

691
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,879
crazy yeah yeah and I mean you have it

692
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,200
seems now like so many people are are

693
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,919
still talking about the single-ended you

694
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,640
know bulbs like you know like the the

695
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,159
double ender for like the some of the

696
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,640
connoisseurs they they don't want to

697
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,840
still you know they still think that

698
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,960
that was the best you know best weed

699
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,480
that they ever smoked yeah well I heard

700
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,880
OG girls really good in her CMH like

701
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,120
that's the one to grow makes sense I

702
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,520
guess the light intensity is not as not

703
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:15,839
as you know intense I guess pbfs are

704
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,240
probably lower and C hes right probably

705
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,240
yeah I mean that's probably why does

706
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,798
better yeah I always F like I mean the

707
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,240
ogs always just grew better Outdoors for

708
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:28,359
me I couldn't I couldn't Jay was great

709
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,200
at growing ogs and in inside I always

710
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,319
always like to put the ogs outside I

711
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,159
love good outdoor and so I forget for

712
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,439
for periods of time and then I get some

713
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,640
good outdoor and like I love really good

714
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,798
outdoor like the effect also the flavor

715
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,880
and I feel like the the rich flavor of a

716
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,720
good outdoor like good OG that's been

717
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,840
grown Outdoors where it's got that gas

718
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,440
that's just down to the roach not that

719
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,918
indoor OG is bad indoor OG is freaking

720
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,480
amazing yeah you know it's like Brian

721
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,520
vital you know his OG's fire that stuff

722
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,360
is amazing and I love I love that stuff

723
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:04,079
but good OG that's been grown Outdoors

724
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,240
most outdoor flow grown correctly is

725
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,240
good yeah but there's that 1% of stuff

726
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,200
where it's like yeah that white Thorn

727
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Rose is another one it's like sunr the

728
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,000
The Taste is really good it has the nice

729
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,798
it has like a florish

730
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,839
rose like vanilla and almond is in there

731
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,480
like it's it's complex yeah and then the

732
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:27,678
effect just clean I think my favorite is

733
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,360
the mix light um the addition of some

734
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,480
light you know like sunlight and and

735
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,359
artificial light right there's been a

736
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,200
handful of strains that I've grown

737
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:39,079
indoors outdoors and then you put it

738
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:43,200
into a mix light and the expression it

739
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:45,240
gets is is is just it's night and day I

740
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,759
think it's the future too I honestly

741
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,359
think mix light is the future of of

742
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,640
cannabis in the world you know as far as

743
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,839
if you're talking about the best bang

744
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,679
for your buck if you want for quality

745
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,599
not that outdoor is you know outdoor's

746
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,278
amazing too but as far as if you want an

747
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,558
indoor product I think eventually we're

748
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,919
going to go away from these big

749
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,359
facilities and really focus on mix light

750
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,919
yeah I think it has to you know

751
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,639
especially in California like the cost

752
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,799
of produce is is just astronomical the

753
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,799
power prices that we pay here it's just

754
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:18,119
it's too much there there's some Growers

755
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:20,720
as you know preferred Gardens and Lucas

756
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:23,439
from Emerald kid like T Mansion like

757
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,880
they're light supplemental is you know

758
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,759
we'll go up against anyone's indoor yeah

759
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,679
and I think the only thing you you get

760
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,319
from the Outdoors is like the shelf life

761
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,038
is a little shorter what do you think

762
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,158
that's contributed from I don't know the

763
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,919
oxidation just breaks down quicker like

764
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,200
I don't I I've never really you know was

765
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,600
actually having this conversation with

766
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,840
David the other day like I've never been

767
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:46,038
able to put my finger on it he hasn't

768
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,398
either just like yeah I don't know the

769
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:50,558
sun just breaks it down quicker or once

770
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,879
it gets in a bag you have a a shorter

771
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,038
shelf life huh interesting it'd be

772
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,200
interesting to figure out where that

773
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:58,119
comes from but yeah I'm a big fan of the

774
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,399
mixed light and the just greenhouse and

775
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,439
General and I think it's better for the

776
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:03,119
planet I think it's as good if not

777
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,880
better of product you have the sun in

778
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,479
there Sunkissed sun-kissed get the sun

779
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,840
kissed yeah and then even in the winter

780
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,839
you can do make slide yeah so yeah the

781
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:18,398
little cooler temps some under canopy

782
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:20,038
you it's like well shout out to fav

783
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,239
these guys craft farmer fav these guys

784
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,519
doing under canopies but yeah I like the

785
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,038
favin I've seen really good results

786
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,519
we're running them here yeah it's cool

787
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:30,000
to see the new you know like I said I

788
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,399
have I have a background in Tech so to

789
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,200
see the new innovations that are

790
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:34,479
happening you know like and I think

791
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,798
that's one of the good things you know

792
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,880
even with this rescheduling right like

793
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:42,440
it's it's schedule one the government's

794
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,559
saying there's no medical benefit right

795
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,360
we're getting schedule three if it goes

796
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,240
out you know goes that way like they're

797
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:51,479
saying okay well there is some benefit

798
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,000
right it's the small steps but again now

799
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,798
it's going to open up more money to

800
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,640
really start doing R&amp;D R&amp;D is expensive

801
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,359
you know like and that's where the

802
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,360
evolution needs to go and it needs to

803
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:07,038
get pushed a little faster hope the 280e

804
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:09,079
disappears and and Bank you know real

805
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,240
real Banking and lending starts coming

806
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:13,798
out of this and it's just going to push

807
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,038
the The Innovation you know quicker

808
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,319
right and we have countries like Israel

809
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:20,640
that are just so far ahead of us with 40

810
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,359
years ahead of us testing and studies

811
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,399
but we have the opportunity to change at

812
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:27,000
any moment and so you know I think that

813
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:28,599
part of it definitely is a good thing

814
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,079
the government's known as been okay for

815
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,558
all this time and now they're finally

816
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,798
like okay well I mean they've held the

817
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:37,798
patent on you know cannabis as a as a a

818
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,119
medicine right like since the 70s right

819
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:43,278
and at the same time in schedule one so

820
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:46,038
you know like once I realize that it's

821
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,880
just you know it's just it was always a

822
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:52,200
money grab and and you know them just

823
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,640
trying to control with lobbyists and you

824
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,278
know you look at the history and it's

825
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,519
just it's sad I mean strange world we

826
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:01,720
live in yeah yeah it is unfortunately

827
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,798
but hopefully some of the you know the

828
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,839
old ways are are starting to to die off

829
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,759
and even my grandparents when I told

830
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,879
them you know what I was getting into

831
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,599
you know like it was it took a second

832
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,519
for them to like that's good it helps

833
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,638
helps people but it it's also it's very

834
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,679
addictive and I'm like you know like

835
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:21,638
reer Madness like probably is one of the

836
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,960
best marketing campaigns of all time

837
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:25,038
like we're still trying to break those

838
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,679
chains you know like for sure we

839
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,599
recently moved from trucky down to Grass

840
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,600
Valley and like learning new new friends

841
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,079
I mean we have a farm on our property

842
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,439
and it's just like you know having new

843
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,119
friends and having to like disclose that

844
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,600
to you know kids parents and stuff like

845
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,479
that you know most of people have been

846
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,879
open but it's still like you know people

847
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,679
still look at you a little different you

848
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,080
know and it's sure 50 60 years of this

849
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,720
bad information just beat into people's

850
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:54,960
heads you know I remember in high school

851
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,159
we used to we used to get high and watch

852
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
watch reer like but people really

853
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,559
thought that's what it did don't was it

854
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,200
on acid have a bad trip that's a great

855
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,519
way to do it watch it over and over

856
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,480
that's M comedy man yeah it's it's funny

857
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,079
how impactful that was yeah and how many

858
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,679
people still I mean there's a lot of

859
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,519
people you over 50% of America is fine

860
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,519
with it I believe I think like the the

861
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:25,000
last poll is like pushing 7 like 65 68%

862
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,679
I said the cats out of the bag and and

863
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,240
you know actually it took my grandmother

864
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,880
she had room and tour arthritis and I I

865
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,319
would send her CBD cream yeah and she

866
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,679
was like wow this is actually starting

867
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,720
to work you know so I think the CBD the

868
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,679
whole Farm Bill like really helped

869
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,759
people realize it's not the devil's

870
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,880
lettuce it's not going to right you know

871
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:45,558
people aren't going to run a muck

872
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,320
jumping out of buildings you know like

873
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:51,038
it it it you know it helped and you know

874
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,960
push I think where where we're going you

875
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,440
know a lot quicker yeah well it's funny

876
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,880
because like stuff like you hear

877
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,798
thca and you think oh that [Â __Â ] gets you

878
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,600
high and yes it does but also if you

879
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,519
don't heat it up it does not yeah I

880
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:09,199
remember the first time I ate a gram of

881
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,960
thca I have uler of colitis and so my

882
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,759
good friend Tim over at can Organics

883
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,319
made a bunch of thca for me and I had

884
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,960
tried eating it for you I was I was a

885
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:23,158
little nervous eating a gram of it

886
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,159
because I know eating gram of THC like

887
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,720
1,000 milligrams would give me good yeah

888
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,039
oh yeah but yeah did it doesn't get you

889
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,079
high at all but it it did have a good

890
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,359
effect on my gut health so

891
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,240
anti-inflammatory properties and you

892
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,879
know these are the things that we're

893
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,440
going to be researching yeah and you

894
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,039
know exponentially faster than we could

895
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,159
before yeah so I'm I'm excited about

896
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:48,079
that part Absol schedule three now how

897
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,320
they tax it and how they do other things

898
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,158
people are like they're not going to tax

899
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,278
it no they're Uncle Sam taxes everything

900
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,480
they're GNA tax the [Â __Â ] out of it

901
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:56,240
unfortunately you want to know who your

902
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,440
silent partner is is Uncle Sam you know

903
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,679
yeah it's just how it goes but you know

904
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,240
I mean we have to move forward I think

905
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:06,038
the biggest win here is is that you know

906
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,639
they're now finally saying that not the

907
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:10,838
devil it's not you know there is some

908
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,240
benefit to it and you know I think a lot

909
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:16,239
of us got into this understanding the

910
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:18,959
benefits and wanting to you know I think

911
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,878
one of the problems with 64 is that like

912
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,039
we used to donate to this group of

913
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:28,279
children um in Nevada county in the 215

914
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:31,000
uh a lar were trim and a lot of those

915
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,159
avenues like disappeared with 64

916
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,199
unfortunately yeah and we were making

917
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,398
some great strides and working with kids

918
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:42,960
with epilepsy and all sorts of you know

919
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:45,358
uh issues and I'm happy to see that kind

920
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,159
of come back now real doctors and real

921
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,199
people like getting involved and trying

922
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:53,119
to isolate some yeah I mean during the

923
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:56,158
215 days it was like some of the doctors

924
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,039
were little you know little there were

925
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,039
Dr Frank laso one of the greatest

926
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,679
doctors I've ever known you know and he

927
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,358
was like really about it and there was

928
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:07,000
doctors that were about the money grab

929
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:11,119
you know little the 99 plant it's 125

930
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,920
for this script or it's 300 for this or

931
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,680
500 I remember at one point they so some

932
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,480
of the doctors were charging 500 for a

933
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,879
99 script yeah Frank luo was great he's

934
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,800
he just retired last year but he was

935
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,358
writing scripts so he was one of the

936
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,160
first ones so he also wrote my buddy's

937
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:32,319
younger brother when he was 14 script

938
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:34,239
yeah he had medical issues and but he

939
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,320
was a Believer and believer in the plant

940
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,000
and all the benefits that that the plan

941
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,400
could give us and I would love to get

942
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,039

943
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,838
yeah yeah I mean i' I've heard you say

944
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:46,159
it for a long time and it always stuck

945
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,920
with me was you know the sacred plant

946
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,759
and like I said R&amp;D is expensive but

947
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,639
like you know hopefully we can keep

948
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,760
pushing it and and and seeing what we

949
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:58,000
can do I mean we lost 50 60 years to not

950
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,319
really being able to see see what this

951
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,679
plan can do so I'm excited you know for

952
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:04,358
for the next yeah iteration of the

953
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,960
industry yeah I mean I'm just happy to

954
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:07,838
be alive you know we takeing this thing

955
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,800
one day at a time and seeing where the

956
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,599
future I try to live in the present as

957
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,640
much as possible and not get too excited

958
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:18,359
about the future or too upset about the

959
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:20,279
past and we're we're in an amazing time

960
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,159
on on some levels we're in the strangest

961
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,680
freaking weird place ever yeah I never

962
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,559
thought there'd be a time where I didn't

963
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,159
understand the younger generation yeah

964
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,440
because I feel like that's that's always

965
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,480
like the case and it's like I just don't

966
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,720
get some of the kids these days and and

967
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,119
you know I feel like how my parents and

968
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,358
my grandparents thought about the work

969
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,720
ethic of my generation is kind of how I

970
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:42,960
feel about the work ethic of the younger

971
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,399
generation it's like I feel like our

972
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,240
generation has like this work ethic and

973
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,599
you know not all of us there's a lot ofy

974
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,159
friends that I grew up with but a lot of

975
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,599
people do have work ethic and then the

976
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,559
younger generation I think with

977
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:58,079
technology it's made life easier made

978
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,318
people softer but like

979
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,680
my father's generation and my

980
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,480
grandfather's generation those guys were

981
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,399
way tougher than our generation I feel

982
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,960
like absolutely these guys were made of

983
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,079
leather yeah yeah no I I you know my

984
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,800
parents were both like first generation

985
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,318
my dad's side came from from Norway my

986
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,560
my my mom's side from off the boat from

987
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,679
Italy yeah you know and and some of the

988
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,719
things that I grew up watching your

989
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:26,559
stories I heard and and like you know

990
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:28,919
visibility like saw like my my my dad

991
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,440
and my my uncle had to like literally

992
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,920
dig out underneath the house to make a a

993
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,559
basement have like a you know like a den

994
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,039
for everybody you know like at like 10

995
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,679
12 years old you know just digging

996
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,920
things like that and I grew up in a

997
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:45,000
construction family and and I get

998
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,159
dropped off after kindergarten I get

999
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,280
dropped off to my dad's job site and

1000
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:51,279
have to run around pick up pieces of

1001
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,240
wood and clean up you know at the end of

1002
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,040
the day and now like we kind of live on

1003
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,519
a farm so like my kids are all of a

1004
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,519
sudden have a huge CH chor less to do

1005
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,280
you know they're not happy about it like

1006
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,000
they weren't you know they weren't

1007
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,000
around that but now it's like you know

1008
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,400
we we live on a big you know piece of

1009
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,400
property and everyone has their

1010
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,599
responsib everyone has their

1011
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,800
responsibilities Mexico that's another

1012
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,599
interesting place with cannabis now yeah

1013
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,000
I mean I think Mexico uh Colombia

1014
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,960
especially being you know around the

1015
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,838
equator yeah you know kind of like what

1016
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,358
they did to you know like the The Cut

1017
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,400
Flower industry and stuff like I've done

1018
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,519
a lot of work and over the years and

1019
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,760
montere and you know like watching that

1020
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,000
you know get moved to to South America

1021
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,240
like it's you know wonder how that's

1022
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,440
going to affect you know cannabis going

1023
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,199
you know I think the breeding's great

1024
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,119
you know like being in a 1212 and not

1025
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:43,679
having to to manipulate the lights at

1026
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,358
all like I think it could be a great

1027
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,399
area to breed but well you're breeding

1028
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,279
for different things down there like

1029
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,358
high humidity you know and and things

1030
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,160
that do well in that 1212 environment

1031
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:53,480
you could take something that performs

1032
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,838
really well here and bring it down there

1033
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,159
and it might not perform and something

1034
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,400
that sucks up here and bring it down

1035
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,639
there and it might perform really well

1036
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,838
also you could take something here that

1037
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,598
you think is going to be a certain way

1038
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,119
you bring it down there it's completely

1039
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,000
different so that's the beautiful thing

1040
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,838
about you know climate and localized

1041
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,318
genetics that work well for those local

1042
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,199
environments I mean we talk about land

1043
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,480
race yeah bringing the race back to land

1044
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,399
I guess again going back to Innovation

1045
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,519
you know being you know through

1046
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,639
regulations getting spurred right like

1047
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:25,358
we're breeding for you know not just the

1048
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:27,000
effects of the tpping but also breeding

1049
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,799
for like traits we're looking for you

1050
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,280
know like there's you know some that are

1051
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,920
you know Bettis resistant or pest

1052
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,000
resistant like you know again that's

1053
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,800
where I feel like we're going to make

1054
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,079
some Leaps and Bounds over the next

1055
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,160
couple years if you know if the

1056
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,400
rescheduling happens and well and I

1057
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:46,759
think there's a lot of traits that

1058
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,838
people don't even think about right you

1059
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,160
know when they're doing breed a lot of

1060
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:50,880
breeders aren't even thinking about like

1061
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:52,960
does this plant trigger faster than this

1062
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,680
plant yeah because those sort of traits

1063
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,960
can be extremely beneficial in places

1064
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,759
that have shorter Seasons right

1065
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,480
you know and not everything triggers at

1066
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,280
the same point yeah you know and it's

1067
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,519
and but there's so many traits like that

1068
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,960
yeah no I I GRE one this past year that

1069
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:14,000
outside like it won't trigger until it

1070
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,240
gets right at 12 12 you know and had it

1071
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,639
still still up in in November you know

1072
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,159
like getting to Thanksgiving and but you

1073
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,519
put it in a depth and manipulate the

1074
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:25,960
light triggers triggers and it finishes

1075
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:29,280
quicker right you know so it's fun like

1076
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,440
I love I love I love breeding I love you

1077
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,519
know the fale hunting side of things I

1078
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,760
think you know like that's often

1079
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,599
overlooked right everyone wants to be a

1080
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,680
breeder Mash they want to be a breeder

1081
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,680
but they all want just want to make

1082
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,639
seeds they don't not all of them some

1083
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,960
people love it yeah but a lot of people

1084
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,759
think the breeding is making the seeds

1085
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,000
and that's like the the smallest part of

1086
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,160
the whole breeding process is this it's

1087
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the part that anybody can do it's the

1088
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,960
seed selection and going through and

1089
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,039
sometimes just hitting the lottery with

1090
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,358
stuff and other times knowing you're

1091
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,880
life really well and knowing that you

1092
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:02,119
need to pop 20 seeds and you're going to

1093
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,039
find kind of what you're looking for you

1094
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,720
know we people argue about big hunts and

1095
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,239
little hunts and it's it's different for

1096
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,039
everybody in what you're looking for if

1097
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,199
you're trying to find unicorns you know

1098
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,000
and you're going through big hunts

1099
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,799
that's cool and if you're trying to find

1100
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
specific things in smaller hunts that's

1101
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,680
good too how much of your resources you

1102
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,920
want to dedicate to one specific Cross

1103
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:26,838
or to tons of different crosses I think

1104
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,960
like now now the the whole concept of

1105
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:30,480
cure

1106
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,240
you know is is being thrown around a lot

1107
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,280
but I think on the feno hunt side like

1108
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,879
knowing what you're looking for is you

1109
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,040
know and being able to pull pull that

1110
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,838
right thing out like for sure it's a

1111
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:45,199
whole new uh trait or you know like that

1112
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:47,440
I think is overlooked a lot and it's a

1113
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,199
whole there's a whole art to it too and

1114
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,920
also knowing your lines because the more

1115
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,318
you work with those lines the more you

1116
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,400
know them and you know kind of what it's

1117
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:58,679
going to pass on like depending on what

1118
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,400
the parents are and you can easily

1119
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,598
identify stuff if you work with it a lot

1120
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,119
but if you're working with completely

1121
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,800
new stuff all the time it's harder to

1122
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:07,720
get a grasp of really what's

1123
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,480
contributing what and and I think that's

1124
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:11,279
unfortunately where the industry is

1125
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,159
right it's like everyone wants a new

1126
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,079
hottest thing you know like but you know

1127
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,920
the people that I grew up around you

1128
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,920
know breeding and and stuff like they

1129
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,079
worked lines for years and years and

1130
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,318
years you know to to to get something

1131
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,359
and I think that's one of those Arts

1132
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,759
that have kind of been lost right now a

1133
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:29,480
lot of my stuff that worked a lot I

1134
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,599
don't even offer because people don't

1135
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,318
appreciate it so stuff that we've been

1136
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,880
working for the last four years since

1137
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:40,480
2018 especially like I don't share a lot

1138
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,838
of I the autoflowers yes but the photo

1139
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,318
period stuff not so much because people

1140
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:47,759
just don't appreciate it they want rs1

1141
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:49,279
times permanent marker you know or or

1142
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,319
whatever it is the latest greatest cross

1143
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,800
with the latest greatest whatever your

1144
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,358
latest greatest cross with everybody

1145
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,440
else's latest greatest that's kind of

1146
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:58,598
what people are super hyperfocused on

1147
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,960
but I think we are going back my banana

1148
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,200
cough has been selling like crazy which

1149
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,119
is the Fort Collins cough times banana Z

1150
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,078
that I made yeah and I wouldn't say that

1151
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,358
it has a great bud structure I wouldn't

1152
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,200
say that it finishes early it's it's but

1153
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:15,318
it's special because that Fort Collins

1154
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:17,719
cof is like the nl5 haze like the piff

1155
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:21,480
Cuban black Haze you know there's so

1156
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:23,239
many nl5 Haze crosses that are good and

1157
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,599
Fort colins cough is special and it

1158
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:27,598
Spears out and it grows tall and you

1159
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,318
know short it doesn't it doesn't Bush

1160
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,960
out it all it just kind of shoots up

1161
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:32,838
okay you get a little lot of not a

1162
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,720
little but a lot of apical growth where

1163
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:37,960
it's just like one main shoot and then

1164
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:41,239
side branches that are all smaller but

1165
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,920
it has this crazy funky like nose

1166
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:46,879
burning profile it's not like your

1167
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,159
typical sativa which is what I like

1168
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,480
which is kind of like piff is like that

1169
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,159
too it's not a typical sativa and so you

1170
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,400
put some candy on there and you're going

1171
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,639
to get some real funky stuff I like

1172
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,559
sometimes taking both ends the Spectrum

1173
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,879
and putting them together see what you

1174
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:02,839
get like I almost think that's better

1175
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,480
you know it's like one thing just

1176
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:06,679
putting all the gelato with another

1177
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,719
gelato and that's it's fine yeah but

1178
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:10,879
going real extreme on stuff where it's

1179
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,439
like I'm gonna take the shortest plant

1180
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,119
that grows the slowest and then put it

1181
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,679
with the most vigorous crazy plant that

1182
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,480
gets super tall that I need shorter yeah

1183
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,239
and seeing what comes off of that we're

1184
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,039
doing some wild fenal hunting right now

1185
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,358
and we have some stuff that's completely

1186
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,400
like the opposite I have stuff that's 6

1187
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:30,519
weeks old that like still only this but

1188
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,639
it's like Bush and then we have some

1189
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:36,400
stuff that's like five feet tall the

1190
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,159
feminized portion is is you need to like

1191
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,680
understanding the lines and then all of

1192
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,159
a sudden it's like an onion sometimes

1193
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,759
like all a sudden you open you take

1194
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:44,358
another layer off and you're like I

1195
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,599
didn't know that was in there you know

1196
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:47,159
like all a sudden something you know

1197
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,680
right field you're like where the hell

1198
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:51,078
did that come from what's like the

1199
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:52,759
Skittles s once like you get a lot of

1200
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,960
stuff that's most of it's not Skittles

1201
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:59,880
not Skitty not stuff that I and and

1202
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,318
there's also tpine like lyine and tpine

1203
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,680
in the freaking progeny too when you

1204
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:07,960
cross Skittles to itself yeah first

1205
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:10,000
class Genex my buddy Ray he had some

1206
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,119
problems with his Skittles and it was

1207
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,039
definitely tpine dominant really after

1208
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:18,838
yeah epigenetics okay which we can still

1209
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,318
argue whether epigenetics exist or not

1210
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:25,000
but I definitely think I so my my first

1211
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,920
experience with that was the ghost

1212
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,119
OG and Josh Doo

1213
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,920
where they'd gone through two different

1214
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,640
places and growing side by side they're

1215
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,599
similar but they're totally different

1216
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,318
and so those have taken two different

1217
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,838
paths even though at one point they were

1218
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,639
a clone off of the same plant uhuh and

1219
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:43,558
they're different do you think that's

1220
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:46,318
like from style or for like I don't want

1221
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:48,440
to say genetic drift because it's

1222
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,519
whatever epigenetics it's those those

1223
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,159
plants experience bacterial load and who

1224
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,519
knows pathogens over the period of time

1225
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,960
and maybe they fight off some and maybe

1226
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:59,960
there's good bacteria that changes in

1227
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,880
the plant yeah you know so there's these

1228
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,079
chemical changes that occur maybe it's

1229
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,599
not just genetics but they can be

1230
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,559
different expressions and be very

1231
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,519
similar and you know I grew them side by

1232
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,119
side and saw that so but yeah that's

1233
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:15,119
been the argument lately like is

1234
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:17,119
epigenetics real is you know for sure

1235
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,760
all this stuff is real but to what

1236
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,318
extent and then what is tissue culture

1237
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,720
did say that yeah right yeah I know that

1238
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:24,279
that's kind of a Hot Topic right now I

1239
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,480
was just listening to another podcast or

1240
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,880
like oh no the hormones change the

1241
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,199
change the structure of the plant and

1242
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,119
stuff like that and you know definitely

1243
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:34,000
have done like fingerprinting the DNA

1244
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:35,559
and looking at it before and after and

1245
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,318
you know there there's no change that's

1246
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,800
happening right at the DNA level but I

1247
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,318
think if you look at Styles good

1248
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,039
bacteria bad bacteria pests all that

1249
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:46,679
stuff plays into it right like even

1250
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,679
microclimates too like that's not really

1251
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,318
about a lot too you know like in Grass

1252
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:52,598
Valley like I think it's one of the best

1253
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:55,119
microclimates in California and what I

1254
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:58,680
can do there you know what I can pull

1255
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:01,119
out of you know Str and you know we grew

1256
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:03,480
in in the Central Valley for five or six

1257
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,559
years so it's like totally different you

1258
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,679
know but I think this is all becoming

1259
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:10,559
like fashion it's becoming cyclical and

1260
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:13,000
seeing some of the old stuff come back

1261
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,760
honestly like tissue culture we knew we

1262
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,838
had to to do it you know at one point

1263
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,559
like you know me when me and Jay got

1264
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:22,159
together like it was really we were

1265
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,400
trying to do it for for inhouse like for

1266
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,399
for what we were developing trying to

1267
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,039
clean up the genetics like at that point

1268
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,680
like you know coming from the 2115 into

1269
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,159
the 64 error yeah I remember Crockett

1270
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,558
growing in in montere and that's when

1271
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,799
the first time we started learning about

1272
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,640
pesticide drift right like and then what

1273
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,119
what's in those plans too like you know

1274
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:43,598
we all shared genetics back then you

1275
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,640
didn't know what someone's IPM protocols

1276
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,838
were you know like they were spraying

1277
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:50,159
some bad stuff you get it and you know

1278
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,358
micro buttin all and forbid like that

1279
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,159
stuff was in there for Generations yeah

1280
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:58,239
you know and we really went down the

1281
00:47:55,159 --> 00:48:00,639
route of tissue culture to remove that

1282
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:03,039
and we were trying to develop our our

1283
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:05,799
our property in in Yolo County was

1284
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,199
hitting like a bunch of speed bumps and

1285
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,480
all a sudden there's like thousands of

1286
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,239
plants you know starting to back up and

1287
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,159
you know we became a nursery by by

1288
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,239
accident you know like Jay I just

1289
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:19,159
remember like standing in there with Jay

1290
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,519
and and Bo and the nursery and were

1291
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:21,960
looking at all these plants like we have

1292
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:23,759
nowhere to put them you know I was like

1293
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,519
I guess we start selling them you know

1294
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,880
and and even like tissue culture I

1295
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:30,318
remember you know know at the emerald

1296
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,960
cup we were sitting there we didn't have

1297
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:34,199
enough plants to sell at this point

1298
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,679
we're trying to tell everyone what we

1299
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:39,679
were doing this would have been like 16

1300
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:42,358
17 I think and people at the emerald

1301
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,078
crop are like I'd say like 25% got it

1302
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:46,639
and like we we were like showcasing we

1303
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,039
had like 10 plans to Showcase you know

1304
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:51,159
and people were looking at us like you

1305
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,119
know multiple people oh this is GMO you

1306
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,879
know like you and Ron Santo were like

1307
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,880
this is a practice that's been used for

1308
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,160
40 years in in in trying to explain it

1309
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,640
why it's so important emal C though oh

1310
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:07,118
yeah I mean the old days no no no I I

1311
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:09,318
mean I have so many people so many

1312
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,280
people like in the old days like all you

1313
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:13,159
need to do is put that that genetic back

1314
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,599
outside for a full moon cycle it'll be

1315
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:17,798
totally the same again It'll like reset

1316
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,760
everything yeah well you know and so

1317
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:22,480
it's funny because DJ Short he told me

1318
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,760
this is a long long time ago when I was

1319
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,280
super excited about tissue culture like

1320
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,960
I was like this is the bill grah when

1321
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,480
Bill grah was the tissue culture guy

1322
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,519
back in you know 2009 or 2010 or

1323
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,400
something like that I was super excited

1324
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:36,318
and I was sitting next to DJ Short and I

1325
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,160
was told him I want to learn tissue

1326
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,960
culture and he's like actually all you

1327
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:44,598
need to do is put that plant in the

1328
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,000
ground and you do that in the spring and

1329
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:47,240
you're going to take Fresh Cuts every

1330
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,960
year off that and you'll get the same

1331
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:51,639
results as tissue culture well depending

1332
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,240
on Whose tissue culture you know because

1333
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:54,879
I'm sure you might get better results

1334
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,039
than certain people that are doing

1335
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,400
tissue culture that don't know what

1336
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:58,798
they're doing and right there's

1337
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,798
different types of tissue culture people

1338
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:02,480
don't understand that either they think

1339
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:05,159
all tissue culture is the same and it's

1340
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,960
not mirr stem tissue

1341
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,358
culture uh when you're using

1342
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,119
undifferentiated

1343
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:12,598
cells uh it's a lot harder to do a lot

1344
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,000
more time consuming a lot more time

1345
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:19,079
consuming uh and then just being able to

1346
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,679
do nodle properly yep you know and I

1347
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,000
think there's a lot of these kits and

1348
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:24,919
the kits are great ways for people to

1349
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,199
learn and develop an understanding for

1350
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,599
tissue culture yeah but I don't think

1351
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,399
they are the future of tissue culture

1352
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:34,280
most people are going to have Labs like

1353
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,639
you have a lab I have a lab we have Labs

1354
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,440
we have technicians to know what they're

1355
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:39,480
doing and you can learn some of it on

1356
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,280
your own but to take it to the level

1357
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,280
that you guys are at is very very

1358
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,960
difficult for most people yeah I think

1359
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,119
you know understanding that at scale is

1360
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,119
there's very few people that can do it

1361
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,079
in the world you guys are at a scale

1362
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,880
that no one else is at yeah I mean no

1363
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:56,480
one no one else is even touching it it's

1364
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,480
pretty pretty amazing it's cool it's

1365
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,960
cool cool to see like I said it's world

1366
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,318
class group of people yeah you know

1367
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,358
there is pathologist from UC Davis you

1368
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:07,920
know she actually wrote most of the the

1369
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,318
primers for for pcrs and stuff like that

1370
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,440
you know to see some of the people that

1371
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,880
you know again I'm I'm a geek at heart

1372
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,079
you know like I I wrote software

1373
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,720
developed software developed you know

1374
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,880
Hardware too for for 15 years as I was

1375
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,358
like also in cannabis you know growing

1376
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,838
in my garage so right I'm a geek at

1377
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:29,039
heart so for me like bringing you know a

1378
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:32,159
form of tech biotech in cannabis is is

1379
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:34,639
my dream space yeah and we started it at

1380
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,078
finest like when me and Jay and this is

1381
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:39,920
like just the next iteration you know

1382
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,599
and conception is also now like getting

1383
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,639
ready to open up a lab in Portugal and

1384
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:47,519
you know we've spent to time in Spain

1385
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,199
the last couple years together and and

1386
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,519
you know trying to get into the Germany

1387
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,879
market like it's best iners ever yeah

1388
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:56,199
it's it's just it's it's cool to see

1389
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,079
like you know like I think a lot of

1390
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:58,960
people

1391
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:00,720
are looking at California and the

1392
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,480
problems we have here but like I think

1393
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,798
we're in you know we're all we're all

1394
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,719
kind of Treading Water you know but like

1395
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:10,679
there's a it I think the good time is is

1396
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,879
still coming you know it's a lot of

1397
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:15,519
people talk about the the good old times

1398
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,480
but I think moving forward from you know

1399
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:20,599
genetics and and just the science side

1400
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,760
of things like I think we're we're

1401
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,798
really starting to you know starting to

1402
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,839
push hard so with tissue culture I I

1403
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:29,199
wanted to do this subject justce this in

1404
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:33,599
my book and so we had Matt steer from

1405
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:35,598
apical biotech he wrote the chapter and

1406
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,880
I didn't really touch the chapter it was

1407
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,160
but but I feel like it's such an

1408
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,240
important thing to have an understanding

1409
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,558
of moving forward in the future because

1410
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:44,199
if you want clean genetics either you're

1411
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,680
going to be growing from seed or you're

1412
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,159
going to be going from tissue culture

1413
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,960
plants it's not a lot of Clone

1414
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,039
propagation unless it was from tissue

1415
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,480
culture because there's so many problems

1416
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:55,400
with everything not just hopon and I

1417
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,880
think a lot of people focus on hopon

1418
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,400
viroid but it's like that's just one of

1419
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,280
yeah one of 20 issues that more more

1420
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,639
than that one of 50 issues it could

1421
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,440
probably have and I think we're still

1422
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:10,318
learning about them too right you know

1423
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:13,358
like you know the whole nodal uh marem

1424
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:16,159
right now like we test right for 40

1425
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:18,679
pathogens right and okay it's clean you

1426
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,480
can use Nole or do you use marem you

1427
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:24,399
know like back and forth we do both you

1428
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:27,039
you know like and I think marem is also

1429
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,000
a kind of like an insurance policy like

1430
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,798
what if we find something new that has

1431
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,838
been sitting in that tissue you know

1432
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:34,679
like we're propagating right it's

1433
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:38,000
interesting and and then I don't know if

1434
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:40,519
you read the article Kevin M mcnamer

1435
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,559
from medicinal genomics just started

1436
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:45,358
talking a lot about hbd being you know

1437
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,760
transmitted now through pollen like we

1438
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,759
thought it was you know just through

1439
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,240
dirty I haven't read that yet it's

1440
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,720
pretty definitely need to read that

1441
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:55,598
because I was always curious whether you

1442
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,279
can transmit hoping through pollen I

1443
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,318
think we talked about that first time on

1444
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,599
the podcast right like totally at that

1445
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:03,880
point like people thought 10 15% you

1446
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,119
know like and don't quote me on the

1447
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,318
exact number but I think it was 50 60%

1448
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,318
like he's saying like 50 60%

1449
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:11,558
transmission rate yeah that's why

1450
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:13,558
because yeah what you're saying purple

1451
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:15,920
City genetics did a study and they found

1452
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,480
10% transmission or 10 seven I believe

1453
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,639
it was seven to 10 but Kevin mckernin

1454
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,000
whatever he says I I would go with a lot

1455
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:23,639
of the stuff that he says he's super

1456
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,960
smart they're doing some amazing stuff

1457
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:27,679
over there and you know also resistant

1458
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,199
strengths find stuff that's resistant to

1459
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:33,159
H PL and verid well and we've been we

1460
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,798
you know everything that we bring into

1461
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:37,879
culture at um a conception actually gets

1462
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:39,280
tested with medicinal genomics yeah so

1463
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,519
we're doing the mapping of the The

1464
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,599
genome but you know we're also trying to

1465
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:47,079
work super full genome yeah on

1466
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:49,760
everything yeah you know like the whole

1467
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:52,599
the whole mind proposition is you know

1468
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,559
like a Nursey like can this is this

1469
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:56,119
right and who's whose word are you

1470
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,240
taking you taking my word like where did

1471
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:59,599
I get it like did I get the right one

1472
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,199
did they get the wrong you know yeah

1473
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,760
we're using my florid DNA same idea but

1474
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:05,558
it's like the fingerprinting technology

1475
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,520
is there you might not be able to tell

1476
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,880
if it was a sister or if it was 100% if

1477
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:11,719
it was related but at least you could

1478
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,440
tell if it's the exact same thing yeah

1479
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,798
and it just keeps us keeps us all honest

1480
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,280
because there's so much cut fishing

1481
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,639
going on the cut fishing game is just

1482
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,440
it's so bad and it's like it's been

1483
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,239
going on forever because somebody gets

1484
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,440
something they're like well they they

1485
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,318
want to protect whatever same thing with

1486
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,720
crosses down the road it's like I mean I

1487
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:32,199
understand people wanting to rename

1488
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:35,000
stuff to protect their IP because we

1489
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:37,480
can't fully protect IP but like renaming

1490
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,239
other people's stuff that's a joke yeah

1491
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,639
so taking credit for other people's work

1492
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:44,000
that's a joke yeah it's sad it's it's

1493
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:46,118
sad and it's been happening but but we

1494
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,880
can see the future of it not happening

1495
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:49,480
you guys can make sure it doesn't happen

1496
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,358
that you know at least to the best of

1497
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,599
your ability and that's all we can do

1498
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,679
yeah I mean like right now none of this

1499
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:56,440
is enforcable right because like if you

1500
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:57,318
take it to court where is it going to

1501
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,000
it's going to go it's going to go

1502
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:00,199
nowhere and any federal judge is going

1503
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,079
to look at and like get it out of my

1504
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:03,439
court you know like it's still illegal

1505
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,880
we're not allowed to be doing this we

1506
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,200
can't sue each other you know no yeah

1507
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,240
but I think you know again we're making

1508
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:12,078
baby steps and you know there are

1509
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,199
patents getting pushed in well and

1510
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,640
selling clones if you're going to sell

1511
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,598
clones you might as well fingerprint it

1512
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,159
so you know what it is in the bigger

1513
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:20,160
Library you have to put it against you

1514
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:23,318
can find out if it's original if it's

1515
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:25,318
something the same as somebody else's U

1516
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:27,279
but it takes baby steps right it's one

1517
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:29,119
at a time it's one foot in front of the

1518
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,760
the other and till you have a big

1519
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,400
library and well I think it's important

1520
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,920
for the The genome too like I think

1521
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,358
unfortunately like a lot of the data

1522
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,200
that the genomes like sequenced against

1523
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,199
data again like the data who's to say

1524
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,879
that this is the real data you know like

1525
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,038
exactly who's to say that this OG Kush

1526
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,920
is the real OG Kush you you're relying

1527
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,640
on the person that gave it to you yeah

1528
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,519
and that was the problem with phos right

1529
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,480
because there was stuff there was 70 or

1530
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:54,920
100 different things in there that were

1531
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,400
named different things other than OG

1532
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,280
Kush that were just OG Kush yeah and so

1533
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,559
then it just it becomes like where did

1534
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,680
you Source it the only way to really do

1535
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,119
that and in my mind is from the breeder

1536
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,440
and holding holding the breeder

1537
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,760
accountable if you know I I think that's

1538
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,679
an important thing I think that's where

1539
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,160
we're starting right like we're starting

1540
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:17,358
you know like I said everything on the

1541
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:19,798
menu goes back to the breeder you know

1542
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,358
like not just the royalty but like the

1543
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:23,960
like mapping in genome you know I'm

1544
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:26,920
saying okay this is you know stamped in

1545
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,960
history of what they created yeah we're

1546
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,798
protecting them hopefully this is also

1547
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,318
opening up a way for patents and stuff

1548
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:35,838
moving forward but it you know like when

1549
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,440
we saw what right what happened with

1550
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:39,119
corn and sword and stuff like that with

1551
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,599
Monsanto like none of this work was

1552
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,720
being done right and then all of a

1553
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:44,960
sudden Monsanto comes out and you know

1554
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,879
blankets gets patents on strains and

1555
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,880
then starts showing small farmers and

1556
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,798
forcing them to use seats hopefully this

1557
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,039
is this is that path forward like we've

1558
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,679
all put a lot of energy time money into

1559
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:58,119
creating these things and this is a way

1560
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,558
to like you know who knows where this

1561
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,039
industry is going you know like

1562
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:03,359
hopefully this is one of the ways of

1563
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,920
like cementing that you know this is

1564
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:09,078
this is mine I created this and you know

1565
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,519
stamping that that portion so and and

1566
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:13,160
again like it's just you know this

1567
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,318
regulation's going to just start you

1568
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,519
know breeding more Innovation yeah I

1569
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:20,880
mean I think that when you can start

1570
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:23,000
really capturing data and holding people

1571
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,280
to be honest accountability is so

1572
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,519
important having someone say one thing

1573
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,160
as opposed to proving one thing where

1574
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,599
you have the data and you know moving

1575
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:34,199
forward it's going to be a great thing

1576
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,000
so especially when people like Monsanto

1577
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:37,118
or whoever it is you know I mean I think

1578
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,480
there's going to be a lot of people that

1579
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,119
want to try to grab a patents and

1580
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,719
protect stuff um that's not necessarily

1581
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,280
novel but that you can't do that it's

1582
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:48,239
got to be original yeah I think again

1583
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:52,400
going back to the gnoming like the

1584
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:54,199
sequencing like I still a huge portion

1585
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,119
of this plant that we have not been able

1586
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:59,038
to really do R&amp;D on yet you know like

1587
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:02,119
the the medicinal the true the true

1588
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,880
medicinal side of it yeah and the gening

1589
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,000
you know is a step in that direction

1590
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,200
it's very difficult too A lot of people

1591
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
don't understand this this this studying

1592
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:13,960
it is very difficult yeah because you're

1593
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,639
talking about a plant that changes from

1594
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:19,798
micro variables it can change extremely

1595
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:21,879
in a period of seven days 70 days of

1596
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:24,358
flower or you know the veg plus the

1597
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:28,160
flower whatever but we're looking at a

1598
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:30,639
chemotype yeah they could be Changed by

1599
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:33,960
influence of you know environment or

1600
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:36,480
nutrition very easily right and so and

1601
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:39,559
sometimes some stress factors could

1602
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,719
cause it to change and so it's hard to

1603
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:43,798
fully study something that changes so

1604
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:45,519
much unless you can have a a chemotype

1605
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:47,318
that stays the same or like for

1606
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:49,759
manufacturing drugs yeah I mean how many

1607
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:51,440
times have you saw something on the vine

1608
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,359
cut it down put it in the bag and be

1609
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,079
like oh that's that's gone it's not

1610
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,798
there anymore you know so many times

1611
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:58,640
especially phenoh hunting it's it's like

1612
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:59,599
the winners aren't always the winners

1613
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,118
you know when you're when you're

1614
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,440
selecting on the plant as opposed to in

1615
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:07,599
the bag it's amazing what a dare two can

1616
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,838
do too like walk in and be like wow

1617
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,440
that's amazing and then tomorrow's gone

1618
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,440
you know it's just what yeah was it

1619
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,480
environmental was it you know just one

1620
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,720
portion of that you know that that that

1621
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,599
makeup showing per a second you know

1622
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,879
well then these these flavor molecules

1623
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:24,480
can be deceiving so a lot of people if

1624
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,119
you go by just a smell and you don't

1625
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,440
actually taste it sometimes the taste

1626
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:29,838
isn't there yeah or vice versa it smells

1627
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,760
like mild but then you taste it it's

1628
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,000
like wow it's overwhelming it's not

1629
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,680
always the case a lot of stuff that's

1630
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,039
loud is loud when you smoke it too but

1631
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:39,798
it's it's interesting some of the stuff

1632
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,720
that have like softer softer like smell

1633
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:44,038
on the nose and then you you hit it and

1634
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:45,639
it's like wow it's like then you get

1635
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:48,400
softer chps but sometimes they're just

1636
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:51,239
amazing yeah I think Skittles was like a

1637
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,838
perfect example of that like yeah I

1638
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:56,639
remember a friend in trucky had a a

1639
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,279
mobile dispensary up there and that was

1640
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,358
the first time I ever saw Skittles like

1641
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,039
I I was dropping off some pounds to him

1642
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:05,920
for the menu and he he was like check

1643
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:08,000
this out and pick up the bag and it's

1644
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,200
Depp you know and yeah at this time

1645
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,559
Depp's probably going for two grand

1646
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:17,159
$2,200 and he's like this is Skittles

1647
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:19,319
and I was like kind of ugly you know and

1648
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:20,399
think people usually say right when they

1649
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:23,759
and I was like what you pay for this

1650
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,760
he's like 3600 bucks I was like what

1651
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,000
he's like open it open it smell I was

1652
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:31,799
like that is different you know he's

1653
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,559
like now let's go smoke it you know and

1654
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:36,199
yeah I mean it's never judge a book by

1655
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:37,798
its cover and I think a lot of these you

1656
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:39,960
know a lot of these competitions are

1657
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:41,318
done wrong too like I wish everything's

1658
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,480
a blind taste test and like I think

1659
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,960
that's how it should be done that's how

1660
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,639
we do our fenal Huns it's like everybody

1661
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,880
gets joints down no one gets flour I

1662
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:48,440
know what the flower looks like let's

1663
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,240
just smoke it and then we can talk about

1664
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,318
the taste and the effect fortunately it

1665
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:55,118
goes back to the the marketing the

1666
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:57,440
Instagram like you know people want to

1667
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,760
want to see it like yeah I mean I'm

1668
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,880
excited about the day where they trust

1669
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,160
the brand enough to where they don't

1670
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,960
have to see the flower they can just buy

1671
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:05,960
the pre-roll and be super happy and pay

1672
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,838
premium prices on a premium flour

1673
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,358
pre-roll that they're getting Super

1674
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:12,480
Fresh but that also they need to smoke

1675
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:14,719
it fresh especially something like a

1676
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,760
joint where it's been ground up and then

1677
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:20,358
put into a piece of paper and smoked you

1678
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,720
want to smoke that sooner than later

1679
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:24,400
they don't have as long of a shelf like

1680
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:26,598
once you start [Â __Â ] with it you know

1681
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,680
I I definitely see bran

1682
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:31,440
you know recognition and brand loyalty

1683
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,480
yeah like you said like it's tough It's

1684
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,720
you know like here in California like

1685
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,798
you know consumer package product like

1686
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:41,038
it takes a month to get it to the Shelf

1687
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:43,679
you know like it's impossible like to to

1688
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:46,680
to get any quicker you know and but I

1689
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:48,558
think you know like d Toc is is is come

1690
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:51,000
in California it hasn't really taken off

1691
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,039
yet I think right but you know like

1692
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,440
hopefully you know with the the market

1693
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:57,119
maturing and stuff people are going to

1694
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,760
start like becoming loyal to Brands you

1695
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,760
know like you see it with with wine or

1696
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,640
beer you know we have a monthly

1697
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,039
membership package for seeds and I can't

1698
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:07,358
wait to the day where I can go to all

1699
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,920
these yeah all these farmers and all

1700
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,239
these guys with facilities that I'm

1701
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,400
friends with yeah and get some sort of

1702
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:15,118
monthly membership package in the mail

1703
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,480
you know where you get you get the new

1704
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,960
stuff that's coming down or maybe you

1705
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,559
get to be part of the feno hunt or

1706
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,720
whatever I think that monthly membership

1707
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,839
package is amazing the the concept of

1708
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,239
it's great but we can't do it yet in

1709
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:28,719
California yeah yeah I know County that

1710
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,278
I'm in trying to push that that farmers

1711
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:33,399
market model you know there's so many

1712
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:36,358
you know hoops and and things to jump

1713
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,599
through but I think it's coming yeah I

1714
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:40,798
mean you can go to Wineries and you can

1715
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:42,440
hear stories about the wine maker and

1716
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,400
how they made the wine and then get to

1717
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:48,440
taste the wine there I mean I would love

1718
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:51,559
to see humble and you know Trinity and

1719
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,278
mesino and Sonoma especially to be able

1720
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:55,079
to go up there and you go check out the

1721
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:56,719
farm and you can watch them Harvest if

1722
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:59,720
they're harvesting or at least hear the

1723
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:01,639
stories and try the flower and you know

1724
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:03,919
have a chill area and then you can

1725
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:06,199
experience the different Terre from one

1726
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,480
region to the next or one yeah one

1727
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:11,798
climate to the next I think that's where

1728
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,079
like the hash side too like you know

1729
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:15,318
this is like what we're talking about

1730
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:17,160
it's usually a little more btii you know

1731
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:19,159
and I think you know I remember the

1732
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:23,038
first time cutting down a greenhouse and

1733
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:25,199
freezing it I think it was probably 156

1734
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,920
you know like where there was like we're

1735
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,639
coming out of the 215 into the it wasn't

1736
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,920
we weren't regulated yet but it was just

1737
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:34,598
like prices were crashing but the hash

1738
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,680
prices were up and it felt so weird to

1739
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:39,640
freeze a whole house ended up screwing

1740
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:41,598
it up royally like you know my body was

1741
01:04:39,639 --> 01:04:44,318
like I'll just vacuum seal it throw it

1742
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:46,400
in the freezer to me vacuum silly pull

1743
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:48,960
all the hair out and crush the flow and

1744
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,519
stuff like that so but like I think you

1745
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,720
know being able to to put it into a

1746
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:56,559
shelf life a little bit longer and stuff

1747
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:58,919
like that like well rosin in extract is

1748
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,359
a a great way it's another one it's like

1749
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,039
a joint you don't actually get to see

1750
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:05,759
the flower and you're just basing on the

1751
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,359
especially on the taste and the effect

1752
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,880
right so at the end of the day rosin you

1753
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,199
you can go by what it looks like a

1754
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,960
little bit but dude that's where like

1755
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:15,598
the outdoor these guys are do an outdoor

1756
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,358
rosin like top shelf stuff that's pretty

1757
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:21,240
amazing colie a lot like yeah they do a

1758
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:24,078
lot of washing for me on the the you

1759
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:25,759
know the type six side um and I think

1760
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,359
you know that that group is one of the

1761
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,559
best in best in the business you also

1762
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:32,838
work with paper planes like we have a

1763
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,278
farm together um a lot of that stuff is

1764
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:37,199
going to live live resin I like live

1765
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:39,838
resin a lot and I was up in Washington

1766
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:42,558
and I smoked a bunch of amazing live

1767
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,038
resin up there and uh some people are

1768
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,440
just stuck on the rosin there's nothing

1769
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:49,440
wrong with rosin rosin's amazing too but

1770
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:52,400
some good live resin yeah Skittles live

1771
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,119
resin nuts it's crazy J like that's I

1772
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,119
love that stuff when it's like when it's

1773
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,278
on that level yeah I mean I think you

1774
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,720
know B hydrocarbon got a bad name

1775
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:02,880
because of the uh the refinement they

1776
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,519
were doing for a bit uh all the carbons

1777
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,599
and stuff they were you know purifying

1778
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:07,719
it with it just came all monot turp oh

1779
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,200
yeah I know exactly what you're talking

1780
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:10,519
about with they're filtering it right

1781
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,278
they're using charcoal and some other

1782
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:13,838
stuff to filter it and stuff that wasn't

1783
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:16,278
necessarily healthy and I mean it was

1784
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:18,759
like I remember being up and humble you

1785
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:21,480
know like people saying you know turn

1786
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,359
your mold into gold you know and I think

1787
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,199
it just goes back to the the product

1788
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,318
you're putting in you know whether it's

1789
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:31,199
raw resin whatever it is like if you're

1790
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:34,000
putting quality material in qu right

1791
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,679
fire out I mean this market like you

1792
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,639
have to have price points you know like

1793
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:41,078
different price price regions like rosin

1794
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,920
is a little more higher shelf right and

1795
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:44,960
not everyone can afford it you know but

1796
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,519
like live resin a lot of people can

1797
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,838
afford that you know and again going

1798
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:52,639
back to you know techniques and and

1799
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,880
things like that and and great product I

1800
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:58,000
remember 2013 when the sauce first came

1801
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:01,480
out from water dude that stuff was so

1802
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,838
nuts it you know 30% TPS on some of it

1803
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,639
which was like TP overload yeah seeing

1804
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:06,920
some of the first shatter and stuff and

1805
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,239
smoking it with some friends that was

1806
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,400
like cracking and popping and like

1807
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:13,558
totally I don't know about this stuff

1808
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,200
again you know regulations spurring

1809
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:17,079
Innovation and getting chemists and

1810
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:19,439
stuff involved now and products are

1811
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:21,160
getting better safer yeah made in the

1812
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,000
actual lab environment not just on

1813
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:27,038
someone's porch or her P stoop yeah

1814
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,358
interesting times man it's great to be

1815
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,200
part of the evolution of something this

1816
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:33,119
big that's going to be this impactful

1817
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,199
over the next however many years in the

1818
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:39,119
future that that Humanity exists this is

1819
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:40,399
impacting all of that future yeah I

1820
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,440
remember you saying like you know

1821
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,200
putting out the book and and doing this

1822
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:48,960
podcast it's like it's solidifying our

1823
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:52,159
our stamp on this history right you know

1824
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:56,039
people coming you know uh in front of us

1825
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:58,159
or you know like I think with ulation

1826
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:01,319
like a lot of people forget about what

1827
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:03,679
we went throughh you know and not just

1828
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:05,400
me but like everybody everybody we so

1829
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,078
easily forget about stuff right unless

1830
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,519
you document it yeah and I think it's

1831
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:12,039
important because like you know I've

1832
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:14,880
been raid you know like we've been

1833
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:17,000
harassed you know like in the county

1834
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,880
like I took a step forward with actually

1835
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,198
that that whole group of children that

1836
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,960
we were talking about like you know

1837
01:08:20,198 --> 01:08:26,079
supplying them tinctures and and all

1838
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,640
this stuff like our County decided that

1839
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:29,719
they wanted to ban all commercial

1840
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,798
cultivation and they banned all

1841
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:33,279
commercial cultivation they made the

1842
01:08:31,798 --> 01:08:35,798
mistake of actually putting it on the

1843
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,600
ballot yeah to to ask the county like do

1844
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:40,798
you want to regulate cannabis it funny

1845
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,759
you know I think like this industry a

1846
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:44,640
lot of times we have so much like

1847
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:46,838
headbutting you know and you have all

1848
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,119
these different layers of people got the

1849
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:51,479
hippies you got the you know all these

1850
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:53,399
all these different people like and for

1851
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:54,838
once it was cool to be a part of because

1852
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:56,479
like everyone came together because

1853
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:59,278
they're like okay okay this is US versus

1854
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:01,678
them you know we ended up getting 75% of

1855
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,920
the boote you know like in politics is

1856
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:06,480
insane strategically we had some great

1857
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,798
people helping us like Heather Burke

1858
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,919
lawyer like she always kept us out of

1859
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:13,278
jail and but you know she really was

1860
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,199
like pivotal on like structuring this

1861
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,880
and you know like it was it was a cool

1862
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:20,039
thing to be part of because we you know

1863
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:22,440
the county it's kind of funny the County

1864
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:25,960
Nevada County Grass Valley Nevada City

1865
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:29,238
is such a split County from Super crazy

1866
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:31,600
liberals to like super crazy

1867
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:33,919
conservatives yeah totally and it's like

1868
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,759
it's this huge opposite end the

1869
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,838
spectrums and you know obviously it was

1870
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:40,798
it was pretty easy to like talk to the

1871
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:43,759
Liberals and some of them might not

1872
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:45,759
wanted you know regulation coming but

1873
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,960
you know the conservatives like we we

1874
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,198
played at different you know different

1875
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,880
levels and would talk to them about this

1876
01:09:50,198 --> 01:09:53,798
also going back to land rights and stuff

1877
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,960
like that and just you know like we came

1878
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:59,679
and came together and was able to like

1879
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:02,960
you know get get it overturned and you

1880
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,239
know now regulated and and to me again I

1881
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,000
go back it's it's one of the I think

1882
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:09,759
it's one of the best microclimates in in

1883
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,439
all California like just it's it's

1884
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,480
Unique it's going up up to you know up

1885
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:16,079
to the S Nevadas it's the Foothills so

1886
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:18,119
you're getting like you know some of the

1887
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:20,960
heat coming from the the valley but then

1888
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:23,679
also these great little pockets of super

1889
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,600
dry too yeah super dry yeah I I think

1890
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:29,199
it's one of the better microclimates in

1891
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,840
in the world it's funny because between

1892
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:33,960
the mid part of California all the way

1893
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,119
through Oregon I think for outdoor

1894
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,000
cultivation that's the best in the world

1895
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:40,319
absolutely I mean it's one of the seven

1896
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,279
Mediterranean climates right like it's

1897
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,399
like unfortunately like you know I think

1898
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:46,119
when all this kind of figures itself out

1899
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,079
like we're we're Advanced to that

1900
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:50,279
portion where you can take indor and you

1901
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:51,920
can throw it in New York throw in

1902
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,479
anywhere in the world the right person

1903
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,239
running it with the right genetics like

1904
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:58,678
you're going to get a comparable product

1905
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:00,439
right you know but again it's just like

1906
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:02,560
no one has the sun we have here no one

1907
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:05,279
has the climate we have here you know

1908
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:08,880
and for either hash production or you

1909
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:10,599
know outdoor it can't really be no and

1910
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,600
I'm not saying there's not other places

1911
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,360
that it can't be grown properly and done

1912
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,280
well and I think you know there's places

1913
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:18,198
in New Mexico and places in Arizona I've

1914
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:21,198
seen some great some great hash come out

1915
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:23,919
of New York you know with and I laugh

1916
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:26,319
because like I grew up watching you know

1917
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,199
the Thunders storm STS and the hail

1918
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:31,479
storms and even portion of New York it's

1919
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:34,519
you know hurricanes in September so it's

1920
01:11:31,479 --> 01:11:36,158
just like you know the the weather and

1921
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,960
stuff that this plant gets beat up out

1922
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,599
there too but I've seen some great stuff

1923
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,719
come out of there so Jean West I don't

1924
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,880
know if you know Jee he had kickass

1925
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:47,158
Farms he's from Grass Valley he used to

1926
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:49,440
be a maror man okay amazing guy name

1927
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:53,079
sounds familiar yeah he was always doing

1928
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:54,678
really creative things that were I think

1929
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:56,960
really smart but what one of the things

1930
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:59,119
he did that shocked me was he did this

1931
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,399
technique called stock splitting that

1932
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:03,559
you could only do in Grass Valley or in

1933
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:05,359
someplace that was extremely dry because

1934
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:09,320
he would veg the plants out about you

1935
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:11,759
know yay high so and he would instead of

1936
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:15,079
supercropping or topping them to get the

1937
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,679
hormones to shoot out uh more branches

1938
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:19,559
he would take and use a buck knife split

1939
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,840
the stock down and then tape it at the

1940
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,719
bottom and then without that it would do

1941
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,560
it would have the same effect as topping

1942
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,600
right and he would have these huge

1943
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,480
plants with so many Bud sides and he'd

1944
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,920
do that so he'd split it Crossways once

1945
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,799
down and then he'd split those and so I

1946
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:36,600
mean he would run the buck yeah you know

1947
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,600
he had this video that always give me

1948
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,239
like the Shivers so I see it like dude

1949
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,360
you're killing that plant how can you do

1950
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:46,359
that and I went out and saw his plants

1951
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:48,559
and they were just amazing big huge tall

1952
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:51,880
plants that he had topped like that and

1953
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:55,679
you could only do that because of Bettis

1954
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:57,520
and other fungal pathogens I think in my

1955
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,239
opinion you could probably only do that

1956
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,639
in a handful of places in the world and

1957
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:03,638
be super successful with it but he also

1958
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,639
watered because it's so dry he was able

1959
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:09,480
to water from the top of the plant in

1960
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:10,920
the morning okay and then he would water

1961
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:13,759
from the bottom in the afternoon he cool

1962
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:15,079
the canopy and so yeah he was doing all

1963
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,520
kinds of really cool stuff I need to get

1964
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:18,600
him on the show but he's a big Grass

1965
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,199
Valley guy amazing he was an amazing

1966
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,560
grower I think he's doing other stuff

1967
01:13:20,198 --> 01:13:24,479
right now but like so many people in

1968
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,039
this industry they've gone kind of into

1969
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,119
other occupations yeah some of these

1970
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:33,079
people you know that that definitely you

1971
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:34,880
know scream you know the benefits and

1972
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:36,479
stuff like that unfortunately like some

1973
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,600
of them aren't here anymore yeah I mean

1974
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:41,879
we've lost a bunch of friends yeah you

1975
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:44,239
know Jay being one of them but so many

1976
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,800
Innovative people too and then also

1977
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:47,599
other people just quitting because it

1978
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,360
got so hard yeah and that's why I don't

1979
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,639
do cultivation that's why cultivation is

1980
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:53,479
not my jam I'd rather be into the pcks

1981
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:54,719
and shovels and on the genetics much

1982
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:57,399
much prefer because that's where my

1983
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:00,158
passion Is It Anyway is with you know I

1987
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,158
people haven't seen stuff seen these

1988
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,359
profiles before and right I'm constantly

1989

1991
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,800
it is I I I share that thought with you

1992
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,639
on on the breeding side of thing like

1993
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,800
sometimes I think I'm like a a Serial

1994
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:24,319
entrepreneur like I always want to like

1995

1996
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:29,079
serial I I think you are a Seri like my

1997
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:30,719
whole life is like my whole professional

1998
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:32,439
life has always been like you know

1999
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,399
startups in the tech industry and

2000
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:35,960
startups here and yeah you know like

2001
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:38,319
there's something about me that needs to

2002
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:41,239
trying to go forward and be ahead of it

2003
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:43,880
you know like and breeding kind of like

2004
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:45,919
clears you know satisfies that you know

2005
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,319
because I'm always getting something new

2006
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,520
you know trying to put something new out

2007
01:14:47,319 --> 01:14:52,079
there yeah and it's the Long play You're

2008
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,719
it's the long game for sure yeah

2009
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:56,800
breeding is not just the the quick money

2010
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,039
the quick this or the quick that it's it

2011
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,800
takes a lot of time to do it

2012
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:02,800
successfully to do it right I think

2013
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:05,360
that's one of the like picks and shovels

2014
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,880
that like I think now more than ever

2015
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:11,279
like genetics are are are worth more

2016
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,039
right you know like not having the right

2017
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:15,399
genetic right now some of them some of

2018
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:17,319
them of course of course but but it

2019
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:19,759
proves the point right it's like if you

2020
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:21,000
have the wrong thing even just green

2021
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,960
right now and you're playing the

2022
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,679
wholesale game it's going to be super

2023
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,800
hard to get rid of it you're you know if

2024
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:30,719
you have a purple candy runs Cross or

2025
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,520
something you know like yeah and having

2026
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,079
the right thing and understanding that

2027
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,159
the market and what the Market's asking

2028
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:39,920
for too like it's again it goes back to

2029
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:41,158
the the procurement and that's one of

2030
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,520
the things I do love about what I'm

2031
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:46,399
doing right now is being able to curate

2032
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,280
a menu of you know a percentage of them

2033
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:49,879
have to be what the industry wants but

2034
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:52,599
trying to find the best ones the newest

2035
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,719
ones the unique ones you know and then

2036
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,560
having a portion of the menu of you know

2037
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,079
people putting things in the jars and

2038
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,920
you know cultivators that don't have the

2039
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:04,000
time to breed or fenal hunt and you know

2040
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:07,158
unique strains and and unique Tarpin or

2041
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,960
canabo profiles like yeah it's cool to

2042
01:16:07,158 --> 01:16:11,479
be part of it yeah it's a great time to

2043
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,480
be alive so if people are interested in

2044
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:15,319
finding more out about you where can

2045

2046
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:20,238

with the Instagram as well too so nice

2052
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:38,520
well one last question so if you had one

2053
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,960
piece of advice for your younger self

2054
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,320
that was just starting out in the

2055
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,560
industry what would that be you know I

2056
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,719
feel like you know people use a lot of

2057
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,679
the same don't give up and you know I

2058
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,719
was actually having a conversation with

2059
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:54,079
a friend on the way here this morning

2060
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:56,480
and and you know I think it's tenacity

2061
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:59,119
you know like I was using the analogy of

2062
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:01,959
of of baseball I love baseball I grew up

2063
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:04,119
a big big Yankee fan my grandfather grew

2064
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,760
up in New York watching in the Bronx

2065
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:08,119
watching you know the Yankees play some

2066
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,079
of my first memories are are you know

2067
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:12,279
being you know going to to Yankee games

2068
01:17:11,079 --> 01:17:15,600
and stuff like that but I use the

2069
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:17,399
analogy of business right it goes back

2070
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:21,800
again to like you know being an

2071
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:24,638
entrepreneur like pivoting and baseball

2072
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:28,400
if you hit three out of 10 you're going

2073
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:29,880
to the Hall of Fame right and I think in

2074
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:31,960
this industry especially right now like

2075
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,560
we can get really down on ourselves

2076
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:36,359
because just the the state of it's in

2077
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,600
you know it's a it's a [Â __Â ] roller

2078
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:42,319
coaster for sure and from cultivation to

2079
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,840
money being you know like so all the

2080
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:46,279
games that we have to play right you

2081
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,880
know the tenacity and I'm still in it

2082
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:50,639
like a year ago like I was questioning

2083
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,880
what I was doing you know like cuz I had

2084
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:56,639
a a good you know path on on on the tech

2085
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:59,279
side but it's really just tenacity none

2086
01:17:56,639 --> 01:18:01,840
of this was there there was no recipe

2087
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:03,479
there was no book to follow like we've

2088
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,800
all made mistakes in this Tre and it was

2089
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:07,718
just like just keep going keep going

2090
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:10,199
like don't don't let certain things pull

2091
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:13,119
you down you know like honestly losing

2092
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:16,079
Jay was a big honestly I didn't have the

2093
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:18,000
time to actually process it um because

2094
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:21,439
like I was literally in the middle of of

2095
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,920
building a massive grow I literally left

2096
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:26,238
there went to his funeral for 30 hours

2097
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,760
how to come back and go right back to

2098
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:33,599
work you know and it's just you know I I

2099
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:35,560
feel like I've been on this course of

2100
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,079
this industry for a reason and it's

2101
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,199
almost like a blind faith kind of thing

2102
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,880
so like I think what I would tell myself

2103
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:46,079
is just just keep pushing you know like

2104
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:48,440
again like you said can't really can't

2105
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:50,000
really rely on what was in the past or

2106
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:51,919
what's in the future but just being in

2107
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,279
the moment i' probably actually i'

2108
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,600
probably take that from you enjoying the

2109
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:59,599
moment a little bit more you know being

2110
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:02,320
being more present not trying to worry

2111
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,880
like you know things covered or or

2112
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:06,319
worrying about the mistakes we made in

2113
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,239
the past it's like just enjoying right

2114
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:10,920

2115
