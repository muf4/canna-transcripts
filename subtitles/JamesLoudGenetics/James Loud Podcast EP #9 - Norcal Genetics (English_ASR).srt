in the Cannabis industry for how long

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,439
um I don't know like all my life really

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,539
like that's all I've ever done so Forum

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,218
days

15
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:40,140
well this is a four then but like I

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,600
would say like eight [ __ ] I must be 40

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,219
so like probably like 22 years I'd say

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,379
yeah at least something like that maybe

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,120
you've seen the evolution from I've seen

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,099
of multiple Evolutions I was like lucky

21
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,479
to like come up with a lot of the

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,039
Pioneers in the industry like I knew

23
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,479
that was a good friend of mine

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,980
um and I was just young I was like a

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,238
very like I don't know just enthusiastic

26
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:59,698
about the game there were certain people

27
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,339
that were like pivotable pivotal and

28
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,599
like within like my like it's just me

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,338
it's just weird like I just feel very

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,019
nonchalant about [ __ ] nowadays but it's

31
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,239
like I was very passionate about this a

32
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,039
lot I still am but like as far as like

33
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,140
when I was younger I was like [ __ ] on

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,939
fire I was like in it yeah and like I

35
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,978
was like hanging out with Eddie Lepp I

36
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,179
met him at like you know like shows and

37
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:19,978
stuff and then we went to Amsterdam

38
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,180
together yeah keep Ministries he's like

39
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:23,819
Soma

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,740
um Ariane um it was cool and then I just

41
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,539
got I also was like very observant as

42
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,859
far as like how the industry has played

43
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,479
out and whatnot I actually went had gone

44
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,819
out over there it was like 2000 of five

45
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,959
I believe we went for the Cannabis Cup

46
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,399
and I was just over there I was like

47
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,599
it's just using the states because we

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
have I think we were just kind of maybe

49
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,679
taking off or maybe I'm not sure but I

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,540
was like dude I'm paying 22 Euros for

51
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,860
this like a gram yeah and it's really

52
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,540
just a tourism thing because it's work

53
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,400
it was worse than like a commercial

54
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,780
flower it was commercialized stuff it

55
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,939
was probably was gonna get happen to

56
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,140
here and like I don't know however long

57
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:53,639
they were already doing it there because

58
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,959
they were just doing all sorts of stuff

59
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,700
they weren't even testing all day well

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,679
they don't have testing they have really

61
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,780
shitty growing they're not testing back

62
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,399
then I mean they have testing possible

63
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,960
now but they're also going like the

64
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,718
legal route too they're allowing like

65
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,038
legal grows

66
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,780
lots of weird stuff like back then the

67
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,280
Dutch stuff was like getting like they

68
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,780
could not even stay they had like a

69
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,239
crystalline like spray that they could

70
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,060
spray on it to make it like look like

71
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,560
more [ __ ] interesting yeah and like so

72
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,259
you were the tech I don't know if it was

73
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,939
like super shardy like

74
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,439
um glass I don't know I don't I can't

75
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,439
say I even seen it I was so foreign

76
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,139
the migration rights as far as like how

77
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,239
we were closer to um like Africa for

78
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,098
like durbins and like you know uh Hindu

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,539
like for like you know all those regions

80
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:41,459
and whatnot

81
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,019
um it was just a migration route was a

82
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,640
lot easier for them to get to like

83
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,260
towards Amsterdam area then they get all

84
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,059
the way over here right so it was more

85
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,259
typical to be able to more closer to the

86
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,939
source to be more closer to the source

87
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,939
when you're out there you know yeah so I

88
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,400
see mag do you still have your copies of

89
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,639
what I see mag the magazine oh do you

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,620

91
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,878
um I forgot I was even it was I didn't

92
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,099
get into because it was a magazine I

93
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,620
don't know

94
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:09,060
no arms right so yeah but but the

95
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,280
publication to set part of it though

96
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,500
like you know yeah so I see was

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,080
International canographic magazine and

98
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,360
yeah I still have copies yeah no that's

99
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,640
crazy yeah no I mean I was just more of

100
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,680
um you know just like I said just like

101
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,939
passionate about like showcasing what we

102
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,760
were doing at the time which was very

103
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,378
like uh minimal in a sense right you

104
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,318
know we were we had good weed back then

105
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:32,759
in the bay I think yeah I know I like of

106
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,199
course I think it was it was if you're

107
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,299
growing your own you were but we were

108
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,039
just so used to all the commercially

109
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,599
produced imported stuff most of stuff

110
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,120
was not domestically producing the laws

111
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,798
were not necessarily right like uh they

112
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,299
weren't allowing it but it wasn't like

113
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,040
now that it's LAX everyone's like I'll

114
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,780
just throw some out there like you know

115
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,000
50 pounds in a year like it's nothing

116
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,799
it's like I guess nowadays is the way

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,539
that the prices have plummeted it isn't

118
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,760
as much but back then you could like you

119
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,158
could make I remember I mean paying

120
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,939
close to like five I remember getting I

121
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,098
got I got 5 000 for for outdoor yeah for

122
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,098
outdoor totally Sour Diesel no I mean

123
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:09,298
this is just whatever regular stuff

124
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:11,339
it was it was literally I remember there

125
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,780
was times when there was it was a

126
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,580
drought like you couldn't people don't

127
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,379
there was real droughts it was like

128
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,120
there was no work that's the bottom line

129
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,918
and like so it's like yo either you have

130
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,418
to adjust to this this transitionary

131
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,359
period where like the prices are going

132
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,680
to adjust just like nowadays yeah um or

133
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,379
like no one's getting work no one's

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,660
working and then everyone kind of slowly

135
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,860
started going into it then

136
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,360
um I don't know when I was like hosting

137
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,699
and stuff I was on the like I basically

138
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,439
like first person that I knew of that

139
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,000
was doing like 40 rates and then but

140
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,160
then it was like no breaks and so I was

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,839
looking like 320 a zip you know so it

142
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
was like all right whatever like and if

143
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,619
people were hella mad at me like all the

144
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,759
like local Hustlers whatever but I was

145
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,160
taking all the business you know so

146
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,419
whatever [ __ ] yeah so let's talk a

147
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,639
little bit about Dosey though I didn't

148
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,560
know that dosey doe was your genetics I

149
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,740
always thought it was from archive for

150
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,060
the longest time

151
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,160
but you did you did some funeral hunting

152
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,540
with it like that's yeah um I mean

153
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,340
basically it was just an agreement where

154
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,780
he we were just supposed to like split

155
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,478
the seeds and so he gave me the seeds

156
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,679
yeah I did my Mark I didn't do marketing

157
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:12,120
or anything at all it was just we were

158
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,560
documenting already the form and the

159
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,800
animal

160
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,839
um on the the forums right and so like

161
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
when I got in the OG KB I was just told

162
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,959
it was cookies and I was like this plant

163
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,699
doesn't even look listen because the

164
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,439
form an animal were similar yeah the

165
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,620
form was probably a bad seat I don't

166
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,579
know this is all just speculation but

167
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,579
um so you know you can't quote

168
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,879
I think it was because the animal was

169
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,680
always more tightly held and like it was

170
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,399
known as the animal cookies from Sirius

171
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,660
no I mean well I I can't I don't know

172
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,978
what happened with that I don't all I

173
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,419
know is it's animal cookies but I don't

174
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,360
know like but serious my homie like

175
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:50,758
recipes you name but I'm just saying um

176
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,280
like you know he he you know he he was

177
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,439
definitely known for it you know but um

178
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,758
yeah as far as I know they were you know

179
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,139
when they first hit the scene everyone

180
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,919
was like tripping because it was like

181
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,259
kind of the the new coming uh from OG

182
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,240
Kush like as far as like the next thing

183
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,160
that like supposedly like the next holy

184
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,900
grail right and it actually still is

185
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,300
like you know to be honest with you like

186
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,279
but uh who's growing it these days

187
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,079
that's ironically everyone's asking for

188
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,059
it still totally people like not still

189
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,918
but yeah because everything's cyclical

190
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,600
you know it's like it's fashion it's

191
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,859
trendy you know and so now everyone

192
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,539
wants the original it's like the

193
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,860
original Girl Scout cookies was a back

194
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:26,759
seat anyways they don't even know how it

195
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,620
is that's why everyone's into this

196
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,600
Durban Poison and [ __ ] like most people

197
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,899
you ain't never smoke Durban dog well so

198
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,520
I smoke real deal yeah yeah so we smoked

199
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,899
real Durbin and it had Anis the German

200
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,399
like I have some Durban here today

201
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,219
actually we were gonna smell I haven't

202
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,959
he's at home yeah

203
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,479
um that um

204
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,120
yeah that shit's expensive yeah I mean

205
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:50,279
so this is German that I remember was

206
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,259
like straight anise and musk and it was

207
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,418
a little hazy but it wasn't like

208
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,699
this kind of haze where this is more

209
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,439
like the people the the haze flavors

210
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,939
that they know there's yeah maybe a

211
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,100
little bit of fruit in there but like

212
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,779
and it's softer yeah so you know because

213
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,979
I couldn't tell you what I remembered as

214
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,478
like some certain things are very

215
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:08,519
nostalgic to me but that one I remember

216
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,839
smoking on it yeah it really wasn't a

217
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,339
big deal back then though it was just

218
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,599
because we were there and it happened to

219
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,219
be something that was an offering from

220
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,419
Africa so check this out and tell me

221
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,100
what you think of that so we're gonna do

222
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,500
a little bit of comparative tasting

223
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,900
today or comparative smelling it's kind

224
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,639
of how I do palette training I'll do

225
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,098
like and Haze is a great example because

226
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,720
there's a terpenoline limonene that's so

227
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:30,060
dominant with the haze varieties yeah

228
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,919
this makes sense yeah and so that's a

229
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,538
softer you know that's that's got a nice

230
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,879
soft smell to it we got some super

231
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:37,379
silver you have super silver yeah I got

232
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,939
so nice

233
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,418
um yeah and so the next one we got is

234
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,418
some jack Pereira

235
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:49,318
and then this Jack is real interesting

236
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,959
but but different than the Durban

237
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,879
and then oh you got some Sour Durbin

238
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,620
yeah that's what I was that's what I say

239
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,879
this is not the actual Durban and I

240
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,439
couldn't even tell you this is like the

241
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,060
real dirt this is just fire in general

242
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,379
but I could see it definitely being as

243
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,060
far as Durban because you tell me

244
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,098
because I just smelt this and I told you

245
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,879
to make sense see so this is much more

246
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:10,319
Durbin smelling than that yeah from what

247
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,519
I remember but they still both have a

248
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,800
Jackie

249
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,779
yeah Jackie that Haze that Columbia

250
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,418
undertone right so

251
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:23,399
it's I like it I like it it's fun

252
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:26,219
and then so now the funny thing is is

253
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,959
like with comparative uh

254
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,539
tasting or comparative smelling like

255
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,338
what we're doing

256
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:34,979
so super silver haze now this one is by

257
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,200
far this is from yeah from Chris Yeah

258
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,180
Yeah from Christmas this episode I was

259
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,979
buying so I was like a lot of people

260
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,838
think these smell are exactly the same

261
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,820
but when you have them all side by side

262
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,320
differences yeah so you smell them and

263
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,640
then you go back and smell them and then

264
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,800
you really notice the differences

265
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,139
between them because the tropinoline and

266
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,179
limonene and some of those other

267
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:57,059
terpenes really cancel each other out so

268
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,679
then you start yeah totally but if you

269
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,599
go from that to smell that right away

270
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,939
without smelling the coffee you'll

271
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,300
notice that smells different because the

272
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,740
the strong Haze nose cancels it out so

273
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,899
now all of a sudden you get these like

274
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,899
it's it's like a little bit of fruit I

275
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,940
get on there and maybe some Earth

276
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,500
so it's it's interesting when you

277
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,700
compare because people think hazes all

278
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
smell the same it's not true there's

279
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,000
some stronger than I have to you have to

280
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,339
have seen enough to actually know the

281
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,080
subtle variance is Right other than that

282
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,880
it's just kind of like like for me I

283
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,620
mean runs like I don't know I'm not into

284
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,939
all the hype stuff so I really haven't I

285
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,379
see it when people come to my crib or

286
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,820
something that usually yeah but they go

287
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:34,860
to the club and spend money on it and

288
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,540
then like I see it without homies

289
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,459
that'll be like this is this right this

290
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,319
is this runs and like yeah and they all

291
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,778
are very simple to run so I don't even

292
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,420
remember whiter there's so many renames

293
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:47,700
right so the the yeah fishing and the

294
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,559
Renee [ __ ] is just it's gone I mean

295
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,959
that's prevalent prevalent a lot with

296
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,219
the um the East Coast Vans and [ __ ] you

297
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,079
know I mean like it's like you all know

298
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,040
where the muscle strains came from you

299
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,879
know for sure there's very few that are

300
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,559
actually gonna be able to tell you that

301
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,240
they're gonna tell you where to buy it

302
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,059
and like how it's the best that you've

303
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,139
ever seen and uh you know whatever you

304
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,579
never you've never seen anything better

305
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,019
and they're doing something special yeah

306
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,540
but they're you know they can't tell you

307
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,100
about the weed totally no yeah for a

308
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:12,419
while they were renaming blue dream I

309
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,360
remember that back in the day I was like

310
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,799
it was all

311
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,240
on the East Coast was getting like it

312
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,559
was just typical it was like I knew

313
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,759
Bubba's like I was like I could see

314
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,500
because there was so much was going out

315
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,360
there that like they were gonna start

316
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,799
calling it cookies and eventually I'm

317
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,120
surprised that they were able to do it

318
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,919
because I had heard of people doing that

319
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,320
and I was like no that's just Bubba

320
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,360
because I had seen some of it yeah and

321
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,800
um and yeah like I don't know what the

322
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
like yeah I don't even know how the [ __ ]

323
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,120
people are still messing with Bubba

324
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,100
really but you know I like the 398 Bubba

325
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
because it's good the real Bubble Kush

326
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,940
that you smoke it down to the roach and

327
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,980
it still has that gassy soapy taste I

328
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,480
like it yeah those are the stuff that we

329
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,839
had back in the day yeah you don't see

330
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,700
people producing that anymore

331
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,399
who kept the plan alive that long yeah I

332
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,259
think it's that that one's probably I

333
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,820
mean I can't say nobody did but and it

334
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,439
got replaced with the other Bubble Kush

335
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,420
that everybody knows today as Bubble

336
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,940
Kush that's not as good that finishes in

337
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,679
like 50 days yeah no because it is back

338
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,440
then it was 42 days pretty much like

339
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,299
everything was six weeks yeah we were on

340
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,220
it was like you know money making

341
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:17,039
schedule like those flower rooms are 24

342
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,959
hours 24 hours 12 hours a day on 12

343
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,819
hours off all the time yeah that's it

344
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,939
365 days a year

345
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,620
um excuse me um but uh and then you just

346
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,839
keep the bedroom stock then just keep

347
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,940
the flower room stock that's it and then

348
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,700
like mono we went through mono cropping

349
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,279
I mean see you green like audio thinks

350
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,600
like sag is screen and green when it's

351
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,100
sea of green which is like yeah

352
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,360
completely different screen or green a

353
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,759
lot of people refer to it as like the

354
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,980
trellis netting and whatnot sure is like

355
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,539
no we used to take uh four by four

356
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,100
everything was envelope back then yeah

357
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,059
and it was easy because it was like you

358
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,860
didn't have to be there all the time

359
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,899
because we were just there's too much

360
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,278
going on see you green but the real sea

361
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,600
agreed I mean people

362
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,200
oh

363
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,200
I guess see if

364
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,940
you see him flow and that was a whole

365
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,700
different world we used to do the four

366
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,260
by fours like I think it's 64 per 4x4 or

367
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,480
something like that and it's the 4x4

368
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,679
Rockets small plants yeah just like a

369
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,720
lot of people don't know they're like oh

370
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,578
like and it's it's just like you could

371
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,560
flip it whenever you want before you

372
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:15,239
like while you're trying to clone it you

373
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,739
grow in rockwool or did you grow lava

374
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,019
rock what what did you do back in the

375
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,759
day with that

376
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:21,919
did everything yeah I kind of like the

377
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,720
one right now

378
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,919
hand watering soil you know I could I'm

379
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,899
gonna probably set up irrigation system

380
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,699
like later but I don't mind you know I

381
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,039
always thought soil tasted the best yeah

382
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,120
as long as soils you know yeah I mean

383
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,980
it's like the beginning of personal

384
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,659
stuff you know so it's like I mean why

385
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,940
not you know like it's like [ __ ] like

386
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:40,740
it's the Rockwell for me is just more of

387
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,240
a it's more easier to dial in on a

388
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,100
commercial scale like I'm very like

389
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,259
familiar with it on that scale sure but

390
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,639
like the home tip is definitely always

391
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:49,799
like I don't know this is for myself

392
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,980
anyways you know for my homies so you've

393
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,899
been breeding for a long time I mean or

394
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,879
working with pollen working with you

395
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,440
yeah like I mean that's the same like I

396
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,419
mean I always looking for something

397
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,040
better and like all that like um you

398
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,419
know there's I'm never complacent with

399
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,278
like mediocrity

400
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:06,719
um but um but like I'm always looking

401
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,159
for something better and so it just kind

402
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,200
of came along as a natural progression

403
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,120
between like at some point you hit a

404
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,980
point where you're not really getting

405
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,299
you might be getting like I remember I

406
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,159
was even getting really good weed though

407
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,778
spending money at the club you know yeah

408
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,039
and then one time like I said there's

409
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,500
certain people within your life that

410
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,778
like are kind of pivotal and like

411
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,159
um in motivating you into like going in

412
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:28,379
a certain direction and I was just a

413
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,059
young kid around here in the city and I

414
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,879
remember there was like planet Earth was

415
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,559
on Castro and they had then they know

416
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,139
had the warehouse on Dorman I believe

417
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,719
yeah um but there was West Coast Growers

418
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,120
this guy from like Mendocino who came

419
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,220
down and I walked in that room and it

420
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,839
was like it was all automated like

421
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,360
everything like he was had like lights

422
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,160
on like the Turners and like they would

423
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,600
go like [ __ ] I was like what the and

424
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,699
everything was on drip I was like what

425
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,379
the hell is this fully automated yeah

426
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,060
and he had like it was the first time

427
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,799
that and he was selling these um the

428
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,778
trace stands with like this is like 20

429
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,699
years ago yeah like just [ __ ] that like

430
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,679
to this day is still actually like I

431
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,360
don't know not really that uh just kind

432
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,979
of catching on maybe I don't know yeah

433
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,959
it's not that far off I mean we just

434
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,639
used to use the little Asian

435
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,599
um that likes

436
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,060
um

437
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,860
like I guess stools or whatever but like

438
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,539
just flip them upside down or whatever

439
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,919
and there's still the tray on top oh you

440
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,958
just like yeah yeah we used to make wood

441
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,479
benches like we did wood for a while it

442
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,159
was not the most sterile but also I mean

443
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,659
it was just a lot of work and it was

444
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,278
just like when you're shutting down in

445
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,078
spots and moving you don't want to

446
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,220
happen taking I just had to do a spot

447
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,039
where we had to take apart the wood

448
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,660
tables and it was cool but destroy like

449
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,278
it was like a demo team that had to come

450
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,539
through to take that [ __ ] out right and

451
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,039
then I have to throw away all that wood

452
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:43,019
which supposedly wood at the time was

453
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,879
actually really expensive yeah now we

454
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,839
have rolling tables and all this crazy

455
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:53,458
stuff so so OG KB was that your first

456
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,519
big uh that was your first big cultivar

457
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,899
um I mean I I guess mainly that's the

458
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,060
one I remember attached just because of

459
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,860
the notoriety with it I totally no but I

460
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,719
mean it's it's cool it's a good strain

461
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,399
it's definitely it's a good smoker it

462
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,440
looks crazy it's one of those ones that

463
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,198
has like really mutated kind of look to

464
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,940
it yeah uh but it smokes amazing it's a

465
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,919
good breeder too so he's like yeah

466
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,959
that's so like basically it was back to

467
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,219
that um we were just documenting the

468
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,018
form of the animal and then it was like

469
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,399
oh gkv and OG KV a lot of people are

470
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,740
like they don't know what it even means

471
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,278
it's actually um OG Kush break this like

472
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,480
um uh like an Ode to like the to his his

473

they all know each other but anyways

484
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,278
came into my possession

485
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,500
um those guys at cookie fan were all

486
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,240

487
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,198
of like flag to them or some [ __ ]

488
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,480
because they were bugging me about it

489
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,559
initially and then uh just kind of

490
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,300
turned into like this whole [ __ ] show

491
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,219
that was like really well like I just

492
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,740
had nothing to do with

493
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,699
um but that was really it it was or joji

494
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,320
kushbread like a lot of people don't

495
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,698
even know that you know and it was just

496
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,440
my it was just like literally just a way

497
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:12,179
to differentiate the cuts yeah it was

498
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,800
nothing like cool about it like oh we're

499
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,319
gonna make something next cool strain it

500
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,299
was just names just like I had a plate

501
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,399
that had an animal for him and OG gave

502
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,319
me when I finished it you know yeah and

503
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,639
uh that's that's it it was a way and you

504
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,019
can also tell the plant because of the

505
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,198
fact that you know the plant grew crazy

506
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:29,159
yeah you know and um Justin he got that

507
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,620
plan

508
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,480
um and it was pretty pretty battered oh

509
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,698
yeah yeah but he got lots of pathogens

510
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,539
when I I you can ask him about it I

511
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:37,799
haven't really talked to him about it

512
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,659
but like yeah I mean it was definitely

513
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,039
it was still doing all right in my

514
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:42,419
possession but I definitely wanted to

515
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,799
have it backed up as soon as I could

516
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,819
like it was just getting it was getting

517
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,559
older and when I had gotten it

518
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,879
originally yeah it was probably to this

519
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,159
day like one of the worst plants I've

520
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,600
ever seen like wow it was screwed and I

521
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,980
was like I floured some of it out

522
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,420
because I had to like bring some

523
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,600
flowering plants over my place and all

524
00:16:54,419 --> 00:17:00,958
this stuff and um yeah it was you know

525
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,000
just I just it doesn't vary it doesn't

526
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,259
throw many like um it doesn't take

527
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,539
pollen very well there's a lot of like

528
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:08,699
non-viable seeds I feel like there's a

529
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,379
learning curve too I've never could be

530
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,600
my factors I'm gonna look that far into

531
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,799
it like I mean there's I've seen shitty

532
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,938
versions of it where people grow it out

533
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:16,619
and you could tell it's the right

534
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,480
genetic but it just doesn't look good it

535
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,938
looks like kind of shreds in a bag like

536
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,140
yeah yeah I mean like I said at the end

537
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,720
of the day it's all a grower dude you

538
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,160
know like like uh you know Powers says

539
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,019
uh back in the days you say you never

540
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,840
know the flower the power until you

541
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,519
flower yeah so

542
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,220
um yeah

543
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,019
um you know and then we I harvested it

544
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,279
we figured out that it was like all

545
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,918
other guys that were running the cookies

546
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,298
too they were like oh [ __ ] like this is

547
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,280
cookies like for sure this is like

548
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:45,900
something else but it's cookies yeah and

549
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,038
like unmistakably and then it just kind

550
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,320
of took off from there I never really

551
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,519
gave it to nobody just because not cause

552
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,899
like I was trying to hoard nothing I

553
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,298
actually gave it to homies that helped

554
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,500
me out like even just like moving things

555
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,879
or something like that you know I was

556
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
like whatever I'm just like that you

557
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,299
know and I don't give a [ __ ]

558
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,740
um people and give stuff out as much

559
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:03,359
back in the day no they were definitely

560
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,859
I was just never I'm never stuff close

561
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,298
I'm just yeah I know and that's

562
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:07,379
rightfully so you do whatever you want

563
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:09,000
to do but once you let something out

564
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,480
it's gonna be out like that's the bomb

565
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,099
on yeah it's out yeah yeah I'm not gonna

566
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,298
get mad you know if someone gives me a

567
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,319
clown and they're like oh well you

568
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:18,298
weren't supposed to do this it's like

569
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,259
then don't give it to me like I don't

570
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,179
want to [ __ ] have to keep talking

571
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,500
it's always been I got workers at my

572
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,880
crib or something you know like that old

573
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,200
you know whatever like my mommy's like

574
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,720
they know whatever they you know just

575
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,558
grab take some Cuts whatever yeah oh

576
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,600
[ __ ]

577
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,160
yeah I mean we try to hold stuff close

578
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:33,319
still so there's stuff that and you know

579
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,400
and now

580
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,740
it's a little different now because

581
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,179
everything's yeah like uh there's things

582
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,798
are worth a lot more money and there's a

583
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,360
lot you start writing contracts back

584
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,400
then it was like a ways I mean even the

585
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,798
contracts are not really I mean it's not

586
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,600
100 but but at least there's contraction

587
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,558
for all that [ __ ] I mean like you gotta

588
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,538
have the money for that and if you're

589
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,160
really going against a big dog like a

590
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,940
big company it's a little harder yeah

591
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,160
but um but yeah so um

592
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,080
but now there's a lot more value within

593
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,840
like the intellectual property that you

594
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,859
possess you know so plants are just like

595
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,918
a very

596
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,859
like grayish area you know so sure

597
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,759
things get out you know everyone always

598
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,379
someone's helping somebody and then

599
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,940
something gets out and then everyone

600
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,980
starts hoarding it or like you know

601
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,419
whatever or someone finds a seat in it

602
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,500
and then that's out you know I think

603
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,059
that's happened quite a bit over the

604
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,519
years sometimes the seeds are better

605
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,720
than the original yeah and it honestly

606
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,160
like it's like like you know I give

607
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,279
people all the time too like about like

608
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
OG KB or whatever and um they're you

609
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,700
know like they'll send me pictures I'm

610
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,079
like I can't tell you like this is mine

611
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,640
you didn't get it from me and I'm not

612
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,859
saying you had to have gotten it from me

613
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,840
yeah but I can't tell you out of a

614
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:41,519
picture validate things yeah yeah

615
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,439
because they just wanted to be like oh

616
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,720
like so and so said it's like it's it's

617
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,298
his cut and I was like whoa dude I

618
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,579
didn't say all that you know like it's

619
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,139
uh yeah but I always tell people saying

620
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:54,538
[ __ ] like Instagram doesn't tell the

621
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,880
whole story yeah for sure people want to

622
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:57,960
show you what they wanted yeah and a lot

623
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,240
of stuff looks good on Instagram but

624
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,558
then you get to smoke it and sometimes

625
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,940
the first hit tastes good or sometimes

626
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:04,259
it doesn't taste good at all tons of

627
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,120
stuff looks good like like I said like

628
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,798
all this stuff like um like you know all

629
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,839
this new stuff I call it like dryer Lynn

630
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,339
smelling weird because it's like when I

631
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,199
was like back in the days hustling and

632
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:15,058
stuff coming up um we'd get the pad

633
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,700

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,460
the 90s and [ __ ] you know like they like

649
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:46,798
you you don't people don't understand

650
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,720
what what how Innovative the plant is

651
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,879
and how how you actually can manipulate

652
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,038
it and how far it can actually go yeah

653
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,020
and how far it has yet to go really like

654
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,599
once the other rules factors come into

655
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:59,220
play for sure so yeah

656
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,219
so you got some flower to show us today

657
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,660
yeah so I mean there's a bunch of stuff

658
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,058
um

659
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:10,340
we have

660
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:10,339
let's see this is a Dosey dose

661
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,819
foreign playing

662
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,140
I feel like moonbow

663
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,000
is one of my favorites like when done

664
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,200
I've seen it like a couple times and I I

665
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,519
don't I never actually got it from

666
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,220
Fletcher himself

667
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,960
um but uh but like whatever I did see

668
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,880
was good like it ain't and it comes from

669
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,319
reputable people so I I you know I trust

670
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,700
their judgment you know that's really

671
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,700
that goes a long ways to me too yeah

672
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,620
where it has the frost of the doci and

673
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,058
then you get like it's not just it's not

674
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,219
like Diet Skittles it's like a

675
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:48,658
complexity you smoke it it tastes

676
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,038
amazing you smoke it down the roaches

677
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,120
still tastes good I like yeah and

678
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,158
there's a bunch of different females

679
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,678
that are all pretty good yeah I mean I

680
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,840
think a lot of it like I said uh from

681
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,620
like like modern day like whatever we

682
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,240
know

683
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,558
um nutrients have a lot to do with all

684
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,298
that stuff for sure you know what I mean

685
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:04,798
so and like Growers you know so like you

686
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:06,900
can see the genetic potential within a

687
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,700
plan if you grow really well once but if

688
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,080
you you know you might have a if it's

689
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,360
really good you know I think that's the

690
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,980
cookies actually kind of revolutionize

691
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,038
stuff in a sense because it was able to

692
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,599
like bring along that brand name like it

693
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,798
was came at a time where weed wasn't

694
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,240
getting that much money it was on the

695
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,859
way down and it actually everyone was

696
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,259
starting to pay for seated packs again

697
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:28,859
yeah like what the [ __ ]

698
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,419
um but um yeah yeah no it's crazy but

699
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:33,359
like it carried on that thing is it

700
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:36,000
definitely had that that bag appeal like

701
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,359
and it was um it did have a different

702
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,369
taste uh interesting turbine profile you

703
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,740
know

704
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:41,879
[Music]

705
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,500
um

706
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,240
so yeah and then there's this books on

707
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,400
this yeah sure

708
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,259
yeah so floor flame I feel like it just

709
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,440
keeps getting better and better and

710
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:54,179
better I mean living soil he was on the

711
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,159
show well it's supposed to get better as

712
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,720
the more easy yeah right I mean yeah my

713
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,280
best friend is eight like back in the

714
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,600
days we used to toss everything so we

715
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,339
would never dream of some [ __ ] like that

716
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,079
yeah but it's really it's like farming

717
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,899
that's how you [ __ ] Farm yeah you

718
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,418
know it's like it's it's uh it's a

719
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,159
little more you know labor intense for

720
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,960
sure the Cure on this stuff is so nice

721
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,419
though yeah well you got a refrigerated

722
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,620
[ __ ] fully yeah he's keeping it below

723
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,299
six yeah he's doing everything right

724
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,298
yeah there's no like yeah

725
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,679
yeah

726
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:29,519
what else you got over there the poison

727
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,380
gushers some Chef fuel gelato dude I'm a

728
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,960
big fan of that poison gushers oh yeah I

729
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,000
like it too like I honestly like I get a

730
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,798
um I've had a lot of that in the sherbet

731
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,419
room and honestly like

732
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,058
I like them either way but poison

733
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,679
gushers usually my go-to yeah it gets

734
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:46,440
you high it gets you really high too

735
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,600
it's it's nice I I think it checks the

736
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,700
boxes for me it checks all the boxes I

737
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,740
feel like it's got the flavor

738
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,340
here's some fritter

739
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,940
these two right here let's see

740
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,939
sorry

741
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,600
so these are interesting because these

742
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,100
are my homie Nas yeah he does uh

743
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,359
he's does [ __ ] good work though I've

744
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,000
been here on that [ __ ] for like two

745
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,619
weeks I don't remember the gelato 25. it

746
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,500
was uh he he was probably he got in on

747
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,599
it kind of right early I remember the

748
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,779
23.

749
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,879
there was a 33 which is probably 33 and

750
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,819
the 40 were my favorites but the 45 was

751
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,140
pretty cool that was like super purple

752
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:29,460
they were all like not bad it's just

753
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,460
nothing like for me it's gotta be

754
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,079
something like like there's certain

755
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,640
things that did like Game Changer [ __ ]

756
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,839
like I see it and I'm like wow like I

757
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,240
like that a lot better like I would

758
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,399
almost make this a staple on a menu

759
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,700
um that stuff too that uh so apple

760
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,200
fritter is like one of my least favorite

761
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,120
genetics and the thing is is like it

762
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,819
smells so good and it smells like apples

763
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,038
you get this apple pie smelt it but the

764
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,720
problem is is when I go to smoke it you

765
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,980
don't get that Apple taste and that's

766
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,620
the one thing I don't like about it I

767
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,419
think it's great it looks good but it's

768
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,339
not my choice I feel like a lot of the

769
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,580
apples and bananas um I mean this stuff

770
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:08,699
was growing [ __ ] immaculately though

771
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:10,558
um but uh I feel like um

772
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,900
yeah I mean a lot of this stuff is just

773
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,639
like you it's like it all comes down to

774
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,019
basically who whoever grew up best you

775
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,520
know I mean like it's I'm a huge fan of

776
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,839
apples and bananas though yeah I know

777
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,819
it's got that that's what I was gonna

778
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,859
get at it's like um but it's not super

779
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,019
Appley either it's more like GDP kind of

780
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:28,158
knows it reminds me let's see Africa

781
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:31,980
yeah it runs somewhere between

782
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,778
GDP that's kind of I just like avgu was

783
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,220
probably closer down like that was one

784
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:37,259
of the I used to grow that stuff and it

785
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,240
was like kind of big super sweet bad

786
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:41,519
aota

787
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,259
all the above that [ __ ] was yeah so you

788
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,960
were going back that that's a way back

789
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:49,440
that that's like early to mid 2000s I'm

790
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,860
old man yeah I feel you so the aota yeah

791
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,080
I mean I think so that afghoo was sweet

792
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,500
and it yielded it and it was super super

793
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:00,418
Frosty but other than Apples and Bananas

794
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,000
I feel like that terpene profile came

795
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,380
through like I said it's it's uh I've

796
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,759
been looking to get that real ask you

797
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,840
back but the after that we have is

798
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,099
different here than it is over overseas

799
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,418
originally it was a big humble staple

800
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:15,119
like totally that's where I got it from

801
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,799
originally help me up I'm uh he's uh he

802
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,658
has Shepherd's Meadow he does super

803
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,158
great work because this is a farmer what

804
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,620
not he's dope

805
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,179
um so yeah he that's kind of how I got

806
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,558
into a lot of this stuff too you know

807
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:28,500
you use one of the first people that was

808
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:31,259
growing dude it won a cup in like 2006

809

811
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,798
the above that was a good one

812
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,900
I mean there's this is a glitter bomb so

813
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,700
this is from Sans yeah so tell us a

814
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,400
little bit about the glitter bomb I like

815
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,720
that it was basically I mean it's I I

816
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,980
just approach everything the way I do

817
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,640
man it's like

818
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,038
um

819
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,400
like I I had done some outdoor runs with

820
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,599
OG KV and then I pollinated them and I

821
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
still have a bunch of those seats too

822
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,839
that I still gotta sort through those

823
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,580
ones though I got down to like there

824
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,619
wasn't that many of those gkvs in

825
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:03,960
general yeah because like there was a

826
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,678
lot of non-viable seeds you know

827
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,778
um

828
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,659
so I did that to a Blu-ray headband that

829
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:12,720
I did and then I grew those out and I

830
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:15,900
gave Chris the female that I selected

831
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,038
um Chris from compound yeah and

832
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,600
um and then yeah I just went over there

833
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,859
and then just uh I was like yeah dude

834
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,599
let's [ __ ] make some happen let's see

835
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:23,639
you know cross someone your males and

836
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,019
nice you know I didn't know if they were

837
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,659
you know I didn't I didn't foresee like

838
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,980
them taking it like uh you know as far

839
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,299
as marketing it the way they wanted to

840
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,460
Market it which is great you know yeah

841
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:33,960
they did a really a hell of a job

842
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,120
um but it is good weed it's like it's

843
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,159
eye candy it's got It's got that it's

844
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,719
it's definitely photogenic yeah no

845
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,159
that's what I'm saying it's like if it

846
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,659
wasn't I'd be like uh I mean I'll be the

847
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,760
first one to tell you you know yeah it's

848
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,820
got unique troops too for sure it stands

849
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,619
out in the back yeah you know but my

850
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:51,480
only complaint is you take one the first

851
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,579
hits taste amazing but down at the roach

852
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,099
on the refire it doesn't taste quite as

853
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,259
good as some stuff but initially the

854
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,899
flavor is amazing again that's so and

855
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,038
that could be grower yeah

856
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,298
I always default that because that's

857
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:04,500
kind of what we've always been told you

858
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:06,658
know and everyone else wants a spout

859
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,980
that so right but the reality is like

860
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,900
I've seen a lot of good stuff through

861
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,000
Athena like I'm not gonna lie like

862
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,320
there's nothing there's no reason to lie

863
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,278
like you know I've obviously yeah I've

864
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,778
tasted good weed from pretty much

865
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,480
probably every nutrient company never

866
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:21,240
had a complaint there's very little

867
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,798
I can't really I remember like good we

868
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,960
better than I remember bad reader that

869
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,179
way that's a good thing memorable when

870
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,460
stuff is just like you know when it's

871
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,320
bad it's like oh [ __ ] like uh I'm not

872
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,659
gonna know names but I gotta like

873
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,819
um I met these dudes they had a really

874
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,320
flashy booth and all this [ __ ] talked to

875
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:39,240
him they had like a touch screen and all

876
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:40,319
this stuff and yeah and all that I was

877
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,940

878
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,740

879
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,940
cool they got like you know he's like

880
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,259
yeah you take some there's a couple in

881
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,480
there I was like all right no dude and I

882
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:49,980
was you know smoking on the way home and

883
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,538
then like yeah it was pretty bad I

884
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,940
pretty much couldn't smoke it it

885
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:55,079
wouldn't say lit so wow yeah I know I

886
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,700
wouldn't complain much I'm not really

887
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,139
excited I think if you got a good if

888
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,179
you're gonna do a pre-roll you gotta do

889
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,038
it right it's got I mean anymore it's so

890
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,019
competitive you want a amazing pre-roll

891
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:05,278
I mean whether it's to show your brand

892
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:06,679
off that you're just giving away or

893
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,058
whether you're selling them it doesn't

894
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,679
tell me you have to do like the whole

895
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:12,298
giveaway [ __ ] it's like I don't just

896
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,038
give you my [ __ ] if I really want you to

897
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:16,019
have it like yeah it ain't I don't want

898
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:17,940
no cheap [ __ ] with my name on it no

899
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:20,339
that's silly whatever you're gonna get

900
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,919
it's gonna look nice I mean that that

901
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:24,658
may have worked in the beginning or or

902
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,980
medical in 2012 where you could give

903
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,720
stuff away and people were happy but

904
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,058
people they're not gonna come back and

905
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,079
then I feel bad because I like as a

906
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:32,759
person that's pays for this sort of

907
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,500
stuff I mean it's just not cheap you

908
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,240
know I don't ask for prices I just want

909
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,700
it done the way I want it yeah and like

910
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,019
unfortunately that if people want to buy

911
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,399
it that's on them but it's going to be

912
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:43,019
quality you know and it's not going to

913
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,879
be you're going to get like you know

914
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,019
you're gonna you should be happy with

915
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,220
what you get

916
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,038
you know

917
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,720
I think with clothing it's easier to

918
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,819
it's kind of easier to convince somebody

919
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,220
that's good then it's more subjective

920
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,558
with clothing yeah no than actually then

921
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,778
then weed too though we can be we can be

922
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,579
subjective it can be everything yeah we

923
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,380
all have different palettes yeah and

924
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:06,058
what one person likes you know I would

925
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,200
say everybody's gonna like cat piss if

926
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,819
you give them some cat because I like

927
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,319
happiness but and I'm sure I'll still

928
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,639
try it here and there you know like I'm

929
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,798
not I wouldn't be going by like a pound

930
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,299
of smoking to the face silver haze like

931
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,619
I probably would you know and then I'd

932
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:17,940
have homies that come I smoked a bunch

933
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,678
of that super stuff I've probably gone

934
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,179
through a good amount yeah a lot like

935
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,460
right when I saw was like boom this is

936
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,899
like Cannabis Cup like yeah wow it's old

937
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,519
school yeah it's old school it's

938
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,558
everything I like about Amsterdam yeah

939
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,720
wow it's right there yeah I know we and

940
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,019
then um like someone like we he had like

941
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,659
a lot of people get like they had a um

942
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,298
um nycd he did Selma dude a lot of

943
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,980
people yeah yeah she was fire but people

944
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:43,859
still think that's like a diesel type of

945
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,360
like it's not diesel though that's so

946
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:46,859
far from diesel yeah it totally

947
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,479
frustrates me too it's like you don't

948
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:49,979
know then you know like like when you

949
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,460
start growing like what

950
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,860
yeah I bred that into the uh

951
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,600
sage and sour and oh yeah see that's

952
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:59,819
like that was from DNA or who was that

953
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,619
was from uh th seeds right they were

954
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:04,079
like one of the first shops in Amsterdam

955
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,339
right yeah yeah for sure absolutely they

956
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,658
were the first for this yeah they were

957
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:08,038
then yeah because I remember that's

958
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:10,559
exactly right around the time they had

959
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,240
moved out today Amsterdam yeah yeah uh

960
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,298
like right when I had gone out there 7

961
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,859
10 Adam and I are doing a drop uh Sage

967
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,418
sour is definitely very

977
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,100
best dispensary weed that I've ever

978
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,599
smoked like I've ever bought and I used

979
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:50,939
to go back and buy these guys in Santa

980
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,459
Cruz I believe used to sell it to

981

Harborside and it's not like sour

982
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,778
doesn't have the sour structure has this

983
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,038
very like the the way the calyx stack is

984
00:31:57,778 --> 00:32:00,659
kind of like sour but it's more like

985
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,538
Williams Wonder one of those ones that's

986
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:05,760

989
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:14,220

00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:23,519
both

995
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,559
um I feel like a sage like

996
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,119
I like it but when it's burning it's a

997
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:28,379
little too offensive but I like kind of

998
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,939
getting the whiff of it when I pass by

999

1126
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,240
whatnot I guess and whatever I was doing

1127
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,039
we we had some stuff called the juicy

1128
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,539
fruit that came down I'm not sure where

1129
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,619
it came from actually now at this point

1130
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,719
but

1131
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,000
it came to the bay and we like we got it

1132
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,199
and it tasted it was like Skittles on

1133
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,940
the level of the sweetness of the

1134
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,379
Skittles but it was like Juicy Fruit

1135
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,059
bubble gum like the gum yeah yeah it

1136
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,039
tasted just like it was Juicy Fruit and

1137
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:03,000
it tasted and then I started noticing

1138
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:05,219
everything started getting called the

1139
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,199
Juicy Fruit yeah dude there's a bunch of

1140
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:08,519
fake juicy Foods that's gone around yeah

1141
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,019
and I didn't I didn't know at the time

1142
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:11,940
like you know like it was renamed golden

1143
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,920
ghost I didn't realize weed was a plant

1144
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,838
like it ain't like my mom caught me

1145
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,338
growing weiner in her closet and she was

1146
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,779
like she's wondering what the hell that

1147
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,719
light was and then

1148
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,280
um and um and she's like what is I was

1149
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,679
like oh it's just plants and then she's

1150
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,480
like and then like she's like oh is that

1151
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,338
weed or whatever and I was like well

1152
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,199
yeah and she's like but that's not weed

1153
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:32,880
that's a plant and I was like yeah it's

1154
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,618
a plant and that's and that was probably

1155
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,599
a little bit after I figured out that it

1156
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,940
was a plant and I was like she was like

1157
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,140
oh wow it smells good and you know but

1158
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,159
she never smoked we in your life or

1159
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:43,139
anything she really didn't like it at

1160
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,899
all she didn't she does not want this

1161
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:48,118
for me so she started with one light or

1162
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,500
two lights I started going into that

1163
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,099
store West Coast Guards and I was like

1164
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,019
oh [ __ ] like yeah whoa like damn so I

1165
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,099
get home and my eyes was my chick at the

1166
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:58,079
time

1167
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,640
um and I tore everything out of the out

1168
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,880
of my closet I had like a cool like

1169
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,920
right like three by five I would say and

1170
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,720
I was doing soil so I did two sixes in

1171
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,220
there and I like drilled the holes in

1172
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,379
the and I don't even know how to operate

1173
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,480
tools I was so young you know yeah I was

1174
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,800
like banging away it was like the one in

1175
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,900
the morning or I'm almost trying to go

1176
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,940
to sleep my girl was like all the

1177
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,039
clothes was everywhere and then I had a

1178
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,838
portable air conditioner in there

1179
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,820
um that didn't last too long like you

1180
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,219
know obviously my cable bill jumped up

1181
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,740
crazy they they you know you don't think

1182
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:29,819
about these things

1183
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:31,319
yeah and it's creating heat as a

1184
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,079
byproducts so the room was a lot and

1185
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,820
then I was you know like it's yeah it's

1186
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,740
I like I said I've tried everything it's

1187
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,838
it's uh I've wasted a lot of money doing

1188
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:41,159
it too I used to buy like I used to be

1189
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,960
that person buying 30 bottles of

1190
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:44,819
different like now things are I feel

1191
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,139
like are more simplified so much more

1192
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,300
simplified we used to we didn't want

1193
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:49,980
recipes that we were like you know like

1194
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,200
do certain things for us we had to like

1195
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,358
figure out how to do it I always got my

1196
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,980
best results from where it was the least

1197
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,679
amount of stuff though I didn't need it

1198
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,699
yeah yeah and then you could but you

1199
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,159
don't want to be turning your lights on

1200
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:03,419
and off every day you know like so a lot

1201
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,519
of timers back then they wouldn't even

1202
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,820
handle the amperage of like a 1 000 watt

1203
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,259
light right so you know like it's yeah

1204
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,640
they made them better but like there's

1205
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,980
other things like you know controlling

1206
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,259
your CO2 I was running that closet with

1207
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,019
CO2 and then I realized I had to do a

1208
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,880
closed loop so I was running the the air

1209
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,679
through the lights the two 600s and then

1210
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,500
going back up in the roof so I would be

1211
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,578
popping it full of CO2 and then

1212
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,219
um yeah I was running by all this

1213
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,380
nutrients I mean I I love that stuff um

1214
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:34,559
it just doesn't really doesn't hold well

1215
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,240
in in reservoirs at all so I think the

1216
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,460
newer by how long has it been since used

1217
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,078
by oh that was my first thing yeah so

1218
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,760
they've changed their stuff oh yeah of

1219
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,920
course they were really introducing the

1220
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,480
bio Heaven I believe when I kind of

1221
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,159
started veering away from it wow and

1222
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,900
then I went on The Cutting Edge and then

1223
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:50,460
I like Cutting Edge still yeah I like

1224
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,720
Cutting Edge because they're local and I

1225
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,760
like you know and they're cool people

1226
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:57,419
I've talked to them yeah and uh I just

1227
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,460
don't like I can't I I mean needing

1228
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,780
moving barrels of nutrients is not you

1229
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,880
know you need a forklift for that you

1230
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,160
know so it's like I'd rather have a lot

1231
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,838
of powder and you know it's a little

1232
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:08,879
easier it's better for the Earth for one

1233
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,900
thing but yeah I guess it yeah I mean I

1234
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,980
think it's better it's better for your

1235
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,079
back better for the Earth it's better

1236
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,719
for a lot of things yeah

1237
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,760
um you know and and there's interesting

1238
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,980
you know products that aren't made with

1239
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,960
salts necessary but I like salt I think

1240
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,338
it's a yeah you're gonna go that right

1241
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,900
if you're not going living soil you're

1242
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:27,119
going and then I try I try everything

1243
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,858
and like there's like I couldn't say I

1244
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,140
was disappointed in anything really if

1245
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:32,578
it was it was because it didn't but I'm

1246
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:34,559
doing seed production I'm using cocoa

1247
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,400
and I'm using salts typically yeah and I

1248
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,139
experiment with a lot of different

1249
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,240
things but I did that's pretty much yeah

1250
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:41,699
I like cocoa a lot you know like um but

1251
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,479
like I I just don't like using

1252
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,098
um

1253
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,800
like the dirt that I got was from bio

1254
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:48,059
365 they do a pretty good job about like

1255
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,220
what they're doing I'm really happy with

1256
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,900
their dirt I would use that here but I

1257
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,939
can't do it because it's not sterile

1258
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,099
that's the only thing oh is it well I

1259
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,440
mean you can get bucks potentially I

1260
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:00,119
mean

1261
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,460
they have sterile cocoa sterile cocoa

1262
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,380
and Rockwell we do rockets mostly yeah

1263
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,240
it's sterilized yeah see back then like

1264
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,519
I mean we didn't even we were just doing

1265
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,618
Royal gold defaulting and we were

1266
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,179
putting our bags in like black contract

1267
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,338
bags and loading them and that's why I

1268
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,838
like when powder came into play I was

1269
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,799
like you could just do this instead of

1270
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,380
curious

1271
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,180
six gallon you know like three part

1272
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,280
nutrients you know like it's like 50

1273
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:26,879
pounds a piece yeah like yeah it's a lot

1274
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,500
a lot easier you know yeah so yeah I

1275
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,059
mean it's like I said I've tried to like

1276
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,719
House and Garden

1277
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:34,559
um

1278
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:36,480
I I all sorts of stuff and three-part

1279
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,099
um the house and garden no no three-part

1280
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,019
oh then another the original was always

1281
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,760
Lucas yeah yeah it was like I mean it

1282
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:44,338
was the original three-part but yeah

1283
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,540
like most people if you knew that you

1284
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:47,279
know that you didn't have to buy that

1285
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:49,380
that should that the grill yeah totally

1286
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,780
so yeah like it's like you just get by

1287
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,700
on the mic around the bloom and um yeah

1288
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,200
and I mean I still know people I mean it

1289
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:58,799
worked it's like it's not gonna go

1290
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,838
anywhere like it's gonna work like so we

1291
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,460
used to use Jacks like you know out of

1292
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:03,358
Home Depot and [ __ ] yeah you know it

1293
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,980
worked

1294
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:05,759
Josh was good that was the blue stuff

1295
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,559
right

1296
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,020
I don't even remember man it was like

1297
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,639
that's like a long time ago I don't know

1298
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:13,320
if they still make it I think it's the

1299
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:14,699
one part they have it in agriculture

1300
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,160
houses you can get it in like a lot yeah

1301
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,719
yeah and it worked I could like that's

1302
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,980
why I kind of really want to do these

1303
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,139
blind taste tests where I would

1304
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,179
purposely use that sort of stuff and

1305
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,980
then you know for sure and it's like

1306
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:28,078
there's no names attached it's a

1307
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,579
completely blind like and it's just a

1308
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,960
hangout like I'll we'll have an event

1309
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,060
we'll have a hangout everyone will be

1310
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,440
chilling smugging whatever comparing

1311
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:36,239
notes you know maybe have a

1312
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,400
questionnaire with each one like checks

1313
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,199
and boxes you know and then they all get

1314
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,059
thrown in and then the results get

1315
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,519
calculated by a computer yeah you know

1316
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,980
about the numbers and then we go by that

1317
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:49,858
that's what people chose and so if you

1318
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,960
don't like it minority yeah I mean

1319
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:55,940

like a lounge you know really like

1338

1343
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,339
all but yeah that's great once you stop

1344
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,779
drinking you realize how much it costs

1345
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:44,519
and you're like damn like how much money

1346

my meals are like less than half off I'm

1348
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,680
like what and then you know that's right

1349
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,179
that's one thing but before it was like

1350
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,799
oh I'm waiting at the airport all right

1351

1352
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,940
it's like soda now to have a drink you

1353
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,259
know but like it just adds up and like

1354
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,519
really it's not a good look yeah I'm

1355
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,440
still trying not to drink I don't drink

1356
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,119

they offer you a free drink it's like I

1359
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,599
was free drink but yeah that was a

1360
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,240
problem too it's like I was on a plane

1361

00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,179
smoking so but either way I'm looking at

1364
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:20,039
venues currently and whatnot and like

1365
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:21,838

though but it's not cheap I don't know I

1372
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:33,358
feel like it's getting cheaper I mean I

1373
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:35,159
don't plan on making money I mean a lot

1374

1376
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,599
like I don't think about throwing

1377
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:41,760
anything to make money I mean I might

1378

bring stuff and like if you know it's a

1379
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,180
cool place to like showcase things but

1380
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:46,739
I'm not really a Salesman like that's

1381
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:48,299

1388
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:02,818
if I could break even at the end of the

1389

1393
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,720

1410
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,739
part of you I don't see me taking on

00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,220
knew it was Robert Connell Clark you

1421
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:07,318

1422

1425
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,059
Frank

1426
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:19,039
yes yeah okay yeah yeah yeah because

1427
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:22,199
yeah

1428
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,599
yeah okay yeah so I got it mixed up yeah

1429
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,098
but those guys and Ed you know they put

1430
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:27,960
out the girl books back in the day yeah

1431
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,700
those were those were all great they

1432
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,380
were all good they were all interesting

1433
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:33,239
I mean I think some of the stuff is

1434
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,500
outdated of course but you know I mean

1435
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,358
that's of course it was the beginning of

1436
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,800
an industry you know yeah emergency

1437
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:39,719
stages you know what I mean like yeah

1438
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,818
but some of the stuff still holds true a

1439
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:42,959
lot of it is really nostalgic for me you

1440
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:45,119
know I'm still working on my breeding

1441
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,920
book I think we're hoping that it's done

1442
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,660
yeah the last thing came out the Greg

1443
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,280
Green's breeders Bible I think yeah I

1444
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:51,779
read I got a breeding book that's that's

1445
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,819
full-on reading everything about

1446
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,040
breeding it's you know we got a lot of

1447
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:57,719
uh pictures that are going in that our

1448
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:59,818
photographers Julie dialed in so it's

1449
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:01,439
building the facility at the same time

1450
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,179
is really helpful when you're writing a

1451
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,700
book because you can do step by step and

1452
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:07,019
actually show the the parts the cutting

1453
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:08,639
clones you can show that you can show

1454
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:10,440
germinating seeds and all this stuff so

1455
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,059
yeah no I'm very big on like taking

1456
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,318
pictures of things that are progressing

1457
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:14,578
and then you can kind of go back and

1458
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:16,318
pick whether you even want to put it up

1459
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:18,000
or we you know what you want totally and

1460
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,440
showing your work isn't a bad thing I

1461
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,639
feel like showing your work showing that

1462
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,539
you're actually doing the breeding

1463
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,578
you're doing the work you're doing the

1464
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:24,838
phenotes all that stuff is great you

1465
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,000
know people can talk about it all day

1466
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:29,338
but show your work yeah no I mean it's

1467
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,900
like and honestly like I I like I'm not

1468
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:32,400
like you said about the whole breeder

1469
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,920
question like I wouldn't consider myself

1470
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,300
a reader I breed strains I don't I look

1471
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,039
for better and I do what a typical

1472
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,318
breeder would

1473
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,179
um you know but I'm I don't really spend

1474
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,980
too much time like making lines and all

1475
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:45,719
that I just kind of visit things and if

1476
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,039
they work and I like it then you know

1477
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:48,358
whatever I'd actually rather spread it

1478
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,739
out and get it to people you know yeah

1479
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:51,358
like I said like with my weed like I

1480
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:52,500
have you know my homies come through I

1481
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:53,940
want to see what they got to say about

1482
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,559
it you know like it's like I don't want

1483
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,760
to smoke it all in my face but you're

1484
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:58,318
looking for winners and you're popping

1485
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,579
seeds yeah well that's why I buy this

1486
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:00,779
too so it's like I want to know what you

1487
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:02,579
think about about these winners some

1488
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,099
people are like oh this kind of smells

1489
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,300
black and I'm like but it's good weed

1490
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,859
and it's like the hardest part about

1491
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,880
breeding is actually finding the winners

1492
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:10,219
you know I mean at the end of the day

1493
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,420
that's the real yeah

1494
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:14,159
like you know you know more losers than

1495
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,599
I see winners like that's the one thing

1496
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,399
like I'll post about regret room

1497
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,559
failures like you know or like pests

1498
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,680
whatever final product like you know

1499
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:26,578
like it's like it's um

1500
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:29,039
yeah it's it's it's you it's it's very

1501
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,599
subjective as far as like um which what

1502
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,099
you're gonna get well there's Keepers

1503
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,900
and winners and then there's complete

1504
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:35,338
like that aren't gonna work you know

1505
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,200
just like yeah it depends on what you're

1506
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:38,460
looking for too sometimes in a 10-pack

1507
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:39,779
but the thing that's so subjective

1508
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,760
because there's a lot of times I pop a

1509
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,440
10 pack and not find anything oh yeah

1510
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,000
and you can call it a keeper but is it

1511
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,260
it's not gonna be something that I've

1512
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,179
been lucky to run a lot of good stuff

1513
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,920
like Fletcher's old stuff I I don't know

1514
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:51,419
I haven't read any of his new stuff

1515
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,740
really because I haven't uh there's

1516
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,659
definitely something I want it's just

1517
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,979
more of like yeah you know I have to get

1518
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:57,358
it so

1519
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,639
um and I've been busy doing other stuff

1520
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,440
but Adam up in Portland archive grows

1521
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:02,699
amazing yeah they sent me a couple some

1522
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,900
seeds too but like it's also like I'm

1523
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:05,818
dealing with some stuff right now like

1524
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,619
yeah you know where I need it like

1525
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,300
pretty much I'm not gonna crack those

1526
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:11,818
until I got a clean space to do it at

1527
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,200
and like usually my place I I like do a

1528
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:15,300
lot of my projects experiencing I

1529
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,159
[ __ ] a lot like you know just to see

1530
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,720
how things work out and I really will

1531
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:20,940
probably kind of know how it works out

1532
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:23,279
but you know still like experimenting

1533
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,900
yeah I do I like I love doing things I

1534
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,900

uh laptop cases you know like like you

1536
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,700

big and done really dope rooms yeah you

1539

1540
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,699
and like honestly like I don't it's just

1541
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,098
