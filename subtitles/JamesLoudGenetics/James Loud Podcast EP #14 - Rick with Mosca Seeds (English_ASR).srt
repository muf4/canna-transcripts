having me James awesome so I guess let's

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,058
get started and talk about your history

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,000
and how you came up in the industry well

20
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:58,799
you know it was really it's always been

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,878
a love for the plant and when I was 13

22
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:06,239
um my uh relatives who lived in Iowa

23
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:09,539
showed me these huge 15-foot uh hemp

24
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:13,978
plants asking us if we knew what that

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:18,118
was we had no clue we got a a garbage

26
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:21,259
paper garbage bag full of flour and uh

27
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,180
we took it home with us back to Illinois

28
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:27,540
thinking that uh this is really potent

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,880
good stuff and it did nothing but give

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,860
us headaches we tried to cure it in

31
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:38,879
mason jars with apple slices oranges and

32
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,859
all I did was mold yeah it uh yeah that

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,679
that was the beginning of it and then

34
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,920
you know uh throughout

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,740
um uh going to school in the Summers I

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,960
worked at an orchid farm near my home

37
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,859
and that that's really where I learned

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:58,019
more about cultivation growing

39
00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:03,259
and then uh

40
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:06,478
I traveled to Amsterdam back in 1999

41
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:11,038
and to me to be able to see people

42
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:14,580
smoking freely uh in coffee shops uh was

43
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:18,958
just an eye-opening experience and at

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,959
that time for me uh my whole goal was to

45
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,780
grow flower as good as I could buy in

46
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,878
Amsterdam coffee shops oh wow and uh

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:33,000
weren't setting your goals too high yeah

48
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:35,399
so was this in the 90s yeah late 1999

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,800
was the first time was it Amsterdam

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,560
awesome and the green the greenhouse was

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,540
one of the first ones I went to and I

52
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,840
still have a big blown up portrait of

53
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,000
their menu and I keep up on my wall just

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,340
to remind me of uh really cool again

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,818
yeah I still have my bobble head from

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,719
Aryan oh right the Cannabis yes yes yeah

57
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:03,000
that was great uh share space uh at his

58
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,919
Booth this year at spanubus yeah that

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,860
was really cool that was really cool it

60
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,199
was I I hate to say but I think it was

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,760
my best fan of us ever like I had a

62
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,199
really good time I think we had a lot of

63
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,899
fun

64
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,759
for me it was more fun than it's been in

65
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,760
the past even though we worked our asses

66
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,500
off I wasn't having to manage multiple

67
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,359
seed companies it was just you and I

68
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,860
hanging out with Greenhouse you know

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,159
that that by itself was a lot of fun

70
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,980
yeah much more efficient I think and

71
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,739
um to see all our old friends from you

72
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,139
know our past and that was really

73
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,799
tremendous to see old faces and to

74
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:43,679
connect uh with Mila yeah at the uh the

75
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,840
squash off that was that was fantastic

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,180
one of our highlights definitely

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,340
squash off was really cool you know I

78
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,319
I've seen it before many times this was

79
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,939
the first time I judged and I've been

80
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,719
friends with Uncle Stoner for a long

81
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:00,479

86
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,318
yeah it was a really great event I

87
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,419
thought it was a lot of fun uh being

88
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,458
able to contribute Ken Estes was there

89
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,519

92
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,939
beautiful event for cannabis people

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,979
coming together

94
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,779
uh I just I I can't speak highly enough

95
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,399
of the event

96
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:32,459
um it's my favorite Gathering of friends

97
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:36,418
especially right and see that number of

98
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:39,299
people and just having a great time you

99
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,399
know talking having a lot of social

100
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,860
aspect but then also there's a business

101
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,560
aspect to it right and so just a great

102
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,139
balance and uh what there's no better

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,360
City to have it in no and the food is

104
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,340
amazing I mean we have a great time yeah

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,139
you know and I think

106
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,519
we don't have to worry about covid now

107
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,319
so that makes it a little better there

108
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,459
was a couple you know it was I was

109
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,860
worried a little bit this year because

110
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,418
the year before we had to wear masks you

111
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,979
know and that was kind of like it was a

112
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,500
little bummer the the

113
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:09,659
the amount of people attending wasn't

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,759
very high the previous year this year

115
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,699
was like kova didn't exist it was great

116
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,800
yeah yeah the the amount of people it

117
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,040
just it was no holds bar there was just

118
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,000
so Betty yeah tremendous time so going

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,259
back so you started smoking uh early 90s

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,199
late 80s

121
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,960
um I've I've always smoked like uh

122
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,478
through the 80s 90s yeah nice yeah and

123
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:37,319
uh you know growing up in the midwest

124
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,418
it's uh it's really hard to find good

125
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,538
flour I bet

126
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:45,839
um but that's all changed now but back

127
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:48,659
in the day I mean it was all brick weed

128
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,638
occasionally get some Thai stick but uh

129
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,080
there really wasn't a lot to choose from

130
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,160
yeah

131
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:58,139
so how did you transition from going as

132
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,840
a cultivator into breeding and when did

133
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,319
that occur was that a long time ago you

134
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,879
saw that was in the early 2000s like

135
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,599
2003 for

136
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:14,399
um I became uh very good friends with uh

137
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:19,199
had it slot who owned Magus genetics out

138
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:22,379
of Amsterdam uh I had met him actually I

139
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,300
had bought seeds from uh the Bluebird

140
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,918
Coffee Shop

141
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,860
um in Amsterdam and out of the 20 packs

142
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,379
that I bought the the Warlock was one of

143
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,780
my favorites and

144
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:40,978
um so I went to the High Times cup like

145
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:45,299
a year later and uh Garrett or had it

146
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:47,939
had a booth at the High Times cup and so

147
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,418
I went up to him started talking to him

148
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:54,060
and and I said you know your uh

149
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:57,240
Holland's best kept secret it because

150
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,519
the genetics that I found from those

151
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,600
those seeds were just some of my

152
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:07,799
favorite and we talked for four hours

153
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:12,000
straight and we really connected and he

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:17,220
was really My Mentor in uh selection for

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,978
plants and uh because I had smoked the

156
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,139
Cinderella 99

157
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:24,478
seeds that I had and

158
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,840
um I really connected with the plant

159
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,240
this was I'd love the cerebral high but

160
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,279
it had like an Indica

161
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,780
um

162
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,538
aftertaste to it so it was like a roller

163
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,739
coaster to me that complexity was really

164
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:40,500
interesting and it's something that

165
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:44,160
really motivated me so

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,860
um I talked to uh Garrett about how can

167
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,919
I keep this in case I lose my mother

168
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:54,180
plants and uh so he helped me with

169
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:56,818
selection what to look for and so I went

170
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,280
I took five different families of the

171
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,139
Cinderella 99 that was available at that

172
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,258
time this was back in the Egyptian

173
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:08,460
Urbana days so I bred uh the different

174
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,960
uh selected plants to come up with what

175
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,959
I ended up calling the Cinderella 99

176
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,899
back cross and so that was my first

177
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,538
project and

178
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,779
um Garrett told me that

179
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:25,259
um gypsy one of his favorite strains was

180
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,059
the a Cinderella 99 he said well you

181
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,620
know if you have so many seeds why don't

182
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,819
you send them some and you know he can

183
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,918
distribute them I'll come out of his

184
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,979
freebies I'm like okay this was a great

185
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:39,120
idea so I did that and

186
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:41,879
um uh Gypsy gave some of those seeds to

187
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,099
Crazy composer who used to be a senior

188
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,899
editor for high times and he did a Blog

189
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,240
on it and he said it was the best

190
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,879
example of pineapple Fino of the

191
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,459
Cinderella 99 he's ever grown and all

192
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,200
sudden everybody wanted them right and

193
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,879
then

194
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:02,940
Gypsy said to me well I guess this time

195
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:05,338
you get uh your own page and so I had to

196
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,040
all sudden put a seed company together

197
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,220
and it was all based on the Cinderella

198
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:14,159
99 and they sold out like with uh within

199
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,000
the the first 15 minutes it was just it

200
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:21,600
it started with the bang that's awesome

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,320
uh I've done uh projects that uh

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,740
included the moonshine one of DJ shorts

203
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,600
sure uh short-lived strains he stopped

204
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,259
working with it because of the high

205
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,800
number of mutations in the line and so I

206
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:41,338
had sourced two packs from some Icy

207
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:44,338
Maggers and uh

208
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,399
um started working with them and found

209
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,980
uh some male and female keepers

210
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,740
and then did that line and then I

211
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,519
started doing projects on my own based

212
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,680
on

213
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,778
um you know different strains that I

214
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,479
liked and

215
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,679
um you know that was a good uh 17 years

216
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,740
ago that have been growing

217
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,979
professionally now that's awesome yeah

218
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,959
so you're in Illinois right now yes

219
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,778
how is uh how's the market over there

220
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,778
the market is very strong

221
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:18,120
um yeah there's uh the dispensaries that

222
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:20,700
keep adding dispensaries

223
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,740
um the numbers wise

224
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,839
um they're selling um you know hundreds

225
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,759
of millions dollars a month right

226
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,339
through dispensaries we've been

227
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,039
fortunate that some of our strains have

228
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,800
been included in the dispensaries we've

229
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:38,399
worked with a company called New Era now

230
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,159
Legacy IL uh but they've put our

231
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,980
raspberry Boogie into the dispensaries

232
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:47,399
and then now uh under release strain

233
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:51,659
called root beer Mac and so mean genes

234
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:54,480
uh root beer yeah uh with capillators uh

235
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,278
Mac and uh is it hazy because I feel

236
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,620
like everything bred with that Mac ends

237
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,240
up hazy yeah there is definitely a haze

238
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,700
like this dominance yeah there's this

239
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,519
dominance that comes from that Mac yeah

240
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,680
you know that Colombian side of you know

241
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,720
good or bad however you want to take it

242
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,799
it's it's a hard breeder you know and

243
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,200
it's

244
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,240
I think Mach One is a beautiful plant I

245
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,500
think it's amazing looking but it's a

246
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,399
really tough plant to breed with

247
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,620
properly yeah yeah and uh so you know it

248
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,379
all comes down to selection right you

249
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,560
know and that's it's a numbers game so

250
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:31,620
the larger sample size you have the more

251
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,179
more likely that you're gonna find what

252
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,100
you're looking for

253
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,078
yeah especially with something like that

254
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,120
where you have something so dominant you

255
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:42,359
want a larger gene pool to select from

256
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,240
100 I agree uh some stuff you don't need

257
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,600
a thousand seeds to go through you might

258
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,860
need a hundred you might need 150 you

259
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
know I I think

260
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,940
over a thousand is a little crazy some

261
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,420
people do that but you know what's your

262
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,100
magic number for uh selections uh we

263
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,919
like to do

264
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,500
um 50 okay but then

265
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,019
um like if we've done a run outdoors I

266
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,940
mean we've done 300 yeah

267
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:13,620
um but I think

268
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:16,740
um if you select your uh parental stock

269
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,039
properly then

270
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:23,039
um you're gonna get uh what you want out

271
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,778
of you know a 50 sample size right so

272
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,338
well the more you know the line the

273
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,259
better I think at the end of the day

274
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,760
what people don't understand is like the

275
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,519
more you breed with stuff you understand

276
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,980
what the male and what the female or

277
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,639
donor or male or donor or what the

278
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,500
female is contributing and you a lot of

279
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,059
times know what you're looking for so it

280
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,339
makes it a lot easier and you know if

281
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,778
you're gonna have to pop 100 seeds or

282
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,740
you're gonna have to pop 50 seeds or

283
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,500
you'll probably find what you're looking

284
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,139
for in a smaller amount like 15 or 20.

285
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,799
yeah true true and

286
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:58,620
um you know the the whole final Hunt is

287
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,379
the entire process because it starts

288
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,360
from labeling correctly from when you

289
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,519
plant those seeds because if you're

290
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,139
doing you know

291
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,299
um three four five strains a 50 each you

292
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,879
need to make sure everything's

293
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,819
documented properly and sometimes more

294
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,759
than just one label do you do a steak

295
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,560
and a collar tag yeah yeah we've talked

296
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,240
about this before both we're on the same

297
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,219
page on this one for sure

298
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,159
and it's so easy to get stuff mixed up

299
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,060
and also just getting rid of the wrong

300
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,480
plants when you're doing the selection

301
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,278
process growing them out multiple times

302
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,079
I used to grow them out once and do my

303
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,639
selections and that's really not the way

304
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,338
to do it

305
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,360
um so how many times do you grow them

306
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,000
out

307
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,320
um at least two but preferably three

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,600
yeah

309
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,500
and what are you typically looking for

310
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:57,720
uh when you're doing your selections so

311
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:02,159
um I I believe that with selections you

312
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,339
you have to look for the most ideal

313
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,259
plants of what we consider ideal and so

314
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,860
for me

315
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:13,919
um it's the bud does it have

316
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:17,159
um when the dry is that bag appeal does

317
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,219
it have that loud Aroma to it

318
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,259
um what's the high like

319
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,040
um so

320
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,799
um

321
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,599
you know there's things like that people

322
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,639
talk about oh they they want a really

323
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,079
heavy yielder well that's not

324
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,299
necessarily you know the the best for

325
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:40,379
quality in today's market California

326
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:42,719
Illinois you know everywhere it's all

327
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:46,019
about quality

328
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,440
um and once you start doing proper Fino

329
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,240
hunts and working the whole lines

330
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,060
through a process

331
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,500
you understand what that means right and

332
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,659
you don't necessarily want to prioritize

333
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,379
Quality quality not quality sorry

334
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:03,120
prioritize uh yield right I think

335
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:04,259
prioritizing quality is the most

336
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,600
important thing

337
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,740
and yield can be down on the list of

338
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,899
things because there's a commercial

339
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,360
viability aspect of it especially at

340
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,458
scale when people are growing you know

341
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,159
rooms of it for instance

342
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,439
but you know I think the first thing for

343
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:22,259
me is always flavor effect yeah effect

344
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,800
is super important too right but like

345
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:27,539
Flavor speaks highly flavor Chasers I'm

346
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,519
a flavor Chaser you're a flavor Chaser

347
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:30,958
you know we're doing some projects

348
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,639
together we're all we're all about

349
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,198
chasing flavors at the end of the day I

350
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,620
like

351
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:40,078
a variety of flavors too so jumping into

352
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,919
that what are the flavors that you like

353
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:49,138
you know I like the the whole Spectrum I

354
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:52,198
mean I love the ogs I love fruity I love

355
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,720
um something that's unique and different

356
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:58,379
um like your cereals yeah I mean that

357
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,920
brings a lot to the mix it's just

358
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:05,220
um the the taste is really something

359
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,958
really special so it's not just one

360
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,459
thing it's definitely multiple things

361
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:13,919
but those are the flavors that uh I like

362
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,578
but I like something

363
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,639
um

364
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:21,539
that I I really like like the Skittles

365
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,639
yeah you know I smoked uh a joint the

366
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:26,879
other day at this concert and it was

367
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:30,180
just I had some hash in it his Skittles

368
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,679
hash with the Skittles flower it was off

369
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,659
off the hook well you should taste that

370
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,039
because that one right there is just a

371
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,958
flower and I don't think you need any

372
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,578
hash with it all right I think that's

373
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,578
the one we'll do

374
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,220
so I got myself I'm Fino hunting so I

375
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:50,639
need to go through some of these flavors

376
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,720
but I got this is a

377
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,600
zero zbx so it's the soul yeah

378
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,100
so the loops

379
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,139
and uh

380
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,778
we found some candy ones which is great

381
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:06,179
you know going back through them and

382
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:07,798
uh oh yeah

383
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,079
pretty good flavor though right off the

384
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,879
bat you taste it yeah yeah and it's down

385
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,678
to that roach if you were to re-fire the

386
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,520
roach a month later you'd probably taste

387
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,140
it

388
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,139
that says something right there

389
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,019
you know and when you find flour that

390
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,040
tastes like it smells

391
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:28,039
that's special

392
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,100
yeah I mean

393
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:33,178
you do a lot of funeral hunting as well

394
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,879
and

395
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,980
going through it's like

396
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,620
there's a lot of stuff that can be

397
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,900
misleading where the nose in the bag is

398
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,939
so amazing and then you go to smoke it

399
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,798
and it's a letdown

400
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,679
you know it's it's all over the Spectrum

401
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,960
yeah or even the look it may have great

402
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,140
bag appeal so much stuff they're the

403
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,600
Oreos yeah right Oreos has great bag of

404
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,038
peel it looks super sexy but then when

405
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,899
it comes to smoking it it's like

406
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,099
cardboard chips I'm not really into

407
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,320
those

408
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,939
terp profiles like that where it does

409
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,259
have Terps it just has like this

410
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,480
chocolatey funkiness that I'm not super

411
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,640
yeah I'm not impressed by but I'm not

412
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,819
it's not something I I go out and look

413
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,780
for right right yeah

414
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:21,000
um

415
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:24,178
yeah but it is uh

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,319
it is really great to Define some good

417
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:31,140
combinations uh like uh I brought some

418
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,200
of the flour for you to uh to look at

419
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,179
the cereals raspberry Boogie

420
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,160
um because to me that does hit on all

421
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,298
cylinders but uh yeah so that's what

422
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,860
we're looking for people know about the

423
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,079
zeros but let's talk about the raspberry

424
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:45,000
Boogie so this is our collaboration that

425
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,399
we've been working on for God we've been

426
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,960
working over a year yeah yep

427
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
um yeah two years we've exchanged yeah

428
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,460
almost two years we've exchanged a bunch

429
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,380
of genetics and we share stuff and uh

430
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,700
you know and we're able to hang out

431
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,200
enough to where we can smoke stuff

432
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,058
together and kind of talk about it but

433
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,860
let's talk about the raspberry boogie in

434
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,079
the history of that yeah so the

435

aftertaste that resonates on your

492
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,839
palette it's kind of like a black line

493

Reserve

494

495
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,100
almost like yes where it's super lime

496
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,759
and you taste the lime but it's Sprite

497
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:05,158
yep yes yeah candy but not Skittles I

498
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,619
like that exactly and I brought some

499
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,260
flour for you to try out nice yeah that

500
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:12,899
is awesome so yeah so working on uh the

501
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,339
Mountain Dews I have some others in the

502
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,340
works

503
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:20,879
um and so you know as a breeder in

504
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:24,298
developing new cultivars

505
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,140
um you know I've learned that if you

506
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:30,000
have like a a strain uh that you're

507
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,740
working on and for example

508
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,679
um I've been working on unicorn poop

509
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:38,058
Cross of the pink animal crackers

510
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:41,519
great bag appeal great structure

511
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:44,399
phenomenal High Tour but she doesn't

512
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,679
have that loud nose and we've grown out

513
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,259
you know hundreds of does it smoke loud

514
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,419
or no it smokes loud smoke does not

515
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:52,980
taste loud so the funny thing is is like

516
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,600
for me personally like I don't at the

517
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,058
end of the day if it tastes loud and it

518
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,699
tastes amazing I don't mind if it's not

519
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:01,798
loud in the bag it's okay like I mean I

520
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,720
wanted I want it to be because it's a

521
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,279
good selling point but at the end of the

522
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,440
day if it's like a sleeper and nobody

523
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,119
knows about it and it smokes amazing

524
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,240
that's okay too especially if the high

525
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,500
is good yeah so this is more like a

526
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,720
sleeper

527
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,359
um but I wanted to give her some flavor

528
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,460
so I crossed her to the raspberry Boogie

529
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,839
yeah because she delivers and it comes

530
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,419
to that and

531
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,538
um brought some flour for you to sample

532
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,880
yeah you grow really really really

533
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:31,740
Frosty good delicious flour everything

534
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,900
I've had from you has been that the

535
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,000
raspberry Boogie uh zerios was amazing

536
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,559
it had seeds in it and I Still Smoked it

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,019
you know I kept the seeds obviously but

538
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,240
yeah man that was some good stuff like

539
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:45,480
and it's it's funky it's got a funky

540
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,819
like uh almost sour raspberry like sour

541
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:52,500
cherry and raspberry flavor to it which

542
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:55,740
is really special yeah and um a very uh

543
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,038
Thick Smoke to her yeah um that is yeah

544
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,960
like a creaminess is that that so the

545
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,879
cereal milk in the cereals with the it's

546
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,038
like zerbert which has the skittle

547
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,659
sherbet and then that's cereal milk it

548
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,119
adds this nice creaminess to a lot of

549
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,919
the Finos so you look at the the loops

550
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,139
that we were doing a lot of them had

551
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,600
that bready creaminess that like really

552
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,700
it makes it for a Thick Smoke yeah a lot

553
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,918
of fun yeah it sure is

554
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,380
um and then a third project that I've

555
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:27,840
been working on uh is collaborate

556
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:31,260
operation with BJ SOG Army and that's

557
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,240
um working with pink ZaZa and we've done

558
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,740
some crosses with her yeah he's a really

559
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,700
good dude in fact that's one of the

560
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,759
people you're visiting here in

561
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,798
California yes yes uh we've been uh

562
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,740
together for three days visiting Farms

563
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,859
going to the concerts going to concerts

564
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,380
yes yes

565
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:52,079
in Oakland great time just really good

566
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,720
times I sold out for like three days

567
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,399
cool good stuff

568
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,759
so let's dive into some breeding talk

569
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,200
okay so as far as reversals you know

570
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,599
we've been chatting on the phone about

571
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,900
reversals for the last five years yes

572
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,879
yes so yeah and I think you uh you were

573
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,460
at a point where you're struggling and

574
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,679
you have worked it all out and I it's

575
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,140
it's such an individual thing for people

576
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,298
the reversal side I think it's a lot

577
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,620
more difficult than people think and

578
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:22,139
there's a lot of trial and error

579
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,178
involved and each room is different you

580
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,140
know I can write an sop for it but that

581
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,640
doesn't mean that it's going to work

582
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,020
perfectly the first time in your room

583
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,840
right

584
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,879
looking back with everything that you

585
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:37,459
know now what would you tell yourself

586
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,460
about that uh when you first started

587
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,119
um

588
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:45,058
take the time

589
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:49,798
to really think through the different

590
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:52,319
steps of the process because you know we

591
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,179
as farmers are very busy all the time

592
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,339
because there's you know a hundred and

593
00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:00,000
one things that need to be done so you

594
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:02,639
prioritize those and really take the

595
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,700
time take them through so that way you

596
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,640
ensure that each each step of uh

597
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,120
breeding or reversal is done properly

598
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,000
yeah because I have found if I look back

599
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:17,399
at my steps of you know either

600
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,819
something's gone perfect you know better

601
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,519
than expected or uh terrible you know

602
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:25,500
it's not things are not working properly

603
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,778
and a lot of times you don't know until

604
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,700
after taking notes is one of your big

605
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:32,038
ones yeah yeah definitely keep a

606
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,380
notebook yep for each room that you're

607
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,640
working on because you know I mentioned

608
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,278
that we were doing four or five

609
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,720
reversals at a time yeah you got to keep

610
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:41,759
them all separate and keep them all

611
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,038
organized so yeah yeah we have a 14

612
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,599
light reversal room here where we we're

613
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:47,940
testing we're doing a lot of r d in

614
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,500
there as well but yeah taking notes is

615
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,140
essential

616
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,640
um not using LEDs is great I mean some

617
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,700
people get great results and that's fine

618
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm glad they do my light spectrum of

619
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:03,058
choice is HPS ah okay 600 thousands what

620
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,278
whatever single ended doubling it used

621
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:08,278
to be 600s now without I use thousands

622
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,319
it's great but yeah the Des the HPS I

623
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,419
think is the way to go and then cutting

624
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,158
the nutrition by 50 percent

625
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,460
nice nice

626
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,980
yeah so uh do you find that when you do

627
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,200
that the plants turn more yellow on the

628
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,200
lower leaves I would say that the plants

629
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,179
stress more uh with the HPS and then

630
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,980
cutting the nutrition

631
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,059
um you could even cut the ppfd a little

632
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,759
bit but what you're trying to do is

633
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:34,259
stress the plant out and uh in

634
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,940
combination with the silver and the

635
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:39,359
stress I use a nano silver that's

636
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,038
sprayed every other day from about seven

637
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,379
to ten days before depending on the

638
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,298
cultivar till about seven to ten days

639
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,520
after depending on once you start seeing

640
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:51,200
signs but yeah what's what's your method

641
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:54,839
so we use STS and I use Garrett slots

642
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,700
proprietary method is that the four four

643
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:02,819
to one but it's a proprietary yeah but

644
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,519
yeah yeah yeah yeah so it is proprietary

645
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,399
but I will tell you that it's very

646
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:12,119
stable we start like a month before the

647
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,960
reversal oh wow um to uh spraying up in

648
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:18,538
two weeks into so it's a dose of STS yes

649
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,700
yes definitely not the four to one maybe

650
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,919
yeah so it's not stressful on the plant

651
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,720
yeah and because it's a very stressful

652
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,559
thing for the plant to reverse its sex

653
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,839
you know so let's not add to that and

654
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:32,759
I've had Distributors uh say like pure

655
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,959
sativa that

656
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,819
um the seeds produced with that reversal

657
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,220
there's zero intersex traits he never

658
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:44,339
gets complaints about our seeds or

659
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,519
Garrett seeds yeah and because it works

660
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:50,399
so I would rather take a longer time

661
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,460
reversing a plant knowing that the

662
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,500
outcome is going to be what we want it

663
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,319
to be right so but you know Mother

664
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,859
Nature still does her thing so what is

665
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,319
it one out of every 4 000 will be a male

666
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:06,719
oh no I mean you can have the the

667
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,038
express males and especially if you're

668
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,860
field testing that's a whole different

669
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:14,879
story yeah you know one in a thousand is

670
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,740
likely to express some sort of uh male

671
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,320
you know male plant but you can get full

672
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,538
male expression and it's just very

673
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,980
cultivar specific or cross-specific like

674
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:24,898
if you're dealing with Autos it's

675
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,860
depending on

676
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:28,979
um

677
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,839
a lot of factors and but you know really

678
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,339
stable stuff it should be like one in a

679
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,658
thousand like that's considered stable

680
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:36,959
if you have one in four thousand that's

681
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:39,480
awesome that is just yeah that's that's

682
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,940
what uh some books and some of these

683
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,399
yeah I mean the the Autoflower varieties

684
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,840
yeah if you're getting like one in a

685
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,278
thousand that's that's not too bad but

686
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,619
fifty but you got to think if you're

687
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,200
putting 15 000 of those out per acre

688
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:55,439
you're gonna have 15 plants you've got

689
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,360
to pull yeah right you know and I think

690
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,558
in the beginning a lot of guys were just

691
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,359
they just let it do their thing and

692
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,859
stuff will get seated but you know if

693
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,259
you have a good trained staff you can

694
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:05,879
pull those out you can you can identify

695
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:07,500
them before they're an issue especially

696
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,240
especially the ones that are fully

697
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,460
expressing yeah but you got to take the

698
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,399
time to be in there with the plants to

699
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,840
really be able to uh identify because

700
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,819
they were walking through the fields

701
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,538
yeah that's a lot of walking but you

702
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:24,240
know it is what it is yeah but you know

703
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:25,379
um it's a beautiful thing yeah it really

704
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,419
is so

705
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,200
yeah seeing Acres of Autoflower just

706
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:34,140
makes me smile right no no crappy days

707
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,259
there no I I agree with you

708
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,360
um proper reversal techniques are so so

709
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:43,259
important for breeding because now

710
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:47,939
everyone every once one wants to grow uh

711
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:50,759
feminized seeds uh uh for you know the

712
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,620
the different state requirements for how

713
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:55,079
many personal plants you can have at

714
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:59,038
home growing so

715
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:01,918
um would you say that 75 of your seed

716
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,658
sales are feminized and 25 are reg or

717
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,960
would you say it's even more I would say

718
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:09,960
mine is probably 90 10. mine's actually

719
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,460
more we still offer a few strains

720
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,079
regular because there are people still

721
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,058
looking yeah I have them too I offer a

722
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,398
lot regular but as far as what people

723
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:21,658
buy people really buy feminized seeds

724
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:25,139
mostly and uh yeah we're like 95 now so

725
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:29,700
yeah now 95 98 we'll we'll see you know

726
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:32,100
the occasional pink lemonade or um

727
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,140
um Mountain Dew other breeders buying

728
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:36,178
them I get other breeders and I'm super

729
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,799
happy you know to be honest I'm super

730
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,480
happy when other people buy my rigs to

731
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:41,460
breed with I think that's a good thing

732
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,380
some readers are like oh you should ask

733
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,058
permission don't you buy someone's

734
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,980
regular seeds right they don't ask

735
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:48,658
permission go ahead and use them go

736
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,599
ahead and breed with them breed your

737
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:53,340
heart's content and you know I'm just

738
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,019
happy people are you know buying my

739
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:57,298
genetics and are happy with them I think

740
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,918
you know there's it's you know it's a

741
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:00,240
personal thing but also it's like we're

742
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,038
breeding for other people and we're

743
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,319
breeding for the world I breed for what

744
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,538
I like a lot of times but I also am

745
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,519
aware of where the Market's going and

746
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:11,038
what people like and I want to have a

747
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,778
variety of all this stuff yeah no I I

748
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:13,740
think that's good because you know when

749
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:16,200
you

750
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,880
um look at the different states east

751
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,538
coast is different than West Coast

752
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,539
totally Midwest is different and so you

753
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:27,500
know what might be popular like uh Sour

754
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:30,058
Diesel in New York you know it might be

755
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,759
Skittles something here yeah they got

756
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:35,940
some pith your pith is a big thing now

757
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,278
yeah yeah those hazes I mean the pith

758
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,440
yeah the pif is super big the the black

759
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:41,700
Cuban Haze yes those are all real

760
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,798
popular

761
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,019
they started here though by the way just

762
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:47,700
so people remember I started in Santa

763
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,558
Cruz with the haze you know the Hayes

764
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,980
Brothers yes yes

765
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:55,859
uh back in the day uh I grew Neville's

766
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,679
Haze yeah you know greenhouse seeds and

767
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,839
I love Neville's I love the A5 the A5 is

768
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,460
a Neville's Haze yes and that was the

769
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,439
closest thing there is to cat piss

770
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,360
without being cat pissed it was straight

771
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,419
ammonia it just didn't have the skunk

772
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:12,298
behind it yeah yeah no that she's she's

773
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:14,820
great I've run her uh many times yeah

774
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:17,879
beautiful plant but uh so yeah so

775
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:19,558
depending on you know what's popular or

776
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,600
what they're looking for

777
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:24,359
um you know Oklahoma whatever

778
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:27,298
um then it's good to have that variety

779
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,339
yeah because somebody wants it somewhere

780
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:31,980
so totally you know and I think as

781
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:34,500
breeders we we want to make sure we're

782
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,839
giving people a good selection that's

783
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,240
right that's what we do yeah and they've

784
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,918
given people options you know because we

785
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,659
want variety we want people to breed

786
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,940
variety

787
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,380
um you know but the funny thing is you

788
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,640
know in the United States just like in

789
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,919
Europe they went towards everything

790
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,620
Hayes before Hayes there was a lot more

791
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,059
variety there too but we bottleneck

792
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:55,678
because we get so excited about stuff

793
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:57,720
and then there's the hype and then you

794
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,759
know these exotic streams now it's like

795
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,440
yeah everyone's jumped on and I gotta

796
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,599
have gelato and really there's so much

797
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,399
other stuff out there gelato is great I

798
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,839
have no problem with it but there's a

799
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,179
ton of other stuff

800
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,559
you know going through like like what

801
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,440
we're doing with our project with the

802
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,659
raspberry Boogie zeros yes yeah so

803
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,240
totally different direction and you know

804
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,579
what I think that's the beauty of a a

805
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,039
good collaboration yeah is you're going

806
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,898
to come up with something that's

807
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,418
um you know from the best from both of

808
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:29,699
us right it's a piece of piece of two

809
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,319
different people yeah right and put

810
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,000
together to make something better and I

811
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,859
think

812
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,539
breeding with intention is so important

813
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:38,398
and I think it's a lot of time

814
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:40,619
overlooked they're like I just crossed

815
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,838
this with this like I believe in

816
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,338
intentional reading and the the stuff we

817
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,139
do together that's intentional breeding

818
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:48,119
we're purposely Crossing these things

819
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,378
together with the intent of getting

820
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,679
something that's somewhere in the middle

821
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:55,079
that has something that's part of each

822
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,398
that's beautiful you know yeah some some

823
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,098
good contributing factor and the

824
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,719
raspberry Boogie's got a lot of Terps

825
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,920
zerios has a lot of chirps you know

826
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,699
together you're getting stuff that's

827
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,720
real terpy but raspberry then you get

828
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:11,519
creamy candy from the zerio so it's you

829
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,799
know it's it's just a good complex thing

830
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,960
and breeding with intent like that

831
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,019
you're gonna improve the gene pool

832
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,820
rather than either you know stay the

833
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,739
same or bring it down it's like it's

834
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,780
constant Improvement these little

835
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,000
constant things that we're improving and

836
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,760
you know you do something good and it

837
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,920
could be around forever true true yeah

838
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,800
we we all know a whole bunch that are

839
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,720
like that but you know that's the the

840
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,140
